**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Gutierrez***

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Melody Gutierrez y Lauriada*, G.R. No. 187156, September 08, 2009 (615 Phil. 73).

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of the accused for violations of Republic Act No. 9165 (RA 9165), the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.  Specifically, violations of Sections 5 (sale of dangerous drugs) and 11 (possession of dangerous drugs) of Article II.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Buy-bust Operation:** Accused was arrested in a buy-bust operation based on information from a confidential informant. The accused sold shabu to a poseur-buyer (PO1 Orante).
*   **Charges:** Accused was charged with and convicted of: (1) selling 0.02 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) in violation of Section 5, RA 9165; and (2) possession of three sachets of shabu (0.02 gram each) in violation of Section 11, RA 9165.
*   **Accused's Defense:** Denied the charges, claiming she was picked up and framed.
*   **Evidence:** Marked money used in the buy-bust, the shabu itself (identified via forensic analysis), and testimony of police officers involved in the operation.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The CA found that the chain of custody of the seized drugs was properly established. This included the spot report, acknowledgement receipt, and delivery to the PNP Crime Laboratory. The accused admitted the execution and authenticity of the Physical Science Report during the pre-trial.

**Obligations:**

*   The accused had the obligation to not sell or possess dangerous drugs in violation of RA 9165.
*   The Prosecution has the obligation to present evidence proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt for the charges against her.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Case No. 07-286 (Sale):** Life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 (affirmed).
*   **Criminal Case No. 07-287 (Possession):** Modified by the Supreme Court. The RTC's indeterminate sentence was deemed erroneous as it did not provide for the maximum penalty. The SC imposed an indeterminate sentence of 12 years and 1 day (minimum) to 17 years, 4 months, and 1 day (maximum), plus a fine of P300,000.00 (affirmed).

**Potential Risks/Issues:**

*   **Confidential Informant:** The defense questioned the failure to present the confidential informant as a witness. While the Court upheld the conviction without the informant's testimony, the lack of cross-examination presents a potential line of argument for future appeals or collateral attacks (though unlikely to succeed based on this ruling).
*   **Forensic Chemist:** The defense questioned the failure to present the forensic chemist as a witness. However, since the Defense admitted the execution and authenticity of the Physical Science Report during the pre-trial, the CA stated that this did not diminish the integrity of the testimonies of the other prosecution witnesses.
*   **Chain of Custody:** While the CA and SC found the chain of custody to be sufficiently established, any break in the chain of custody could create reasonable doubt and jeopardize the conviction, as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs could be compromised.
*   **Penalty:** the RTC's error in the penalty imposed for illegal possession (Criminal Case No. 07-287) highlights the importance of strict adherence to the Indeterminate Sentence Law.
*   **One-witness Testimonies:** Accused claimed that the sole eyewitness testimony of PO1 Orante to the sale was insufficient to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The CA held that what is material is proof that the transaction took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the corpus delicti as evidence, both of which were proven by the testimony of PO1 Orante. Contrary to accused's contention, the consummation of the sale was corroborated by MADAC Operative Dela Pe√±a.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):**  Primary statute violated.  Specifically, Article II, Sections 5 and 11.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied by the Supreme Court to correct the penalty imposed by the RTC in Criminal Case No. 07-287.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The original trial raised the issue of whether the prosecution was able to prove the elements of the illegal sale of shabu, on one hand, and the illegal possession of a dangerous drug on the other, but the RTC held that they were able to prove it with the testimonial and physical evidence provided.
*   The accused argued that the testimonies of one witness should not have been enough to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt, but the court held that this was not true because her testimonies were corroborated by the other prosecution witnesses.
