## Legal Document Summary: *Diana T. Lao, Rowena O. Tan and Wilson O. Tan vs. Ramon G. Co, et al.*, G.R. No. 168198

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's dismissal of a Petition for Certiorari. Underlying issue: Probable cause for falsification of public documents.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Complaint:** Petitioners (Lao, Tans) filed a criminal complaint against Respondents (Co, et al.) for falsification of public documents, specifically Deeds of Assignment of shares in Leecauco to Moly Chiu, Inc.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:** Forgery of signatures on Deeds of Assignment; denial of execution and appearance before notaries.
*   **City Prosecutor's Resolution:** Dismissed for insufficiency of evidence, requiring expert opinion on forgery due to the document's public nature and signature similarity.
*   **DOJ Resolutions:**
    *   1st DOJ: Dismissed the appeal for lack of merit.
    *   2nd DOJ: Granted motion for reconsideration, ordering referral to NBI for expert analysis and reinvestigation.
    *   3rd DOJ: Granted Respondents' motion for reconsideration, reinstated the 1st DOJ Resolution dismissing the complaint.
*   **CA Ruling:** Dismissed Petition for Certiorari for failure to file Motion for Reconsideration of 3rd DOJ Resolution and non-compliance with Rule 46, Section 3 (submission of machine copies instead of duplicate originals of DOJ resolutions).

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioners had the obligation to demonstrate probable cause of falsification.
*   Petitioners had the obligation to comply with procedural rules for filing a Petition for Certiorari (Rule 46, Section 3).

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential criminal liability for Respondents if probable cause for falsification is established.
*   Petitioners bear the cost of the suit.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioners:** Failure to prove forgery jeopardizes potential claims based on share ownership in Leecauco. The court noted the absence of corroborating evidence to support their claims of forgery beyond their self-serving allegations.
*   **Respondents:** Potential for future legal action if new evidence surfaces regarding the authenticity of the Deeds of Assignment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Petition for Review on Certiorari.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 46, Section 3:** Requirements for filing a Petition for Certiorari (duplicate original or certified true copies of rulings).
*   **2000 National Prosecution Service Rule on Appeal, Section 13 (DOJ Circular No. 70):** Prohibits second or further Motions for Reconsideration.
*   ***Balindong v. CA*** (G.R. No. 159962, 16 December 2004): Mandatory nature of DOJ Circular No. 70, Section 13.
*   ***Bautista v. CA*** (413 Phil 159, 2001): Definition of probable cause.
*   ***Santos v. Go*** (G.R. No. 156081, 19 October 2005): Courts will not interfere with the prosecutor's discretion to file or not file a criminal case unless with grave abuse of discretion.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The requirement for expert opinion on forgery. The Court acknowledges the prosecutor's discretion isn't solely dependent on this, but rather the totality of evidence. This leaves room for argument if alternative evidence could establish probable cause.
*   The CA's initial dismissal rationale (failure to file a motion for reconsideration) was deemed erroneous by the Supreme Court because another MR would have been prohibited as a second one, reiterating previously raised issues.

**Analysis:**

The case hinges on the procedural requirements for filing a Petition for Certiorari and the substantive issue of proving probable cause for falsification. The Supreme Court upheld the CA's dismissal, not due to the failure to file a motion for reconsideration, but based on the non-compliance with Rule 46, Section 3 and the petitioners' insufficient evidence to establish probable cause independent of expert testimony. While the prosecutor's discretion is respected, the lack of explicit explanation of why the totality of evidence was insufficient beyond the reference to expert testimony could be a point of contention in future proceedings if new evidence is discovered.
