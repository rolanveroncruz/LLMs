## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Perez @ Dalegdeg*, G.R. No. 182924

**Type:** Criminal Case (Statutory Rape) - Review of Court of Appeals Decision.

**Case Summary:** Accused-Appellant Jose Perez was convicted of statutory rape of a 6-year-old victim, AAA. The RTC initially imposed the death penalty, but the CA reduced it to reclusion perpetua and awarded civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages. This appeal challenges the conviction based on insufficient evidence and alleged coaching of the victim.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Statutory Rape:** The case hinges on Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353 (Anti-Rape Law of 1997), defining statutory rape as carnal knowledge of a woman under 12 years old.
*   **Elements of the Crime:** The Court emphasizes the two essential elements: (1) accused had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (2) the victim was below 12 years old at the time of the offense.
*   **Proof of Penetration:** The Court clarifies that proof of penetration, not ejaculation, is sufficient for conviction. The prosecution presented medical evidence demonstrating hymenal lacerations, vulva contusions, and hematoma, all of which confirmed penile penetration.
*   **Victim Testimony:** Court ruled that a child's testimony is sufficient, especially given victim's very young age and innocence. They point out that the victim identified appellant as the perpetrator of the crime and that prosecution did not coach the witness, or place words in her mouth.
*   **Alibi and Denial:** The accused raised alibi and denial as defenses, which the Court considered weak and ultimately rejected due to inconsistencies, witness credibility, and failure to establish physical impossibility of being at the crime scene.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Conviction for statutory rape leading to reclusion perpetua. Not eligible for parole under Act No. 4103 (Indeterminate Sentence Law) due to RA 9346.
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   Civil Indemnity: P75,000.00 (mandatory upon finding of rape).
    *   Moral Damages: P75,000.00 (granted without need of proof, due to the moral injuries caused by the rape).
    *   Exemplary Damages: P25,000.00 (reduced from CA's award; warranted due to the aggravating circumstance of the victim being below seven years old).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Child Witness:** The Court addresses the defense's argument about the victim being coached. While acknowledging leading questions were used (permitted for child witnesses under Section 10, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court and Rule on Examination of a Child Witness), the court concludes that her testimony was not coached and that it was not suggested to her.
*   **Lack of Eyewitnesses:** The absence of eyewitnesses is addressed, stating that rape often occurs in private and that the victim's testimony alone, if credible, is sufficient for conviction.
*   **Medical Evidence:** The defense's claim that the medical findings (lack of semen) did not support rape is refuted. The Court clarifies that penetration, not ejaculation, is the key element, and the absence of semen can be explained by other factors (e.g., post-incident cleaning).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

**Ambiguities:**

*   **Extent of Injury:** The initial medical examination and subsequent testimony may need further scrutiny.
*   **Coaching/Leading the witness:** The Court ruled it did not take place, however, questions of the propriety of questioning child witnesses may be raised in future cases.
