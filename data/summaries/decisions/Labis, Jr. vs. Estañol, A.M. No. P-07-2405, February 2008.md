**Nature of the Case:** Disciplinary action against Genaro Estañol, a process server of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Himamaylan, Negros Occidental, for dereliction of duty.

*   **Respondent:** Genaro Estañol, process server of the same court.
*   **Charge:** Dereliction of duty based on two instances:
    *   Failure to make a return of service for a petition for indirect contempt, leading to postponement of hearing (August 12, 2005 case).
    *   Failure to serve summons and complaint in an ejectment case and to promptly attach the return, leading to postponement of hearing (September 28, 2005 case).
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Claimed loss of order and summons in the contempt case and argued that the defendant in the ejectment case had already vacated the premises, but admitted oversight in attaching the return.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** Guilty of dereliction of duty, fine of P5,000, and stern warning.
*   **Court Ruling:** Affirms OCA's finding of guilt of (simple) neglect of duty. The Supreme Court imposed a fine of P5,000 and a stern warning.
