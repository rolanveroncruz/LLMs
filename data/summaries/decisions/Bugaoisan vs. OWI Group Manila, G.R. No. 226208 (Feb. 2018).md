## Legal Document Summary: *Bugaoisan v. OWI Group Manila and Morris Corporation* (G.R. No. 226208)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45) of a CA Decision in a labor dispute.

**Key Provisions & Ruling:**

*   The SC **granted** the petition, reversing the CA and reinstating the NLRC's decision regarding the duration of the employment contract. The SC held that because CA found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC, the CA erred in ruling that petitioner's employment contract with Morris was for only one (1) year. The Court is precluded from doing an independent review of this factual matter since it has already been decided by the labor tribunals, unless the CA, in the certiorari petition, ascertains that the NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion.

*   **Constructive Illegal Dismissal:** The LA and NLRC ruled in favor of the petitioner, finding that she was constructively and illegally dismissed due to the oppressive working conditions imposed by the respondents (OWI Group Manila and Morris Corporation). This finding was affirmed by the CA.

*   **Employment Contract Duration Dispute:** The core issue revolves around the duration of the employment contract:
    *   **LA & NLRC:** 2-year contract
    *   **CA:** Modified to 1-year contract based on the "Master Employment Contract" submitted to POEA.
    *   **SC:** Reinstated 2-year contract duration finding that CA's decision was outside the scope of a petition for review under rule 65. The CA is only tasked to determine whether or not the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in its appreciation of factual issues presented before it by any parties.

*   **Monetary Award:** The LA awarded, and the NLRC affirmed, AUS$137,500.00 as salary for the remaining period of the 2-year employment contract, plus moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. The CA modified this, reducing the salary award based on the 1-year contract duration, the SC reinstated the NLRC's two year contract.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **OWI Group Manila & Morris Corporation:** Solidarily liable for the monetary award to the petitioner, including salary for the unexpired portion of the two-year employment contract, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Modification of Contract Terms:** The case highlights the risks associated with modifying employment contract terms after DOLE/POEA approval.  The CA's analysis hinged on whether the modification (regarding contract duration) was validly consented to.

*   **Scope of Certiorari Review (Rule 65):**  The SC emphasized that the CA's review under Rule 65 is limited to determining grave abuse of discretion by the NLRC. It cannot substitute its judgment on the merits of the case if no grave abuse of discretion is found.  *Montoya v. Transmed Manila Corporation* (613 Phil. 696 (2009)) is cited to support this principle.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:**  Governs petitions for review on certiorari.
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:**  Governs special civil actions for certiorari.
*   **Civil Code provisions on Perfection of Contracts:** Referencing elements of offer and acceptance.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The discrepancy between the initial employment contract duration (1 year) and the subsequent offer (potentially implying 2 years). The absence of the employee's signature on the alleged modified offer was a key point of contention.
*   The vagueness of the "offer of full time employment" and whether it constituted a valid modification of the original contract.
