## Legal Document Summary: *Republic v. Estate of Alfonso Lim, Sr.*

**Case:** *Republic of the Philippines v. Estate of Alfonso Lim, Sr., et al.*, G.R. No. 164800, July 22, 2009 (611 Phil. 37).

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing Sandiganbayan's denial of Republic's Motion for Writ of Preliminary Attachment in Civil Case No. 0030, an ill-gotten wealth recovery case.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Republic's Claim:** The Republic alleges that Alfonso Lim, Sr. (deceased) and Alfonso Lim, Jr., in collusion with Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos and Teodoro Q. Pe√±a, unjustly enriched themselves through various schemes. These schemes involved obtaining excessive timber concessions for Taggat Industries, Inc. (TAGGAT) and Pamplona Redwood Veneer, Inc. (PAMPLONA), managing logging concessions of other companies (Veterans Woodwork, Inc., Sierra Madre Wood Industries, Inc., and Tropical Philippines Wood Industries, Inc.), and obtaining favorable loan terms for PAMPLONA guaranteed by the Philippine government. Alleges violations of 1973 Constitution.
*   **Specific Allegations of Fraud:** The Republic primarily bases its claim on the fact that Lim, Sr. controlled timber concessions far exceeding the allowable limit under Section 11, Article XIV of the 1973 Constitution (100,000 hectares). This was allegedly facilitated by his close relationship with the Marcoses, constituting a grave abuse of power and unjust enrichment.  Reliance on the findings in the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) decision canceling the logging concessions.
*   **Motion for Writ of Preliminary Attachment:** The Republic sought a writ of preliminary attachment against the respondents' properties (listed in Annex "A" of the Complaint) to secure any future judgment in its favor.
*   **Sandiganbayan's Initial Ruling:** The Sandiganbayan initially denied the motion, citing insufficient evidence of specific fraudulent acts to justify the issuance of the writ under Rule 57, Section 1(d) of the Rules of Court.
*   **Demurrer to Evidence:** Respondents filed a demurrer to evidence. The Sandiganbayan *denied* the demurrer, effectively stating that the Republic had presented *prima facie* evidence of illegal and fraudulent acts.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Reversed** the Sandiganbayan's Resolutions denying the writ of preliminary attachment.
*   **Held:** The Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the writ because the Republic had sufficiently demonstrated fraud and the anti-graft court already ruled that the evidence so far presented by the Republic had been sufficient to support a finding that respondents had committed illegal and fraudulent acts against the Republic and the Filipino people
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   The Court found fraud evidenced by MNR decision Exhibit "B" showing Lim's excessive control over logging concessions.
    *   The Court found clear fraud commited by Lim and companies thru their access and enjoyement of excessive logging concessions using their relationship with the Marcoses
    *   The Supreme Court underscored Sandiganbayan's denial of the Demurrer to Evidence implying a *prima facie* case of fraud, and incongruent with the denial of the attachment writ.
    *   Attachment as a provisional remedy to ensure the safety and preservation of the thing attached until the plaintiff can obtain a judgement.
