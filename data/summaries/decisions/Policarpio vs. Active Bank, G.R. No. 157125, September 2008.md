## Legal Document Summary: *Policarpio v. Active Bank* (G.R. No. 157125)

**Case Summary:** This case concerns a petition challenging the issuance of a writ of possession in favor of Active Bank, the mortgagee, after foreclosure proceedings. The petitioner, Policarpio, claimed ownership of the property via a Deed of Sale from one of the registered owners, Septem Ricaza. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision upholding the trial court's issuance of the writ of possession.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Writ of Possession:** The central issue revolves around the propriety of the RTC issuing a writ of possession to Active Bank after foreclosure, despite Policarpio's claim as a third-party possessor.
*   **Section 33, Rule 39, Rules of Court:** The Court acknowledges that a writ of possession is generally a ministerial duty of the court unless a third party is in possession, claiming a right adverse to the mortgagor. However, the petitioner failed to adequately establish her adverse claim.
*   **Validity of Deed of Sale:** The Court found the Deed of Sale in favor of Policarpio questionable because it was signed only by one spouse (Septem Ricaza) without proof of authorization from the other spouse (Grelita Ricaza) regarding the sale of the conjugal property.
*   **Lack of Registration:** Critically, the Deed of Sale was *not* registered. This was a fatal defect, as a purchaser is charged with notice only of burdens and claims annotated on the title. Active Bank's mortgage *was* registered.
*   **Prior Mortgage:** The mortgage in favor of Active Bank preceded the unregistered sale to Policarpio, giving Active Bank superior rights.
*   **Constructive Notice:** Policarpio was deemed to have constructive notice of the mortgage due to its registration, negating her claim of good faith.
*   **Petitioner's Negligence:** The Court noted Policarpio, as a lawyer, should have been more diligent in ensuring the proper registration of the sale and investigating the title's burdens.
*   **Laches:** The CA originally considered laches because the Petitioner failed to pursue or prosecute her claim but the Supreme Court did not explicitly rely on laches in reaching its conclusion.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Active Bank (Mortgagee/Purchaser):** Entitled to possession of the property due to valid foreclosure and prior registered mortgage. No obligation to honor Policarpio's possession.
*   **Policarpio (Claimant):** Has a legal obligation to honor Active Bank's prior ownership and right to possession.  Is liable to be evicted.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Spousal Consent:** While the Court raised concerns about the lack of both spouses' signatures on the deed, the key determining factor was the lack of registration.
*   **Hearing on Adverse Possession:** The Court noted a hearing was conducted, but neither Policarpio nor her counsel appeared. This could be grounds for collateral attack if procedural due process was demonstrably violated.
*   **Implied Waiver of Spousal Rights:** The decision rests on the lack of signature but does not address the possibility of later ratification by the other spouse.
*   **Future Litigation:** The lack of registration of the Deed of Sale allows for potentially further litigation regarding the rights between the Spouses Ricaza and the Petitioner.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 33, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court:** Relates to the right to possession following an extrajudicial foreclosure sale.
*   **China Banking Corporation v. Ordinario:** Affirms the ministerial duty to issue a writ of possession.
*   **Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals:** Distinguished because the third-party possessor in PNB occupied the property *prior* to the mortgage and the bank was aware of their possession.
*   **Du v. Stronghold Insurance Co., Inc.:** Regarding notice of burdens on registered property.

**Conclusion:**

The decision strengthens the rights of mortgagees in foreclosure proceedings, emphasizing the importance of registration and constructive notice. Policarpio's failure to register her Deed of Sale, coupled with the prior registered mortgage, proved fatal to her claim of adverse possession.
