**Case Summary: Rombe Eximtrade (Phils.), Inc. vs. Asiatrust Development Bank (G.R. No. 164479)**

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision annulling orders of the RTC granting a writ of preliminary injunction.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in annulling the RTC order granting a preliminary injunction against the extrajudicial foreclosure initiated by Asiatrust, arguing that it interfered with a prior order dismissing Rombe's petition for suspension of payments and rehabilitation.

**Background:**

*   Rombe filed a petition for suspension of payments and rehabilitation (Civil Case No. 325-M-2002) which was dismissed by RTC Branch 7 due to Rombe's misrepresentations regarding its financial status and a lack of a feasible rehabilitation plan (violations of IRPCR).
*   Following dismissal of the petition and lifting of the Stay Order, Asiatrust initiated foreclosure proceedings on Rombe's properties.
*   Rombe then filed a separate action (Civil Case No. 906-M-2002) to annul the foreclosure documents and for damages, seeking a TRO and injunction, which was granted by RTC Branch 15.
*   The CA reversed the RTC Branch 15's orders, finding grave abuse of discretion due to perceived interference with Branch 7's order in the rehabilitation case.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Rombe's Argument:** The annulment case (Branch 15) involves a distinct cause of action from the rehabilitation case (Branch 7), and the injunction doesn't interfere with the dismissal of the rehabilitation petition.
*   **Asiatrust's Argument (Before CA):** The RTC Branch 15's injunction effectively overturned the RTC Branch 7's prior order lifting the stay order which allowed the foreclosure to proceed. Rombe lacked basis for seeking injunction.
*   **Supreme Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) GRANTED Rombe's petition, reversing the CA decision. The SC held that the nature, purpose, and reliefs sought in the rehabilitation case (a special proceeding to determine financial status) are dissimilar to those in the annulment case (an ordinary civil action to protect property rights). Therefore, the injunction did not interfere with the dismissed rehabilitation case.
*   The dismissal of the rehabilitation case had become final and so there was no proceeding to interfere with.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation (IRPCR):** Cited regarding requirements for rehabilitation petitions, including the submission of audited financial statements, inventory of assets, and a feasible rehabilitation plan. Violations resulted in dismissal of Rombe's petition.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 1, Sec. 3(a) & Rule 2, Sec. 2:** Defines civil action and cause of action, used to distinguish the annulment case from the rehabilitation proceeding.
*   **A.M. No. 00-8-10-SC:** Clarifies that a petition for rehabilitation is a special proceeding, not a civil action.
*   **Premium Marble Resources, Inc. v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 96551):** Rombe's reliance on this case regarding corporate authority was deemed misplaced by the Supreme Court.
*   **Iglesia ni Cristo v. Ponferrada (G.R. No. 168943):**  Cited regarding the sufficiency of verification of pleadings by a party with sufficient knowledge of the facts.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Foreclosure:** The underlying issue of the validity of the foreclosure, including any claims of unilateral interest rate increases, remains unresolved and will be litigated in the annulment case.
*   **Financial Status:** Rombe's history of misrepresenting its financial status in the rehabilitation petition raises concerns about its ability to satisfy its obligations to Asiatrust.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Rombe:** Must now litigate the merits of its annulment claim in the RTC, Branch 15.
*   **Asiatrust:** Subject to the ongoing litigation regarding the validity of the foreclosure proceedings.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA, finding that the injunction against foreclosure did not improperly interfere with the prior dismissal of the rehabilitation petition. The annulment case will proceed in the RTC. The key legal distinction highlighted is the difference between a special proceeding (rehabilitation) and a civil action (annulment of foreclosure). The risk lies in whether the foreclosure will be determined to be valid or not, dependent on Rombeâ€™s claims of errors and violations by Asiatrust.
