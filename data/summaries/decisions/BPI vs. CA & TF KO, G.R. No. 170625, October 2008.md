**Legal Document Summary: BPI vs. Court of Appeals and TF KO Development Corporation (G.R. No. 170625)**

**Type:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA resolutions and RTC decision approving TF KO Development Corp.'s rehabilitation plan.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RTC Decision:** Approved TF KO Development Corporation's rehabilitation plan, directing it to pursue its housing development project, establishing a payment schedule for creditors BPI and Landbank, discharging Metrobank from the rehabilitation plan (to be settled personally by Mrs. Flora Ko), prohibiting dividend declarations, and discharging the Rehabilitation Receiver.
*   **Payment Schedule:** The rehabilitation plan outlines a semi-annual payment schedule for BPI and Landbank, with a 12% annual interest rate compounded annually. BPI is scheduled to receive Php 5,584,775.00 every six months for eight periods starting 6.30.05 until 12.31.08; Land Bank is scheduled to receive Php 5,153,150.00 every six months for eight periods starting 6.30.05 until 12.31.08.
*   **Stay Order:** Initially issued by the RTC prohibiting enforcement of claims against TF KO; later terminated by the RTC's decision approving the rehabilitation plan.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **BPI's Loss of Control:** The approved rehabilitation plan significantly impairs BPI's contractual rights and control over its loan agreement with TF KO Development Corporation. BPI is bound by the imposed payment schedule.
*   **Feasibility of Rehabilitation Plan:** BPI argues the plan is not viable and the alleged success is purely conjectural. The housing market is unpredictable, and the corporation's ability to generate sufficient income to meet the payment schedule is uncertain.
*   **Compliance with Payment Schedule:** The success of the rehabilitation plan depends on the debtor's ability to comply with the prescribed payment schedule. Failure to meet the schedule could result in further legal action and potential liquidation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** This governs the petition for review on certiorari.
*   **Interim Rules on Corporate Rehabilitation:** Specifically Section 1, Rule 4 is questioned by the petitioner and its applicability.
*   **Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, Section 6 and 11:** Governs appeals from the RTC to the Court of Appeals, emphasizing the content of the petition and elevation of the case records.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 22, Sec. 1:** Addresses the issue of late filing of the petition.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 13, Sec. 3:** Addresses the issue of the filing by registered mail, and the date of mailing.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Viability of the Rehabilitation Plan:** BPI contests the factual and legal basis for the approval of the rehabilitation plan, alleging that its success is purely conjectural.
*   **Interest Rate and Compounding:** While a 12% annual interest rate is specified, the precise method of compounding (e.g., simple, annually) could lead to disputes if not clearly defined.
*   **Discharge of Metrobank:** The decision to discharge Metrobank and place responsibility on Mrs. Ko is unusual and may raise questions about the fairness and impact on other creditors.

**Procedural Issues:**

*   **Late Filing (Ruled in Favor of BPI by Supreme Court):** The CA initially dismissed the petition as filed beyond the extended period.
*   **Non-Compliance with Rules of Court (Ruled in Favor of BPI by Supreme Court):** The Court of Appeals alleged non-compliance with procedural requirements concerning verification, certification against forum shopping, and submission of necessary documents.
*   **Lack of Certification Against Forum Shopping (Rectified):** Though initial failure to present proof of authority to sign.

**Supreme Court Decision:**

*   Partially granted the petition for review on certiorari.
*   Set aside the Court of Appeals' resolutions dismissing outright the petition for review and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings and disposition of the appeal on its merits. The Supreme Court found that the procedural lapses cited by the appellate court were either not supported by the records or would not have warranted the outright dismissal of the case.
