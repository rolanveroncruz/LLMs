## Legal Document Summary: *Albay Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. Hon. Rafael P. Santelices, 603 Phil. 104 (G.R. No. 132540, April 16, 2009)*

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing RTC Orders in Civil Case No. 9441 (Damages due to Illegal Electric Disconnection and Extortion).

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Albay Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ALECO), Edgardo A. San Pablo, Evan Calleja
*   **Respondents:** Hon. Rafael P. Santelices (RTC Judge), Mayon International Hotel, Inc. (MIH)

**Background:** MIH sued ALECO for damages, alleging illegal disconnection and extortion. ALECO counters that MIH tampered with its electrical connections to avoid payment.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **Improper Raffle/Assignment of Case:** ALECO argues Judge Santelices violated Administrative Circular No. 20-95 by assigning the case to his branch without proper notice and raffle. *Statutory Reference: Administrative Circular No. 20-95*

2.  **Premature Setting of Pre-Trial:** ALECO contends the pre-trial conference was set prematurely by Judge Santelices before MIH filed a motion or the period for filing the last pleading had expired, violating Section 1, Rule 18 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. *Statutory Reference: Section 1, Rule 18 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure*

3.  **Order to Reimburse Opposing Counsel's Expenses:** ALECO challenges the RTC Order requiring them to reimburse MIH's counsel's (Atty. Balicanta) travel expenses and appearance fee due to a last-minute cancellation of the pre-trial conference. ALECO's original counsel withdrew, leaving them unprepared.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Original RTC Order:** ALECO was ordered to pay MIH's counsel P2,500 (transportation) and P3,000 (appearance fee).
*   **Final CA Decision (CA-G.R. CV No. 68491):** While the RTC initially ruled in favor of ALECO, the Court of Appeals (CA) modified the decision, reducing the actual damages awarded to ALECO from MIH to P1,454,381.50 and deleting the awards of moral and exemplary damages as well as attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The crux of ALECO's argument relies on alleged procedural irregularities by the trial court, which were viewed with disfavor by the Court of Appeals.
*   The propriety of using certiorari to challenge interlocutory orders is questioned. The standard for certiorari requires a showing of lack of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.
*   The CA's focus on errors of law rather than jurisdictional errors highlights the risk that certiorari is an inappropriate remedy.
*   MIH's potential liability for actual damages was significantly reduced by the Court of Appeals, indicating an unfavourable outcome for ALECO regarding these damages.
*   **Waiver:** MIH's manifestation waiving its claim to the transportation and appearance fees could potentially bind them, precluding any future attempts to collect these amounts, and Article 6 of the Civil Code dictates the limits of this waiver. *Statutory Reference: Article 6 of the Civil Code*

**Case Law/Principles Invoked:**

*   **Certiorari:** Defined and limited to correcting errors of jurisdiction, not errors of law or procedure. *Case Law: Lee v. People, 441 Phil. 705 (2002)*
*   **Interlocutory Orders:** General disinclination to review via certiorari; remedy is to appeal the final judgment. *Case Law: Angara v. Fedman Development Corporation, G.R. No. 156822 (2004)*
*   **Hierarchy of Courts:** Litigants should seek relief from lower courts before resorting to the Supreme Court. *Case Law: Paradero v. Abragan, 468 Phil. 277 (2004)*
*   **Mootness:** Courts do not decide abstract questions where no practical relief can be granted. *Case Law: Republic v. Tan, G.R. No. 145255 (2004)*
*   **Waiver:** Rights can be waived unless contrary to law, public order, etc. *Case Law: National Food Authority v. Court of Appeals, 370 Phil. 735 (1999)*

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court dismissed ALECO's Petition for Certiorari, deeming the issues moot and academic due to the final and executory CA Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 68491 and MIH's waiver of claims under the challenged RTC Orders.

**Legal Precision Notes:**

*   The summary retains legally significant terms (certiorari, interlocutory orders, moot and academic, etc.).
*   Statutory and case law references are included for ease of further research.
*   The summary highlights potential liabilities and areas of legal ambiguity (e.g., the validity and effect of MIH's waiver).
