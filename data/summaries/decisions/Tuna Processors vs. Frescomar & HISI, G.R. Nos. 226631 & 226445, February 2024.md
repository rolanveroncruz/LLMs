**Case:** *Tuna Processors, Inc. v. Frescomar Corporation & Hawaii International Seafoods, Inc. (HISI)*, G.R. No. 226445/226631, February 27, 2024

**Summary:** The Supreme Court (SC) ruled that Frescomar's production of filtered smoke did not infringe Tuna Processors, Inc. (TPI)'s Yamaoka Patent (Philippine Patent No. 31138, "Method for Curing Fish and Meat by Extra Low Temperature Smoking") because Frescomar's process did not complete all elements of the claim, especially related to tuna processing. However, the SC found Hawaii International Seafoods, Inc. (HISI) liable for tortious interference for inducing Frescomar to breach its license agreement with TPI by advising them not to pay royalties. The SC awarded temperate damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees to TPI.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Patent Infringement (Direct):** The SC emphasized the importance of patent claims in determining infringement, citing *Phillips Seafood Philippines Corporation v. Tuna Processors, Inc.* (same Yamaoka patent). Found no direct infringement by Frescomar because it only produced filtered smoke, which, by itself, does not constitute the complete curing process defined in Claim 1 of the Yamaoka Patent (burning, filtering, cooling, smoking tuna meat). The smoke machine used by Frescomar was considered prior art because it was disclosed in the patent description but not protected in the claims.
*   **Patent Infringement (Indirect/Contributory):** HISI not liable for indirect patent infringement, because Frescomar was not a direct infringer. Lack of evidence that the smoke can only be used in the patented process.
*   **Settlement Agreement:** TPI's Settlement Agreement with Frescomar, and Joint Motion to Dismiss, effectively released Frescomar from liability for past infringement, even if it occurred.
*   **Tortious Interference:** HISI liable for tortious interference under Article 1314 of the Civil Code. The elements laid down in *So Ping Bun v. Court of Appeals* were met: valid contract (license agreement), HISI's knowledge of the contract, and HISI's unjustified interference (ordering Frescomar not to pay royalties to weaken TPI's position in a U.S. patent infringement case). *Lagon v. Court of Appeals* was cited regarding the requirement of malice or wrongful motive.
*   **Damages:**
    *   **Temperate Damages:** SC awarded PHP 1,000,000.00 as temperate damages, modified from the CA's award, citing lack of definitive proof of actual damages but recognizing a pecuniary loss to TPI.
    *   **Exemplary Damages:** SC awarded PHP 500,000.00 as exemplary damages to deter future tortious interference, citing *Go v. Cordero*.
    *   **Attorney's Fees:** SC upheld PHP 1,000,000.00 in attorney's fees under Article 2208(1) and (4) of the Civil Code due to HISI's malice.
    *   **Moral Damages:** CA's deletion of moral damages upheld, because the proximate cause of TPI's injury was the filing of the unfair competition case, not the tortious interference itself.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Scope of the Yamaoka Patent:** The decision underscores the critical importance of precise claim drafting in patent applications. Ambiguity in the claims could lead to difficulty in enforcement.
*   **Defining Indirect Infringement:** Establishing the specific intent and knowledge elements required for indirect infringement remains challenging.
*   **Causation in Tortious Interference:** Proving the causal link between the interference and the damages suffered can be difficult.
*   **Valuation of Damages:** The absence of clear financial records made proving actual damages for tortious interference challenging, leading to reliance on temperate damages which are discretionary.
