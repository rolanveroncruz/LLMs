## Legal Document Summary: *Co Tuan, et al. vs. NLRC and CLUP* (G.R. No. 117232, April 22, 1998)

**Nature:** Special civil action for Certiorari and Prohibition challenging the jurisdiction of the NLRC.

**Key Issue:** Whether the NLRC has jurisdiction to rule on the validity of a sale between petitioners (Co Tuan, et al.) and Buda Enterprises, and to determine if such sale was fraudulent to evade Buda Enterprises' debt to the private respondent Union (CLUP) arising from an unfair labor practice judgment.

**Background:**

*   CLUP won a labor case against Buda Enterprises, resulting in a final and executory judgment.
*   A writ of execution was issued, leading to the levy of properties allegedly belonging to Buda Enterprises but registered under the petitioners' names.
*   Petitioners filed an Urgent Motion to Quash the Writ, asserting ownership through a prior "Extra-judicial Settlement and Sale" from the heirs of Edilberto Soriano (including Lourdes Soriano, proprietress of Buda Enterprises).
*   NLRC ordered the Labor Arbiter to implead the petitioners and determine if the sale was to evade payment to the Union.
*   Petitioners argue the NLRC lacks jurisdiction to determine the validity of the sale, citing *Asian Footwear vs. Soriano*.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioners' Argument:** NLRC's competence extends only to properties "unquestionably" belonging to the judgment debtor (*Santos vs. Bayhon*). Determining fraud in the sale is a judicial function beyond NLRC's scope (*Asian Footwear vs. Soriano*).
*   **Private Respondent's Argument:** NLRC authority arises from Section 2, Rule VI of the NLRC Manual of Instructions for Sheriffs, allowing it to resolve third-party claims. Petitioners are estopped from challenging jurisdiction due to their initial Motion to Quash.
*   **NLRC's Argument:** Petition is premature due to the lack of a Motion for Reconsideration.
*   **Solicitor General's Argument:** NLRC erred in ordering a hearing to prove a commitment to pay Union claims from the sale proceeds, as this wouldn't bind the petitioners. The NLRC Manual provision is limited to determining if the sheriff acted correctly.

**Court Ruling:**

*   Petition granted. NLRC decision reversed and set aside.
*   The Court held that determining the validity of the sale, especially concerning potential fraud, is a judicial function beyond the NLRC's competence, citing *Asian Footwear vs. Soriano*.
*   NLRC Manual provision (Section 2, Rule VI) applies only when the third-party claimant chooses to file his claim with the Labor Arbiter or the NLRC.
*   Third-party claimants have the option to file a separate action to vindicate their claim (*Ong vs. Tating*).
*   The Court rejected NLRC's prematurity argument, noting the issue was already heard. Estoppel argument was rejected, stating motion to quash was to question NLRCâ€™s jurisdiction.

**Obligations:**

*   Buda Enterprises: Obligation to pay the monetary judgment to CLUP from the labor case, subject to execution.
*   Petitioners: No obligation to pay Union claims.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability of Buda Enterprises (or its owner) for fraudulent conveyance if a separate action is brought and proves fraud.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Fraudulent Conveyance:** The possibility of a separate action for fraudulent conveyance to nullify the sale and subject the properties to execution for the benefit of CLUP.
*   **Third Party Claim:** The Union could still pursue a separate judicial action asserting that the "Extra-judicial Settlement and Sale" was fraudulent, and that the sale to the Petitioners was intended to avoid payment of the debt.
