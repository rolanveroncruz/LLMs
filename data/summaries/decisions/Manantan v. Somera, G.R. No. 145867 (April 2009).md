## Legal Document Summary: *Estate of Soledad Manantan v. Aniceto Somera* (G.R. No. 145867)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the Court of Appeals' decision dismissing an ejectment complaint filed by Soledad Manantan (now represented by her estate) against Aniceto Somera.

**Key Issue:**  Jurisdiction of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) over the ejectment action.  Specifically, whether the complaint properly alleged facts constitutive of *unlawful detainer* under Rule 70, Section 1 of the Rules of Court.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling that the MTCC lacked jurisdiction because the complaint failed to sufficiently allege facts constituting unlawful detainer. The allegations did not establish a prior contractual relationship or compliance with the one-year prescriptive period from the last demand to vacate.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Unlawful Detainer (Rule 70, Section 1, Rules of Court):** The Court emphasized that an unlawful detainer action requires proof of:
    *   Prior lawful possession by the defendant by virtue of an express or implied contract with the plaintiff.
    *   Termination or expiration of the right to possess.
    *   Demand to vacate the premises.
    *   Unlawful withholding of possession after the demand.
    *   Filing of the complaint within one year from the last demand.
*   **Jurisdictional Allegations:** The Court reiterated the well-settled principle that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint. The complaint *must* contain sufficient facts showing that the action is indeed for unlawful detainer. The court cannot rely on parol evidence to establish jurisdiction if the complaint is deficient. *Laresma v. Abellana* (G.R. No. 140973) was cited, reiterating that lack of jurisdiction cannot be cured by consent or waiver.
*   **Complaint Deficiencies:**  The Court found that the complaint lacked key allegations, specifically the date of the last demand to vacate. This omission was fatal because it prevented the court from determining whether the action was filed within the one-year prescriptive period for unlawful detainer.
*   **Potential Alternative Remedies:** The Court suggested that the plaintiff's cause of action may lie in either *accion publiciana* or *accion reivindicatoria*, both of which fall under the jurisdiction of the RTC. These remedies were not discussed in detail.

**Obligations:**

*   The Estate of Soledad Manantan has no recourse under an action for unlawful detainer.
*   Respondent Aniceto Somera retains possession of the disputed portions, subject to any further action by the Estate to recover ownership or possession in the proper court.

**Liabilities:**

*   No monetary liabilities were assessed due to the dismissal of the action.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Prescription:** The passage of time may further complicate the pursuit of *accion publiciana* or *accion reivindicatoria*. The Estate must act promptly to determine if these alternative actions remain viable.
*   **Defense of Good Faith:** If the Estate files an *accion reivindicatoria*, the issue of whether Somera is a builder in good faith may be raised, potentially impacting the remedies available to the Estate (e.g., requiring payment for improvements).
*   **Proof of Ownership:** The Estate must be prepared to present sufficient evidence of Soledad Manantan's ownership and the boundaries of the property in any future action, as the initial ejectment complaint was not decided on the merits.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The description of the property boundaries in the TCT and its relation to the "disputed portions" occupied by Somera may be contentious.
*   The nature and extent of Somera's improvements and "driveway/access road" on the disputed portion and its impact on the remedies may prove contentious.
