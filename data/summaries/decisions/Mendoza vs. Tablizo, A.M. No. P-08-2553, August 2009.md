**Case Summary: Mendoza v. Tablizo, A.M. No. P-08-2553**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Prospero V. Tablizo, Clerk of Court VI and Ex-Officio Sheriff, for grave misconduct, misfeasance, malfeasance, and incompetence.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Allegations:** Complainant Mendoza alleged that Tablizo:
    *   Improperly canceled an extrajudicial foreclosure sale without notice to Mendoza or the Executive Judge.
    *   Refused to accept a second petition for extrajudicial foreclosure.
    *   Violated Administrative Order No. 3, Series of 1984 (direct supervision by Executive Judge; ministerial duties of Clerk of Court in extrajudicial foreclosures).
    *   Ignored Central Bank Circular No. 905 regarding freedom to contract interest rates.
*   **Respondent's Non-Compliance:** Tablizo failed to file a comment despite multiple orders from the Court.
*   **Procedural History:** Case initially investigated by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), which recommended forfeiture of benefits. The Court initially withheld a portion of retirement benefits and referred the case back to the OCA.
*   **OCA Findings:** Tablizo waived his right to defend himself, implying admission of the charges.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Administrative Order No. 3, Series of 1984:** Requires the Clerk of Court/Ex-Officio Sheriff to perform specific ministerial duties in extrajudicial foreclosures, including:
    *   Docketing applications
    *   Collecting fees
    *   Examining requirements before the auction
    *   Issuing certificates of sale
    *   Following the procedures for auction sales.
*   **Duty to Respond:** Court personnel have a duty to respond to administrative complaints to preserve the integrity of the judiciary.
*   **Standards of Conduct:** Sheriffs, as court employees, must maintain propriety and decorum, avoiding suspicion.

**Liabilities/Penalties:**

*   **Finding of Guilt:** Tablizo was found guilty of grave misconduct, incompetence, malfeasance, and misfeasance.
*   **Forfeiture of Benefits:** Retirement benefits (excluding accrued terminal leave benefits) were forfeited.
*   **Bar to Re-employment:** Tablizo is barred from re-employment in any government branch, agency, or instrumentality.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Implied Admission:** The Court heavily relies on Tablizo's silence as an implied admission of guilt. Arguments could be made regarding whether this inference is justified or whether the Court should have sought further investigation.
*   **Lack of Specific Factual Findings:** The decision lacks detailed analysis of the specific actions Tablizo took (or failed to take) concerning the second foreclosure petition. While the docketing number raises suspicion, it's not conclusive proof of wrongdoing.
*   **Cumulative Sanctions:** The decision mentions prior administrative offenses by Tablizo. This highlights the importance of consistent application of disciplinary measures and may have influenced the severity of the penalty in this case.
*   **Central Bank Circular 905**While mentioned in the allegations, the document does not analyze this claim substantively.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135:** Law governing extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **Act No. 4118:** Amendment to Act No. 3135.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1709, Sec. 1,4:** Publication requirements for auction sale notices.
*   **Administrative Order No. 3, Series of 1984:** Sets the procedure to be followed in extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgages. This is the core regulation violated.
*   **Central Bank Circular No. 905** Leaves to the discretion of the lender and the borrower the interest rate to be charged.
*   **Tagaloguin v. Hingco, Jr. (A.M. No. P-05-2008):** Emphasizes the high standards of conduct expected of judiciary employees.
*   **Martinez v. Zoleta (A.M. No. MTJ-94-904):** Obligation of court personnel to comment on accusations.
*   **Himalin v. Balderian (A.M. No. MTJ-03-1504):** The power of the court to exercise administrative supervision over courts and personnel.

**Legal Precision Notes:**

*   The cancellation of the first sale is a crucial point. The decision should be reviewed for specific procedures surrounding cancellation and the requirement (or lack thereof) for notice to the mortgagor/mortgagee.
*   The ambiguity surrounding the handling of the second foreclosure petition needs further scrutiny. Consider whether the Clerk of Court's office followed standard procedures and if there is an established paper trail. The mere notation of a docket number, even with the lack of the receiving stamp date, might be insufficient to prove misconduct.
*   The decision hinges significantly on the "implied admission" argument. Research case law on the validity and limitations of drawing adverse inferences from silence in administrative proceedings.
