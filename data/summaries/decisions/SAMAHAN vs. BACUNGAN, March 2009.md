## Legal Document Summary: *Samahan ng mga Manggagawa sa Hyatt v. Bacungan and Hyatt Regency Manila* (G.R. No. 149050)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a petition for certiorari challenging a Voluntary Arbitrator's decision.

**Key Issue:** Proper recourse to assail a decision of a Voluntary Arbitrator: Rule 43 (Petition for Review) or Rule 65 (Certiorari) of the Rules of Court. Relatedly, the employment status of specific individuals (Dacles, Valencia, Dalmacio, and Dazo) at Hyatt Regency Manila.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Appeal of Voluntary Arbitrator Decisions:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirms the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, holding that the correct remedy to appeal a Voluntary Arbitrator's decision is a Petition for Review under Rule 43, as established in *Luzon Development Bank v. Association of Luzon Development Bank Employees* (319 Phil. 262 (1995)).
*   **Rejection of Certiorari:** The SC explicitly rejects the petitioner union's argument that certiorari under Rule 65 is the proper remedy. Erroneous mode of appeal is cause for dismissal of the petition. *Nippon Paint Employees Union-Olalia v. Court of Appeals*.
*   **Timeliness:** Petition was dismissed by the CA because the petition was filed outside the fifteen-day reglementary period for filing a petition for review under Rule 43.
*   **Employment Status:**
    *   **Dacles & Valencia:** Upheld Voluntary Arbitrator's finding that Dacles and Valencia are employees of City Service Corporation (CSC), an independent contractor, not Hyatt. Their employment may be terminated upon the expiration of the contract for cleaning services between CSC and respondent Hyatt.
    *   **Dalmacio & Dazo:** Upheld Voluntary Arbitrator's finding that Dalmacio and Dazo are project employees of Hyatt, whose employment may be terminated only upon the closure of the flower shop.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioner (Union): To comply with the Rules of Court regarding proper appellate procedure.
*   Respondent (Hyatt): To adhere to the terms of employment contracts with Dalmacio and Dazo.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner (Union): Liable for costs.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Future Closure of Flower Shop:** The continued employment of Dalmacio and Dazo is contingent upon the flower shop remaining open.
*   **Independent Contractor vs. Labor-Only Contracting:** The finding that CSC is an independent contractor is crucial. Had evidence demonstrated "labor-only contracting," Hyatt may have been deemed the employer of Dacles and Valencia.
*   **Reliance on *Luzon Development Bank*:** The decision heavily relies on *Luzon Development Bank* which some argue is inconsistent with the literal interpretation of Section 2, Rule 43.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Rule 43 and Rule 65, Rules of Court
*   Section 9, Batas Pambansa Blg. 129
*   *Luzon Development Bank v. Association of Luzon Development Bank Employees* (319 Phil. 262 (1995))

*   *Nippon Paint Employees Union v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 159010, 19 November 2004, 443 SCRA 286)

**Contentious Clauses/Areas:**

*   The distinction between independent contracting and labor-only contracting.
