**Case Summary: *Hon. Moises M. Pardo v. Lugeorge N. Discipulo*, A.M. No. HOJ-07-01 (June 12, 2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative complaints for dishonesty and gross misconduct. Judge Pardo charged Electrician Discipulo with falsifying his time card and security logbook entries. Discipulo counter-complained against Judge Pardo for gross misconduct.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Discipulo's Dishonesty:** The Court found Discipulo guilty of dishonesty for inserting false departure times on his time card and the security logbook after failing to punch out. This violates OCA Circular No. 7-2003 and jurisprudence (e.g., *Garcia v. Bada*, *Servino v. Adolfo*) requiring truthful timekeeping.
*   **Falsification Act:** Discipulo borrowed the logbook and made insertions without the guards' permission. This act was seen as intentional deception to make his time card match the logbook.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Cites *Pan v. Salamat* regarding the burden of proof in administrative cases.
*   **Penalty:** Discipulo was suspended for six months, citing *Re: Failure of Jose Dante E. Guerrero* as precedent for similar penalties for time record falsification.
*   **Dismissal of Charges Against Judge Pardo:** The Court dismissed the charges against Judge Pardo due to lack of substantial evidence to support Discipulo's allegations of gross misconduct.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Garcia v. Bada, A.M. No. P-07-2311, 23 August 2007, 530 SCRA 779, 783:** Reinforces the obligation of court employees to comply with timekeeping rules.
*   **Servino v. Adolfo , A.M. No. P-06-2204, 30 November 2006, 509 SCRA 42, 52:**  Same as above.
*   **Duque v. Aspiras, A.M. No. P-05-2036, 15 July 2005, 463 SCRA 447, 454:** Holds employees liable for irregularities in time records.
*   **Re: Failure of Jose Dante E. Guerrero to Register His Time In and Out in Chronolog Time Recorder Machine on Several Dates, A.M. No. 2005-07-SC, 19 April 2006, 487 SCRA 352, 369:** Similar case involving falsification of time records.

**Statutory/Circular References:**

*   **OCA Circular No. 7-2003:** Mandates accurate timekeeping by court personnel.

**Obligations:**

*   Judicial employees have a duty to devote official time to government service (referencing *Concerned Litigants v. Araya, Jr.*).
*   Judicial employees are required to follow the clear mandate of OCA Circular No. 7-2003.

**Liabilities:**

*   Discipulo held liable for dishonesty due to the deliberate falsification of his time card.
*   Falsification of time records constitutes dishonesty, as illustrated by *Gillamac-Ortiz v. Almeida, Jr.*

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The court gave greater weight to the security guards' testimony over other court employees due to potential bias (specifically noting Tuldague's hostility toward Judge Pardo). This highlights the importance of witness impartiality.
*   **Substantial Evidence:** The court emphasizes that the complainant must prove their allegations by 'substantial evidence.'
*   **Ambiguity and intent:** The investigation focused on Discipulo's intent when making the changes to the logbook. His explanation was deemed implausible given the sequence of events.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the suspension of Discipulo, an Electrician II, for dishonesty related to falsifying his time card and logbook. His actions violated established rules on timekeeping. The Court dismissed Discipulo's counter-complaint against Judge Pardo for lack of supporting evidence. This case emphasizes the importance of honesty and accurate record-keeping within the judicial system.
