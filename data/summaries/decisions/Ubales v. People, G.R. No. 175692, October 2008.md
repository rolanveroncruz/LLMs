## Legal Document Summary - *Ubales v. People* (G.R. No. 175692)

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and acquitted Angel Ubales of homicide due to reasonable doubt. The case concerns the death of Mark Santos, who died from a gunshot wound to the head. The prosecution's primary evidence relied on the testimony of an eyewitness, Eduardo Galvan, who claimed to have seen Ubales shoot Santos.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Homicide (Article 249, Revised Penal Code)
*   **Alleged Weapon:** .38 caliber *paltik* (homemade) revolver
*   **Prosecution's Key Witness:** Eduardo Galvan, a *balut* vendor and friend of the deceased.
*   **Circumstances:** An argument occurred earlier in the evening between Ubales and Santos. Galvan testified to witnessing the shooting.
*   **Defense:** Alibi - Ubales claims he was with friends at a different location at the time of the shooting.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The burden of proof rested on the prosecution to prove Ubales' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court found they failed to meet this burden.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities (Prior to Supreme Court Ruling):**

*   Criminal conviction for homicide.
*   Imprisonment (prior CA ruling upheld RTC sentence: 10 years *prision mayor* to 14 years, 8 months, and 1 day *reclusion temporal*).
*   Civil liability for damages (prior CA ruling upheld RTC award of P50,000 civil indemnity and P50,000 moral damages, plus P8,000 actual damages, and added P25,000 temperate damages).

**Key Legal Issues & Analysis:**

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The core issue revolves around the credibility and reliability of the eyewitness testimony of Eduardo Galvan.
*   **Credibility of Witness Testimony:** The Supreme Court found Galvan's testimony improbable and inconsistent with common experience. Key points of contention include:
    *   Galvan's reason for stopping and remaining a meter away from a quarrel at 3 AM.
    *   The lack of acknowledgment of Galvan's presence by either Ubales or Santos during the alleged altercation.
    *   Galvan's failure to immediately assist his "best friend" after the shooting.
    *   Inconsistencies and lack of knowledge about locations and people involved.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The lack of ballistic examination linking the recovered gun to the fatal bullet weakened the prosecution's case.  The Court highlighted the principle that motive is essential when evidence is circumstantial.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Court reiterated that the prosecution bears the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and cannot rely on the weakness of the defense's alibi. *People v. Tabayoyong, 192 Phil. 234, 256-257 (1981)*. The prosecution must prove each element of the crime.
*   **Reasonable Doubt:** The Court emphasized that an acquittal is warranted when the evidence admits of two interpretations, one consistent with guilt and the other with innocence. *People v. Mijares, 358 Phil. 154, 166 (1998)*. The accused is to be given the benefit of the doubt.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 249 (Homicide)

*   *People v. Tabayoyong, 192 Phil. 234, 256-257 (1981)* (on the burden of proof)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Aspects:**

*   The primary point of contention is the veracity and reliability of the single eyewitness's account. The Supreme Court clearly expressed skepticism regarding Galvan's testimony.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and acquitted Angel Ubales of homicide due to reasonable doubt.
