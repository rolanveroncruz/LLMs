**Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC)*, G.R. No. 110656, September 3, 1998**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing the NLRC decision affirming the Labor Arbiter's decision.

**Key Issue:** Whether salary increases mandated by Republic Act No. 6640 (RA 6640) are permanent additions to an employee's salary, unaffected by subsequent promotional increases.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the NLRC decision. RA 6640's wage increases are not creditable against promotional increases and cannot be considered temporary.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 6640, Section 2:** Mandates a daily wage increase, interpreted by the Labor Arbiter and the Court to be *in addition to* existing salaries and benefits.
*   **RA 6640, Section 7:** Prohibits the diminution of existing benefits and allowances.
*   **PAL Obligation:** To integrate the P304.00 wage increase under RA 6640 into the monthly salary of the covered employees.
*   **PAL Obligation:** To pay salary differentials from the date of the withdrawal of the increase.
*   **PAL Obligation:** To pay 10% of the total award as attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   PAL is liable for salary differentials resulting from its failure to include the RA 6640 increase post-promotion.
*   PAL is liable for attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The ruling solidifies the precedent that statutory wage increases are cumulative and not creditable against promotional increases, potentially creating future liabilities for employers who similarly attempt to offset mandated increases.
*   The denial of PAL's argument could lead to a larger overall wage bill, impacting profitability.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6640:** The central statute, particularly Sections 2, 3, and 7. The core dispute centers on the interpretation of Section 2's impact on employee wages after promotions. Section 7 expressly forbids the reduction of existing benefits due to the law.
*   **Apex Mining Company, Inc. v. NLRC, 206 SCRA 497:** Distinguishes this case. Apex Mining was allowed to credit CBA wage increases as compliance with Wage Orders Nos. 5 and 6 due to the presence of a crediting provision in said orders which is absent in RA 6640.
*   **Paras v. Commission on Elections, 264 SCRA 323:** Relates to statutory interpretation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The underscored proviso in Section 2. PAL argued it was a wage distortion mechanism, which the court rejected.
*   PAL's argument that RA 6640's benefit was "temporary," which was dismissed by the NLRC and the Court.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Court adopted a strict interpretation of RA 6640, emphasizing the absence of a creditability provision and the prohibition against diminishing existing benefits. This approach is consistent with the principle of construing labor laws liberally in favor of labor. PAL's attempt to treat promotional increases as compliance with RA 6640 was rejected. This is largely because the Court interpreted the RA 6640 to exist independently of other wage increases. The Court held that the NLRC was essentially saying that it lacked jurisdiction *to rule in favor of the Petitioner*, not that it lacked jurisdiction over the issue at hand.
