## Legal Document Summary: *People vs. Malicsi*, G.R. No. 175833

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming with modification the RTC conviction of Edwin Malicsi for four counts of rape.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision finding Malicsi guilty of four counts of *simple* rape (instead of qualified rape).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charges:** Four counts of rape against AAA, a minor (13-15 years old) at the time of the incidents.
*   **Defense:** Consensual sexual intercourse; "sweetheart" relationship.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Testimony of AAA, her mother, and the examining physician (Dr. dela Rosa). Medical certificate indicated old hymenal lacerations.
*   **Court Findings:**
    *   Rejected the "sweetheart" defense due to lack of corroborating evidence and the age difference/moral ascendancy.
    *   Found AAA credible, despite delay in reporting, due to death threats and her immaturity, and found no ill motive to lie.
    *   Acknowledged the relationship (uncle/niece by affinity) but found the information was improperly plead.
    *   Moral damages are automatically granted to the victim without presentation of further proof other than the commission of the crime

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant (Malicsi):** Found guilty of four counts of simple rape.  Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*. Liable for ₱200,000.00 as civil indemnity (₱50,000 for each count) and ₱200,000.00 in moral damages (₱50,000 for each count).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Improper Allegation of Relationship:** The key issue leading to the downgrade from qualified to simple rape was the *improper allegation* of the family relationship in the Information.  The Informations only state that he is the "uncle" of AAA. This is not the sufficient allegation required by law because the Information must allege that he is a relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree and the same should be proven during the trial. While the relationship was proven, it wasn't properly *pleaded*. This highlights the importance of precise pleading standards.
*   **Reliance on Victim's Testimony:** The case heavily relies on the victim's testimony. Challenges to her credibility (delay, lack of outcry) were addressed by the court. The decision emphasizes that there is no "standard" way to react.
*   **Affirmative Defense Burden:** The appellant failed to discharge the burden of proving the affirmative defense of consent by clear and convincing evidence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9346:** *An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines*. This resulted in the reduction of the sentence to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **People v. Garcia:** Used to support the finding of intimidation, including moral intimidation, as constituting rape.
*   **People v. Sabredo & Abala:** Cited regarding the requirement that the qualifying circumstance of relationship must be properly alleged in the Information.
* **People v. Dizon** Cited regarding Moral damages are automatically granted to the rape victim without presentation of further proof other than the commission of the crime.
* **People v. Biong & Molleda** Cited regarding Civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000 for each count of simple rape is automatically granted once the fact of rape is established.
