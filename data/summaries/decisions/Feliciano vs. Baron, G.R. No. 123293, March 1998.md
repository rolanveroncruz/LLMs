**Case Summary: *Feliciano v. Court of Appeals and Baron***

**Citation:** 350 Phil. 499 (G.R. No. 123293, March 05, 1998)

**Core Issue:** Whether an action for annulment of a mortgage and subsequent foreclosure sale (RTC case) constitutes *litis pendentia* barring a subsequent ejectment suit (MeTC case) filed by the purchaser of the foreclosed property. Additionally, whether the ejectment complaint sufficiently established a cause of action for unlawful detainer.

**Facts:**

*   Eleuterio Cosme obtained a loan from Insular Bank, secured by a mortgage on land registered in his name.
*   Cosme defaulted, the bank extrajudicially foreclosed, and became the owner.
*   After Cosme and his wife died, their daughters (including Petitioner Feliciano) took possession.
*   Feliciano filed an RTC action against the bank for annulment of the mortgage, foreclosure sale, and reconveyance (Civil Case No. Q-37870).
*   During the RTC case, Respondent Baron purchased the property from the bank and demanded rent/eviction from Feliciano.
*   Baron filed an ejectment suit (unlawful detainer) in the MeTC, which was dismissed based on *litis pendentia*.
*   The RTC affirmed the MeTC decision, also citing lack of jurisdiction due to insufficient allegations for either forcible entry or unlawful detainer.
*   The Court of Appeals reversed, finding no *litis pendentia* and sufficient allegations for unlawful detainer, remanding the ejectment case.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Mortgage & Foreclosure:** Governed by relevant provisions of the Civil Code and Rules of Court on mortgage, foreclosure, and redemption.
*   **Unlawful Detainer:** Action based on Sec. 1, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, requiring prior possession by the plaintiff (or predecessor) and unlawful withholding by the defendant after the expiration or termination of a right to possess. Baron needs to prove the previous owner's (Bank) right to possess the property.
*   **Litis Pendentia (Sec. 1(e), Rule 16, Rules of Court):** Requires (1) identity of parties/interests, (2) identity of rights asserted and reliefs prayed for, and (3) that a judgment in one case would be *res judicata* in the other.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioner (Feliciano):** Risk of eviction if Baron prevails in the ejectment case. However, a successful annulment action in the RTC *could* ultimately affect the ownership and possessory rights, potentially requiring a later action for recovery.
*   **Respondent (Baron):** Risk of losing the ejectment case and the property if Feliciano prevails in the RTC action for annulment.
*   **Bank (Former Owner):** Potential liability for breach of warranty if the mortgage/foreclosure is found invalid, impacting Baron's title.

*   ***Sy v. Court of Appeals***, G.R. No. 95818, 2 August 1991, 200 SCRA 117: The pendency of an annulment action does not bar an ejectment action. Possession action is effective only with respect to possession and not the title or ownership of the property.
*   ***Joven v. Court of Appeals,*** G.R. No. 80739, 20 August 1992, 212 SCRA 700, 712.: Confirms that RTC can validly try the annulment case and the MeTC can try the ejectment case.

*   **Sumulong v. Court of Appeals, 232 SCRA 372:** An allegation that the defendant is unlawfully withholding possession from the plaintiff is deemed sufficient and a complaint for unlawful detainer is sufficient if it alleges that the withholding of possession or the refusal to vacate is unlawful without necessarily employing the terminology of the law.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sufficiency of Unlawful Detainer Allegations:** While the Court found the allegations sufficient, a more detailed pleading outlining the basis for "unlawful" withholding, such as a specific lease agreement or a clear history of permissive possession, would strengthen the case.
*   **Impact of RTC Case on MeTC Case:** While the Court states that the MeTC case can proceed, a successful RTC action annulling the mortgage *would* significantly undermine Baron's claim to possession. The MeTC may need to suspend proceedings pending the RTC decision to avoid conflicting judgments and promote judicial economy.

**Key Holding:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, holding that the RTC case for annulment did not constitute *litis pendentia* to bar the MeTC ejectment action. The Court reiterated that an action for annulment of sale/reconveyance may proceed independently of an action for unlawful detainer involving the same parties and property. The ejectment complaint sufficiently alleged a cause of action for unlawful detainer.

**Advice:** Proceed with the MeTC case, but closely monitor the RTC case. Be prepared to argue for a stay of the MeTC proceedings if the RTC case nears a judgment favorable to Feliciano. Prepare the MeTC case to prove the sale from the Bank to the Respondent (Deed of Absolute Sale) and the Respondents right of possession over the said property based on this transfer of ownership. The best scenario is that the RTC case is not won by Feliciano as the transfer of ownership to the Bank and then to Respondent is a key element in the MTC case and the RTC case could essentially void that element.
