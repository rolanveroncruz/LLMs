## Legal Document Summary: *Nicolas Laynesa and Santos Laynesa v. Paquito and Pacita Uy*, G.R. No. 149553 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision reversing DARAB ruling on a legal redemption case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Background:** Tenants (Laynesas) sought to redeem land sold by previous owner's heir (Cuba, Jr.) to Spouses Uy. The core issue revolves around DARAB jurisdiction given a municipal ordinance reclassifying the agricultural land to industrial.
*   **Tenancy Relationship:** The Laynesas were established tenants of the land prior to the sale to the Uys, thus giving rise to their right of legal redemption under agrarian laws.
*   **Sale:** Cuba, Jr. sold the unregistered land to Pacita Uy via a Deed of Absolute Sale of Unregistered Land for PhP 80,000.
*   **Reclassification Ordinance:** Municipality passed Resolution No. 67/Ordinance No. 28 reclassifying the land from agricultural to industrial.
*   **Consignation:** Laynesas deposited PhP 80,000 with DARAB Clerk of Court as the redemption price.
*   **DARAB Decision:** Initially granted the petition for redemption, ordering conveyance of the land to the Laynesas. Later modified, setting aside the award of damages.
*   **CA Decision:** Reversed DARAB, holding that DARAB lacked jurisdiction because the land was no longer agricultural at the time the complaint was filed (due to the ordinance).

**Obligations:**

*   **Uy Spouses:** Obligated to convey the land to Laynesas upon payment of the redemption price (subject to compliance with RA 7160 and MC 54).
*   **Laynesas:** Obligated to pay the consolidated redemption amount of P60,000.00 for the 2-hectare Riceland.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, DARAB imposed temperate and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's and appearance fees on the Uy Spouses, but these were later DELETED.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdictional Dispute:**  The central conflict lies in the DARAB's jurisdiction. The Uys argued the reclassification stripped DARAB of jurisdiction. The Court held that at the time of commencement of the case, the action pertained to an agrarian reform matter, thereby giving jurisdiction to DARAB under Section 50 of RA 6657. The Court further reasoned that Section 20(e) of RA 7160 clarifies that reclassification of land does not affect DARAB's power.
*   **Validity of Reclassification:** Critical issue revolves around the validity of the municipal ordinance. Court notes that RA 7160 and MC 54 set stringent requirements for land reclassification, which the Uy spouses failed to demonstrate compliance with. This included certifications from DA and DAR, as well as compliance with public hearing requirements.
*   **Damages:** The DARAB initially awarded damages, but this was overturned. Key principle is the requirement for *damnum et injuria* - damage and a legal wrong.
*   **Impact of *Saba v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 77950, 1990) and *Custodio v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 116100, 1996):** The Court used these cases to support their position in setting aside the award for damages.
*   **Applicability of RA 6657:** The document is centered on the enforcement of the agrarian reform law, particularly as it pertains to the scope and authority conferred to DAR under Section 50.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Specifically, Section 4 (Scope) and Section 50 (Quasi-Judicial Powers of the DAR).

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, REVERSED the CA decision, and AFFIRMED the DARAB decision, but DELETED the award of damages and fees. This effectively upholds the tenants' right to redeem the land.
