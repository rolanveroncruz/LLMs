Okay, here's a concise summary of the legal document, tailored for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Apo Fruits Corporation and Hijo Plantation, Inc. vs. The Hon. Court of Appeals and Land Bank of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 164195, April 30, 2008)

**Nature:** Resolution on Motions for Reconsideration following a partially granted Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding just compensation for land expropriated under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Affirmance of RTC Decision (as modified):** The Supreme Court's Third Division initially affirmed the RTC's determination of just compensation (â‚±1,383,179,000.00 or P103.33 per sq meter), interest from the date of taking (December 9, 1996), commissioner's fees, and attorney's fees. The RTC decision ordered DAR and LBP to pay these amounts jointly and severally.
*   **Modification of RTC Decision (interest):** The RTC modified its decision to impose a 12% interest rate per annum from the time the complaint was filed until the finality of the decision. Additionally, a 12% interest rate was to be imposed on the total obligation after the decision became final and executory until payment was satisfied.
*   **Deletion of Interest and Attorney's Fees:** On Motion for Reconsideration, the Third Division deleted the 12% interest and the award of attorney's fees. The case was remanded to the RTC for further hearing on the amount of Commissioner's Fees.
*   **Denial of Referral En Banc:** LBP's motion to refer the case to the Supreme Court en banc was denied. The Third Division held that its rulings did not modify or reverse existing Supreme Court doctrines, specifically citing *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Sps. Banal*, *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada*, and *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Lim*. The Court emphasized that these cases differed factually.
*   **Denial of Second Motion for Reconsideration:** LBP's attempt to file a second motion for reconsideration on just compensation was denied as a prohibited pleading under Rule 52, Section 2 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Finality:** The motions for reconsideration by both LBP and AFC/HPI were denied with finality. The Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) enjoining the execution of the judgment was lifted.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) & Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR):** Joint and several liability for payment of just compensation, commissioner's fees (subject to further RTC hearing), and costs of suit. Must also deduct any initial payments already made to AFC and HPI.
*   **Apo Fruits Corporation (AFC) & Hijo Plantation, Inc. (HPI):** Obligated to pay any docket fee deficiency from the compensation received.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Commissioner's Fees:** The remand for further hearing on commissioner's fees introduces uncertainty and potential for further litigation on the amount.
*   **Finality & Execution:** While the Supreme Court denied the motion for reconsideration, the determination of a fixed amount for commissioner's fees remains, which could give rise to future execution issues.
*   **Statutory Basis:** RA 6657, Sec. 17, is the key statutory framework, along with the Supreme Court's interpretation of "just compensation" in agrarian reform cases. DAR Administrative Order No. 5 is also relevant.
*   **Case Law:** *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Sps. Banal*, *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada*, *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Lim*, and *Firestone Ceramics, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* are cited as relevant, but distinguished.
*   **"Taking" Date:** December 9, 1996, is the established date of taking.

**Key Issues for Further Review:**

*   Review the RTC record to analyze the basis for the initial just compensation determination.
*   Assess the potential arguments and evidence related to the commissioner's fees determination upon remand.
*   Evaluate the risk of further appeals or attempts to delay execution, considering the finality pronouncement.
*   Evaluate the proper basis for computation of commission fees considering it is 2.5% of just compensation PLUS interest. Given the deletion of interests by the court, the basis for its computation needs to be thoroughly evaluated.
*   Evaluate the possibility of filing a motion for clarification as to whether the commissioner's fees is separate and distinct from the costs of the suit.
