## Legal Document Summary: David Lu v. Paterno Lu Ym, Sr., et al. & Luym Development Corp.

**Case:** G.R. Nos. 153690, 157381, 170889 (Consolidated), August 26, 2008

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions assailing CA decisions regarding an intra-corporate dispute within the Luym family and Luym Development Corp. (LLDC).  The central issue revolves around the issuance of LLDC shares, receivership, dissolution, and allegations of fiduciary breach.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Share Issuance:** David Lu et al. (David's group) challenged the issuance of 600,000 LLDC shares to Paterno Lu Ym, Sr. et al. (Lu Ym group) at a purportedly undervalued price, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and seeking nullification of the share issuance.
*   **Receivership:** David's group initially secured a receivership order *pendente lite* over LLDC. The Lu Ym group contested this.
*   **Dissolution:** David's group sought the dissolution of LLDC as a remedy.
*   **Non-Forum Shopping:** Lu Ym group initially challenged the original complaint's compliance with rules on non-forum shopping, arguing insufficient signatures on the certification. This was the basis of the initial CA dismissal.
*   **Docket Fees:** The Lu Ym group contested the sufficiency of docket fees paid by David's group in the original complaint.
*   **Interim Rules for Intra-Corporate Controversies:** The RTC ordered the amendment of pleadings to conform to these rules.
*   **Preliminary Injunction:** The Lu Ym group sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the execution of the RTC's decision annulling the share issuance and ordering dissolution.

**Holdings & Rulings:**

*   **G.R. No. 153690 (Forum Shopping):** Deemed MOOT. The CA's dismissal of the *original* complaint based on non-forum shopping was mooted by the RTC's subsequent order to amend the complaint and its later admission of the amended complaint. An amended complaint supersedes the original (Rule 10, Section 8, Rules of Court).

*   **G.R. No. 157381 (Receivership Injunction):** Deemed MOOT. The CA's injunction against the RTC hearing the motion to lift the receivership was mooted by the RTC's *subsequent* decision on the merits (dissolving LLDC and creating a management committee). The act sought to be enjoined became *fait accompli*.

*   **G.R. No. 170889 (Docket Fees & Injunction):** DISMISSED. The Court held that the original action was one incapable of pecuniary estimation. Even assuming insufficient docket fees, the Lu Ym group was estopped from raising the issue due to active participation in proceedings below. Insufficiency, if any, was attributable to the Clerk of Court's assessment, and any deficiency may be considered a lien on the judgment. The denial of the preliminary injunction was upheld as the Lu Ym group failed to demonstrate a clear right or irreparable harm.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 10, Section 8, Rules of Court:** Amended pleading supersedes the original.
*   **Rule 7, Section 5, Rules of Court:** Certification against forum shopping requirements.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Remedy for challenging interlocutory orders.
*   **Rule 58, Section 3, Rules of Court:** Requisites for preliminary injunction.
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8799:** The Securities Regulation Code, under which the interim rules of procedure for intra-corporate controversies are promulgated.
*   **Loquias v. Ombudsman:** Cited by the CA regarding the dismissal of the complaint

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Appeal on the Merits (CA-G.R. CV No. 81163):** The Court's decision emphasizes that the core dispute (merits of share issuance, dissolution) remains pending appeal before the CA. The outcome of this appeal is critical.
*   **Fiduciary Duty:** The core allegation of breach of fiduciary duty by the Lu Ym group in issuing the shares is a significant point for determination on appeal.
*   **Dissolution of LLDC:** The implications of the dissolution order, if upheld on appeal, are substantial, requiring liquidation and impacting all shareholders.
*   **Management Committee:** If dissolution is upheld the powers and responsibilities of the management committee, and the process of its operations become legally important.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision primarily addresses procedural issues and mootness. The underlying intra-corporate dispute remains to be decided on the merits by the Court of Appeals. Potential liabilities and risks are contingent upon the CA's decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 81163. The core legal issue revolves around whether the Lu Ym group breached their fiduciary duties and whether the issuance of the shares was valid.
