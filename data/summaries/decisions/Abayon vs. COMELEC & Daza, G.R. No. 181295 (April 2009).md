## Legal Document Summary: Abayon v. COMELEC & Daza (G.R. No. 181295, April 2, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition under Rule 65 challenging COMELEC's dismissal of an election protest for being filed out of time.

**Facts:**

*   Abayon and Daza were candidates for Governor of Northern Samar in the 2007 elections. Daza was proclaimed winner on May 20, 2007.
*   Abayon filed multiple petitions with COMELEC:
    *   SPC No. 07-037 (filed May 19, 2007): Exclusion of COCs from Capul, Rosario, and Bobon due to *duress, threats, and intimidation* (alleging army involvement, killings, prevented rallies, vote buying).
    *   SPC No. 07-069: Exclusion of COC from Catubig (similar grounds). Denied by COMELEC 2nd Division.
    *   SPC No. 07-070 (filed May 21, 2007): Annulment of Daza's proclamation, based on the unresolved SPC No. 07-037.
    *   SPA No. 07-460: Failure of elections in Capul, Rosario, and Bobon. Dismissed by COMELEC en banc.
    *   SPC No. 07-484: Failure of elections in Catubig. Dismissed by COMELEC en banc.
*   Abayon filed his actual election protest (EPC No. 2007-62) on June 29, 2007, contesting Daza's election.
*   COMELEC dismissed EPC No. 2007-62 as untimely, reasoning that the pre-proclamation petitions did not raise valid pre-proclamation issues and thus did not toll the 10-day period to file an election protest under Section 250 of the Omnibus Election Code. COMELEC relied on *Villamor v. COMELEC*, holding that a petition for annulment of proclamation must be based on a valid pre-proclamation issue to suspend the protest period.
*   COMELEC en banc affirmed this dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 250 of the Omnibus Election Code:**  Requires filing an election protest within 10 days of proclamation.
*   **Section 248 of the Omnibus Election Code:** Filing a petition to annul or suspend proclamation suspends the period for filing an election protest.
*   **Section 243 of the Omnibus Election Code:** Restricts the issues that may be raised in a pre-proclamation controversy to (a) illegal composition of the board of canvassers; (b) incomplete, tampered or falsified election returns; (c) election returns prepared under duress; and (d) fraudulent substitute returns.
*   **Section 20(i) of RA 7166:** Prohibits proclamation without COMELEC authorization after a pre-proclamation case is filed (unless contested returns wouldn't affect the result).

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Election Protest:** Abayon's protest is dismissed as untimely, preventing a full review of the election results.
*   **Void Proclamation (Dissent's View):**  The dissenting opinion argues that Daza's proclamation was void *ab initio* under Section 20(i) of RA 7166 because it occurred while SPC No. 07-037 was pending, *regardless* of the ultimate merits of that petition. This position is highly unfavorable to Daza.
*   **Potential for Equal Protection Violation (Dissent's View):**  The dissent argues that the COMELEC didn't independently resolve the pre-proclamation cases and is selectively applying Section 16 of RA 7166.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code (OEC):** Sections 243, 248, 250 (key provisions regarding pre-proclamation issues, suspension of filing period, and the protest deadline)
*   **Republic Act No. 7166:** Section 16 (termination of pre-proclamation cases) and Section 20(i) (prohibition against proclaiming a candidate pending a pre-proclamation case).
*   **Villamor v. COMELEC (G.R. No. 169865):** A petition to annul proclamation must be based on valid pre-proclamation issues to suspend the protest period.
*   **Dagloc v. COMELEC (378 Phil. 906):** Clarifies that Section 248 refers to "pre-proclamation controversies". Failure of election petitions do not suspend the period.
*   **Utto v. COMELEC:** Strict application of Section 20(i) of RA 7166

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Pre-Proclamation Controversy":**  The core issue is whether Abayon's allegations of duress and intimidation in SPC No. 07-037 constitute a valid pre-proclamation controversy under Section 243(c) of the OEC.  The Court finds they do *not*, but the dissent disagrees and argues there was a filing which mandated further inquiry under section 20(i) of RA 7166
*   **Application of Section 20(i) of RA 7166:** Whether the proclamation's validity can be retrospectively invalidated based on the *ultimate* finding that the pre-proclamation petition lacked merit, or whether its validity is determined at the time of the proclamation based on the *pending* pre-proclamation petition.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the COMELEC's dismissal of Abayon's election protest. The majority reasoned that the election protest was filed out of time because the pre-proclamation cases filed by Abayon did not raise issues that could be validly considered pre-proclamation controversies under Section 243 of the Omnibus Election Code, and therefore did not suspend the 10-day period for filing the protest. The dissenting opinion argued that COMELEC made several statutory and procedural errors, and that the Board of Canvassers proclamation was premature and illegal. The court's decision highlights the importance of adhering to the specific grounds allowed for pre-proclamation controversies to successfully toll the election protest filing deadline.
