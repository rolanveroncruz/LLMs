## Legal Document Summary: People v. Ranin, Jr., G.R. No. 173023 (2008)

**Nature of the Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court affirming with modification the Court of Appeals' decision, which in turn affirmed the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Resurreccion Ranin, Jr. for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction for Murder:** Ranin was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murdering Niño Calinao.
*   **Qualifying Circumstances:** The killing was qualified as murder due to treachery and evident premeditation. De Castro’s testimony, though with some inconsistencies, was deemed credible.
*   **Penalty Modification:** Due to Republic Act No. 9346 (Anti-Death Penalty Law), the original death sentence was reduced to *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole, as mandated by the statute.
*   **Damages:** The court modified the damages awarded by the trial court.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Ranin's Obligation:** To serve *reclusion perpetua*. Also to indemnify the heirs of Niño Calinao in the amounts of P42,000 as actual damages, P50,000 as moral damages, P75,000 as civil indemnity, and P25,000 as exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Witness Credibility:** The defense challenged the credibility of the key witness (De Castro) based on inconsistencies in her testimony. The court found these inconsistencies to be minor and not affecting the substance of her declaration, relying on *People v. Bustamante* (G.R. Nos. 140724-26) and *People v. Sades* (G.R. No. 171087).
*   **Physical Incapacity:** Ranin claimed physical incapacity to fire the weapon due to injuries to his hands. The court found that the prosecution sufficiently proved his ability to use his right hand, relying on testimony showing that he used his right hand to fire the gun.
*   **Judge Who Heard the Testimony:** Ranin argued the trial court’s decision should not be respected because the judge who penned the decision was not the same judge who heard the testimonies. The Supreme Court, relying on *People v. Buayaban* (G.R. No. 112459), held that the new judge could rely on transcripts of stenographic notes, thereby not violating substantive and procedural due process.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The testimony of De Castro, regarding the timeline between the shots, and the distance of the shooter from the victim was questioned by the defense. The court, however, dismissed these inconsistencies as minor details.
*   The actual ability of Ranin to fire the .45 caliber pistol given the state of his right hand was also disputed by the defense. The court, however, found that the prosecution sufficiently proved Ranin’s ability to use his right hand to fire the gun.
