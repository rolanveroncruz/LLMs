**Legal Document Summary: *Bonifacio Obrero v. Atty. Ma. Victoria A. Acidera***

**Nature of Document:** Resolution of an administrative case before the Supreme Court of the Philippines.

**Key Issue:** Whether Atty. Acidera, Clerk of Court, is guilty of Gross Ignorance of the Rules, Gross Incompetence, Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, and failing to measure up to the ethical standards in government prescribed under R.A. No. 6713.

**Key Provisions:**
*   The case centers on Atty. Acidera's acceptance for filing of motions with notices improperly addressed to the Clerk of Court instead of all parties concerned, in violation of Section 5, Rule 15, of the Rules of Court.

**Obligations/Duties Violated:**
*   Atty. Acidera failed to comply with her mandatory duty to ensure pleadings submitted to the court met minimum procedural requirements, specifically, that notices of hearing be addressed to all parties concerned.  This duty is tied to her position as Clerk of Court.
*   Failing to recognize that Motions addressed to the Clerk of Court and not to the parties concerned should not be accepted for filing.

**Liabilities:**
*   **Administrative Liability:** Found guilty of Ignorance of the Law. Fined Php 10,000.
*   **Potential Future Liability:** Warned that similar offenses will be dealt with more severely.

**Potential Risks:**
*   Atty. Acidera's conduct demonstrated a lack of competence in even the simplest duty.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **Section 5, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court:** Mandates that notices of hearing be addressed to all parties concerned. This is the primary basis of the ruling.
*   **R.A. No. 6713:** Ethical standards in government, which the complainant alleged the respondent failed to uphold.
*   **Cledera v. Sarmiento, 148-A Phil. 468, 485 (1971):**  This case supports the idea that motions with defective notice are mere scraps of paper.
*   **Omico Mining and Industrial Corporation v. Judge Vallejos, 159 Phil. 886, 899 (1975):**  This reinforces that a fatally defective motion is a "useless piece of paper."
*   **Alvarez v. Diaz, 468 Phil. 347, 372 (2004).** Importance of Clerks of Court and their competence to uphold the standards of the court.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*   While the Court emphasized the ministerial nature of the Clerk of Court's duties, it concurrently stressed the duty to exercise prudence in verifying compliance with procedural requirements. This might create ambiguity regarding the scope of a Clerk of Court's responsibility in reviewing filed motions.

**Conclusion:**
The Court found Atty. Acidera liable for ignorance of the law, and that her position necessitates a certain level of procedural knowledge which she was found to be lacking.
