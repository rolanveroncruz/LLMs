## Legal Document Summary: Air Services Cooperative v. Court of Appeals, et al.

**Case:** G.R. No. 118693, July 23, 1998

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Air Services Cooperative and Capt. Antonio S. Sarael (deceased, now represented by the Cooperative).
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals, Regional Trial Court, Labor Arbiter Antonio M. Villanueva, and Recarido Batican.

**Subject Matter:** Petition for review on certiorari of the Court of Appeals' decision denying petitioners' petition for certiorari, which sought to annul the Labor Arbiter's decision for lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Facts:**

*   Recarido Batican, a member of Air Services Cooperative, was expelled for allegedly pilfering aviation fuel.
*   Stanfilco (Dole Philippines, Inc.) filed a criminal complaint against Batican for qualified theft
*   Batican filed a complaint with the NLRC against the Cooperative and Capt. Sarael for illegal dismissal and other monetary claims.
*   The Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of Batican, declaring his dismissal illegal.
*   Instead of appealing to the NLRC, the Cooperative filed a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition and Annulment of Judgment before the Regional Trial Court (RTC), arguing the Labor Arbiter lacked jurisdiction.
*   The RTC dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, stating it was a substitute for an appeal to the NLRC.
*   The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC's decision, holding that appeal to the NLRC was the proper remedy.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** The Cooperative argued the Labor Arbiter lacked jurisdiction over the dispute, claiming it fell under the jurisdiction of the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) because it was a dispute between cooperative members. The Supreme Court sidestepped definitively ruling on this jurisdictional issue, focusing instead on procedural errors.
*   **Procedural Error:** The core issue is whether the Cooperative properly challenged the Labor Arbiter's decision. The Cooperative bypassed the proper appellate process by filing a Petition for Certiorari in the RTC instead of appealing to the NLRC.
*   **Article 223 of the Labor Code:** The Court emphasized that Article 223 of the Labor Code provides for appeal to the NLRC from decisions of the Labor Arbiter. The Court interpreted the grounds for appeal under Art. 223, specifically "abuse of discretion," to encompass the grounds for a petition for certiorari, and therefore, address the claim of lack of jurisdiction by the Labor Arbiter.
*   **Exclusive Appellate Jurisdiction:** The Court cited Article 217(b) of the Labor Code, emphasizing the NLRC's exclusive appellate jurisdiction over cases decided by Labor Arbiters.
*   **Finality of Judgment:** Because the Cooperative failed to appeal to the NLRC within the prescribed period, the Labor Arbiter's decision became final and executory.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 442 (Labor Code):** Articles 217(b) and 223 are central to the Court's decision.
*   **Balais v. Velasco, 252 SCRA 707 (1996):** Regular courts lack jurisdiction over matters arising from labor case decisions.
*   **Asuncion v. National Labor Relations Commission, 273 SCRA 498 (1997):** Appeal to the NLRC is the proper remedy for a void judgment in labor cases.
*   **Johnson & Johnson (Phils.), Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 262 SCRA 298 (1996):** Litigations must have an end, and final judgments should be respected.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   The Cooperative is liable for the monetary awards in the Labor Arbiter's decision, as it has become final and executory.
*   Further litigation on the merits of the illegal dismissal claim is foreclosed due to the procedural errors.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the Cooperative contends the Labor Arbiter lacked jurisdiction because it was an internal cooperative matter, the Court did not directly rule on this issue. Therefore, the question of whether disputes between cooperative members concerning their employment relationship fall within the NLRC's jurisdiction or the CDA's remains open.
