**Legal Document Summary: *Ridjo Tape & Chemical Corp. v. Manila Electric Co.* (G.R. No. 126074)**

**Case:** Petition for review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that reversed the Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruling, ordering Ridjo Tape & Chemical Corp. and Ridjo Paper Corporation (Petitioners) to pay Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO) for unregistered electric consumption.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Service Agreement:** Establishes the terms for electricity supply, including billing based on meter readings and provisions for estimated consumption in case of meter failure. Crucially, the agreement states that if a meter fails to register full energy consumption, the customer will be billed for estimated consumption based on prior usage.
*   **Disputed Clause:** Interpretation of the clause regarding meter failure. Petitioners argue it only applies to tampering, while MERALCO claims it covers any meter malfunction.

**Obligations:**

*   **MERALCO:** Obligated to provide electric service and maintain its equipment, including meters, in good working order. Duty of reasonable inspection and timely repair of defects.
*   **Petitioners:** Obligated to pay for electricity consumed, as measured by the meter or estimated in case of meter failure.

**Liabilities:**

*   The central issue is whether the Petitioners are liable for unregistered consumption due to defective meters, absent evidence of tampering.
*   **CA Decision:** Initially held petitioners liable for full differential billings.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Modified the CA decision, holding MERALCO partially responsible due to its negligence in failing to detect and repair the defective meters in a timely manner. Limited Petitioners' liability to estimated consumption based on a three-month average prior to the dispute.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Contract of Adhesion:** The Service Agreement is characterized as a contract of adhesion, raising potential issues of unequal bargaining power. While binding, ambiguities are construed against the drafter (MERALCO). *See Philippine Bank of Communications v. Court of Appeals, 253 SCRA 241 (1996).*
*   **Ambiguity in Meter Failure Clause:** The phrase "stoppage or failure by any meter to register the full amount of energy consumed" is ambiguous. The Supreme Court ultimately interprets it to include both tampering and mechanical failure but then tempers the Petitioners' liability based on MERALCO's concurrent negligence.
*   **Negligence of MERALCO:** MERALCO's failure to detect and address the defective meters despite regular inspections for an extended period is deemed negligence. This negligence mitigates Petitioners' liability.
*   **P.D. No. 401:** While not directly invoked, the Court mentions that MERALCO should have filed a criminal complaint under Presidential Decree No. 401 if there was evidence of tampering.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **General Contract Law:** The Court references general principles of contract law, including the binding nature of contracts, the permissibility of stipulations (subject to limitations), and the need for judicial interpretation when parties dispute contract terms.
*   **Contracts of Adhesion:** *Serra v. Court of Appeals, 229 SCRA 60 (1994)*.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 401:** Defines and penalizes the theft of electricity.
*   **Duty of Public Utilities:** *Mississippi Power Co. v. Thomas, 162 Miss 734* and *Osberne v. Tennessee Electric Power Co., 158 Tenn 278* highlight the duty of care and diligence required of public utilities.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court strikes a balance between upholding the Service Agreement and mitigating Petitioners' liability due to MERALCO's negligence. The decision underscores the importance of public utilities diligently maintaining their equipment and promptly addressing defects. It provides a framework for apportioning liability in cases of unregistered consumption due to defective meters, especially when the utility fails to exercise due diligence. The ambiguous drafting of the service agreement becomes a key factor.
