**Legal Document Summary: *Maria Luisa Park Association, Inc. vs. Samantha Marie T. Almendras and Pia Angela T. Almendras*, G.R. No. 171763, June 05, 2009**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Maria Luisa Park Association, Inc. (MLPAI), a homeowners' association.
*   **Respondents:** Samantha Marie T. Almendras and Pia Angela T. Almendras, homeowners and members of MLPAI.

**Key Issue:** Jurisdiction over a dispute between a homeowner and a homeowners' association regarding compliance with deed restrictions, specifically a prohibition against multi-dwelling: Is it the Regional Trial Court (RTC) or the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB)?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the HLURB has exclusive and original jurisdiction over the dispute.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Restriction:** MLPAI's Deed of Restriction contains a prohibition against multi-dwelling. Respondents allegedly violated this provision.
*   **MLPAI By-Laws:** Article XII of MLPAI's by-laws mandates amicable settlement and then arbitration for disputes.
*   **Obligation to Arbitrate:** The court emphasizes that MLPAI by-laws require arbitration before filing suit. Failure to exhaust this remedy is detrimental to the respondent.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The case concerns intra-corporate relations, giving HLURB jurisdiction under Executive Order No. 535, Presidential Decree No. 902-A, and Republic Act No. 8763.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Non-Compliance:** Respondents face potential penalties for violating the Deed of Restriction, including forfeiture of the construction bond and other penalties.
*   **Premature Litigation:** The court fault the respondents for pursuing litigation without attempting to resolve the dispute via amicable settlement and arbitration as required by the MLPAI by-laws.
*   **Jurisdictional Challenge:** Risk of having a case dismissed for lack of jurisdiction if filed in the wrong court.
*   **Enforcement of Restrictions:** MLPAI risks potentially inconsistent enforcement of its Deed of Restrictions if it fails to adequately utilize HLURB processes and enforce arbitration clauses.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Executive Order No. 535:** Transferred regulatory and adjudicative functions over homeowners associations from SEC to HIGC.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 902-A:** Grants HIGC (now HLURB) original and exclusive jurisdiction over intra-corporate controversies.
*   **Republic Act No. 8763:** "Home Guaranty Corporation Act of 2000", transferred powers and responsibilities over HOA's to HLURB.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 957:** The Subdivision and Condominium Buyers' Protective Decree.
*   **Executive Order No. 90:** Identifying the Government Agencies Essential for the National Shelter Program.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "multi-dwelling" prohibition in the Deed of Restriction may be subject to interpretation, leading to disputes over what constitutes a violation.
*   The respondents dispute that they violated any Deed of Restriction, suggesting a potential factual dispute that needs to be resolved.

**Potential Strategies and Next Steps for MLPAI:**

1.  **Enforce Arbitration:** Insist on strict compliance with the arbitration clause in its by-laws in future disputes.
2.  **HLURB Proceedings:** Pursue its claims through the HLURB to enforce compliance with the Deed of Restrictions.
3.  **Clarify Restrictions:** Consider amending the Deed of Restriction to clarify the definition of "multi-dwelling" to avoid future ambiguity.
