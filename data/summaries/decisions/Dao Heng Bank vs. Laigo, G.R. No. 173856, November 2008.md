## Legal Document Summary: *Dao Heng Bank, Inc. v. Sps. Laigo* (G.R. No. 173856)

**Case Overview:** This case involves a dispute over the foreclosure of real estate mortgages. The Sps. Laigo (Respondents) obtained loans from Dao Heng Bank, Inc. (now Banco de Oro Universal Bank, Petitioner), secured by mortgages over two parcels of land. Respondents defaulted, and Petitioner foreclosed. Respondents then filed suit seeking annulment of the foreclosure, claiming a prior verbal agreement for *dacion en pago* (transfer of property in satisfaction of debt).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Mortgage Agreements:** Valid mortgages were executed on October 28, 1996, November 18, 1996, and April 18, 1997, securing loans totaling P11 million.
*   **Default & Foreclosure:** Respondents defaulted on the loans. Petitioner foreclosed and was the highest bidder at auction for P10,776,242.
*   ***Dacion en Pago* Claim:** Respondents allege a verbal agreement with Dao Heng to settle the debt via *dacion en pago* of one of the mortgaged properties. They claim partial performance by paying for a property appraisal commissioned by the bank.
*   **Statute of Frauds:** Petitioner argues that the alleged *dacion en pago* is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds (Article 1403, Civil Code) due to lack of a written agreement.

**Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and reinstated the trial court's dismissal of the complaint. The SC held that the alleged *dacion en pago* was unenforceable because there was no perfect *dacion en pago* contract, and it was barred by the Statute of Frauds (Article 1403, Civil Code).

**Key Issues & Risks:**

*   **Enforceability of Verbal *Dacion en Pago*:** The central issue is whether the alleged verbal agreement for *dacion en pago* is enforceable, given the Statute of Frauds' requirement for written agreements in real estate transactions (Article 1403, Civil Code). *See Vda. de Jomoc v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 92871, August 2, 1991*.
*   **Partial Performance Exception:** Respondents argue that paying for the appraisal and delivering titles constitutes partial performance, taking the agreement out of the Statute of Frauds. The SC rejected this argument, reasoning that delivering titles is customary in mortgage agreements, and there was no agreement approving dacion after the appraisal of the properties.
*   **Meeting of the Minds:** The Court emphasized the need for "common consent" for a dacion en pago to extinguish a debt. They found there was no perfect dacion en pago contract *See Filinvest Credit Association v. Philippine Acetylene Co., 197 Phil. 394 (1982).*

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   **Respondents:** Liable for the outstanding debt to Petitioner, less any proceeds from the foreclosure sale.  They are also obligated to uphold the terms of the mortgage agreements.
*   **Petitioner:** Retains ownership of the foreclosed properties.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The existence and terms of the alleged verbal *dacion en pago* agreement are highly contentious.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Respondents may pursue other legal avenues to challenge the foreclosure or seek further damages.
*   Further litigation may be required to determine the remaining deficiency owed by Respondents after the foreclosure sale.
