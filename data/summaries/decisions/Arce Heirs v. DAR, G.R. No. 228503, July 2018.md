## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Ramon Arce, Sr. v. Department of Agrarian Reform*

**Case:** *Heirs of Ramon Arce, Sr. v. Department of Agrarian Reform*, G.R. No. 228503, July 25, 2018 (837 Phil. 220)

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA Decision regarding CARP coverage of land allegedly devoted to livestock raising.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Lands:** 76.39 hectares in Montalban, Rizal (TCT Nos. T-442673, 442674, 442675, 442676). Previously covered by a Notice of Coverage (NOC) under CARP.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:** Land is exempt from CARP coverage because it's a livestock farm (buffalo, carabao, goat) and not agricultural land, used for "feedlot operation" since the 1950s, predating RA 6657.
*   **DAR's Position:** Initially, the DAR Regional Director (RD) lifted the NOC, but the DAR Secretary reversed this decision, arguing the land was no longer used for livestock, relying on an ocular inspection report showing no livestock present.
*   **Office of the President (OP) Decision:** Reversed the DAR Secretary and granted the exclusion from CARP coverage, finding the land was dedicated to livestock raising.
*   **CA Decision:** Reversed the OP, siding with the DAR Secretary, stating the land was no longer exclusively, directly, and actually used for livestock activity.
*   **Supreme Court (SC) Ruling:** Granted the petition, reversed the CA, and upheld the exemption from CARP.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Obligation to prove the land was used for livestock raising *prior to* and *continuously* after the enactment of CARP (June 15, 1988) to qualify for exemption.
*   **DAR:** Obligation to conduct proper due process, including notice to landowners, and to properly assess the evidence related to land use.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **DAR's future attempts to classify land as agricultural:**  The DAR could potentially try again in the future to subject the property to CARP if the Heirs significantly change the land use to non-livestock activities, although the current Supreme Court decision sets a high bar for such a reversal.
*   **Conflicting factual findings:** Discrepancies between ocular inspection reports and documentary evidence, as seen in this case, highlight the risk of evidentiary challenges.
*   **Intervention by third parties:** While SAMANACA's intervention was denied, similar attempts by other parties claiming tenant rights or beneficiary status could occur.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988) (CARL):** The primary statute governing agrarian reform.
*   **Luz Farms v. The Honorable Secretary of the Department of Agrarian Reform (270 Phil. 151 (1990)):** Declared unconstitutional the inclusion of livestock lands under CARP coverage. Key precedent.
*   **Natalia Realty and Estate Developers and Investors Corp. Inc. v. Department of Agrarian Reform Sec. Benjamin T. Leong and Dir. Wilfredo Leano, DAR REGION IV (296-A Phil. 271, 278 (1993)):** Reiterated that industrial, commercial, and residential lands are not covered by CARL.
*   **Department of Agrarian Reform v. Vicente K. Uy (544 Phil. 308 (2007)):** Discussed, but ultimately *distinguished* by the SC in this case because of an incorrect interpretation made by the CA.
*   **Department of Agrarian Reform v. Sutton (510 Phil. 177 (2005)):** Declared DAR Administrative Order No. 9, Series of 1993, unconstitutional.
*   **Administrative Order No. 01, Series of 2004 (AO No. 01-04):** Defines "Feedlot Operation" (Intensive System).
*   **Administrative Order No. 09, Series of 1993:** This regulation prescribing the ratios of land to livestock was deemed unconstitutional by the SC.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Actually, Directly, Exclusively, and Continuously Used for Livestock Activity":** The interpretation of this phrase was the core issue. The DAR argued that the transfer of some livestock and the planting of napier grass negated exclusive livestock use. The SC, however, emphasized the connection to livestock raising and feedlot operations, giving weight to the Heirs' arguments.
*   **Validity of Ocular Inspection:** Ucag's inspection and its lack of notice to the Petitioners became contentious. The SC heavily criticized the procedure employed by Ucag, holding it did not follow Due Process.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court sided with the Heirs of Ramon Arce, Sr., finding that their land, historically used for livestock raising, was exempt from CARP. The ruling underscores the importance of historical land use, the connection to livestock operations (even in "feedlot" scenarios), and the need for due process in DAR proceedings. It also reinforces the precedent set in *Luz Farms* that livestock farms are not considered agricultural lands subject to agrarian reform.
