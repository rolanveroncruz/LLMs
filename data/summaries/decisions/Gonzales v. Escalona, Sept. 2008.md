### Legal Document Summary: Gonzales v. Escalona & Superada (A.M. No. P-03-1715)

**Nature:** This is an administrative case against Clerk of Court Joseph N. Escalona and Sheriff Edgar V. Superada for Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and Grave Misconduct in connection with the enforcement of a writ of execution in a criminal case (Crim. Case No. 2150).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Complainant's Allegation:** Complainant Felisa L. Gonzales alleges that respondents demanded and received unauthorized fees and colluded to benefit personally from the awarded damages. Specifically, Superada allegedly demanded expenses before service and received P7,000. Both respondents accepted postdated checks from the judgment debtorâ€™s employer, payable to Escalona, without the complainant's explicit consent. Escalona deducted P3,000 for "sheriff's fees" and P1,400 for "car use" from encashed checks.
*   **Respondents' Defenses:** Escalona denied instructing the employer to make checks payable to him and claimed the amounts received for car usage were based on an agreement with the accident victims. Superada admitted receiving P7,000 for expenses relating to apprehension of the accused and maintained a right to reimbursement for execution expenses.
*   **Investigating Judge's Findings:** Superada failed to comply with Sec. 9, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court regarding implementation of writs of execution. Escalona should have advised the complainant to open a bank account to endorse the checks rather than receive payment directly.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Sheriff's Obligations (Superada):** Obligation to follow Rule 141, Sec. 9, including obtaining court approval for expenses and providing a detailed report. Failure to do so constitutes grave misconduct.
*   **Clerk of Court's Obligations (Escalona):** High standard of moral rectitude, competence, honesty, and probity. Must safeguard the integrity of the court.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Transparency:** The lack of transparency regarding why checks were made payable to Escalona raises concerns.
*   **Unauthorized Fees:** The demands and acceptance of fees without court approval violate Rule 141 and raise risks of corruption.
*   **Connivance:** The Court inferred connivance between respondents based on the irregular payment arrangement, potentially violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (RA 3019).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 141, Sec. 9, Rules of Court:** Mandates court approval for sheriff's expenses related to execution. Violations constitute grave misconduct.
*   **RA 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees):** Sets ethical standards and requires prompt, courteous service.
*   **Cases Cited:** *Geolingo v. Albayda*, *Flores v. Falcotelo*, *Letter of Atty. Socorro M. Villamer-Basilla*, *Danao v. Franco, Jr.* emphasize the importance of compliance with rules regarding fees and ethical conduct for court personnel.
*   **Fletcher v. Grinnel Bros., et. al**: Whether a cause of action survives the death of the person depends on the substance of the cause of action and not on the form of the proceeding to enforce it.
*   **Sexton v. Casida**: The respondent, who in the meantime died, was found guilty of act unbecoming a public official and acts prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and fined Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00), deductible from his terminal leave pay.

**Outcome:**

*   Both respondents were found guilty of gross misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
*   Escalona was fined P10,000.00. His resignation did not render the case moot.
*   Superada, despite his death, was fined P10,000.00, deductible from his terminal leave pay. The court retained jurisdiction over the administrative case even after his death.
*   The investigation findings regarding potential violations of R.A. 3019 are beyond the court's authority in this administrative case.

**Potential Issues for Consideration:**

*   The possibility of criminal prosecution under R.A. 3019.
*   Liability to the accident victims whose judgements were affected by the respondents misconduct.
