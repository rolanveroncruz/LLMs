**Case Summary: Re: Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the Regional Trial Court Branch 24, Cebu City (A.M. No. 13-8-185-RTC)**

**Nature:** Administrative matter regarding undue delay in rendering decisions and orders.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Judicial Audit Findings:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) audit revealed a significant backlog in Branch 24 under Judge Olegario B. Sarmiento, Jr., including:
    *   42 cases submitted for decision, 21 beyond the 90-day reglementary period (Section 15(1) of the 1987 Constitution).
    *   46 cases with pending motions/incidents, 6 beyond the 90-day period.
    *   Significant number of cases without action or settings.
*   **Lack of Extension Requests:** Judge Sarmiento did not request extensions of time to decide/resolve cases.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** Initially recommended a fine of Php 50,000.00 for failure to decide/resolve cases within the reglementary period (Violation of Canon 3, Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct and Canon 6, Section 5 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary).
*   **Mitigating Factors:** Judge Sarmiento served for 20 years and assisted the succeeding judge in drafting decisions.

**Obligations:**

*   Judges must decide cases within 3 months for lower courts (Constitution, Canon 3 and Canon 6).
*   Duty to promptly dispose of court business.
*   Judges should request extensions if unable to meet deadlines.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Sarmiento found guilty of undue delay.
*   Imposition of a Php 20,000 fine (reduced from the initial Php 50,000).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity in Penalty:** The reduction in penalty highlights the subjective nature of administrative sanctions, even with clear violations of timelines. The decision emphasizes mitigating factors.
*   **Clerical Issues:** The report also flags potential clerical issues that were required to be dealt with ( Certificates of Arraignment)

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Garcia-Blanco*, 522 Phil. 87, 99 (2006) - Delay in justice administration deprives litigants of their rights.
*   *Re: Findings on the Judicial Audit Conducted in Regional Trial Court, Branch 8, La Trinidad, Benguet, A.M. Nos. 14-10-339-RTC and RTJ-16-2246, March 7, 2017, 819 SCRA 274, 307* - Failure to decide within the reglementary period constitutes gross inefficiency.
*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Casalan, 785 Phil. 350, 359 (2016)* - Honor and integrity of the judicial system measured by fairness and efficiency.
*   *Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the Regional Trial Court, Branch 8, Cebu City, 498 Phil. 478, 487 (2005)* - Courts are mindful of circumstances that may delay disposition and grant extensions.

**Statutory References:**

*   Section 15(1) of the 1987 Constitution
*   Canon 3, Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct
*   Canon 6, Section 5 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary

**Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   While the ruling finds Judge Sarmiento guilty, the reduction in fine suggests an assessment of culpability considering workload and service record. This could potentially set a precedent for leniency in similar cases, especially if mitigating circumstances are present.
