## Legal Document Summary: *Longino Buhisan vs. National Labor Relations Commission and San Miguel Corporation (G.R. No. 120616)*

**Summary:** This Supreme Court decision reverses the NLRC's ruling, finding that San Miguel Corporation (SMC) illegally dismissed Longino Buhisan (Petitioner) without just cause. SMC terminated Buhisan based on accusations of estafa and arson, alleging he misappropriated funds and destroyed company property to cover it up.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The core finding is that SMC failed to provide substantial evidence to justify Buhisan's dismissal, thus rendering it illegal.
*   **Reinstatement/Separation Pay:** The Court orders SMC to reinstate Buhisan to his former position. If reinstatement is infeasible due to strained relations, SMC must pay separation pay equivalent to one month's salary for each year of service.
*   **Back Wages:** SMC is liable for back wages from the dismissal date (April 29, 1991) until reinstatement, or until the actual payment of back wages if reinstatement is not feasible.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Buhisan is entitled to attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total judgment award.

**Obligations:**

*   SMC is obligated to reinstate Buhisan or pay separation pay.
*   SMC must pay back wages.
*   SMC must pay attorney's fees and costs of the suit.

**Liabilities:**

*   SMC is liable for monetary compensation due to the illegal dismissal.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Feasibility of Reinstatement:** The Court acknowledges "strained relations" as a potential impediment to reinstatement. This clause could become contentious if SMC argues reinstatement is impossible, leading to further litigation regarding the appropriate amount of separation pay.
*   **Calculation of Back Wages:** Determining the exact period and amount of back wages could be a point of contention, depending on Buhisan's earnings history and any potential deductions.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The decision implicitly relies on labor law principles regarding just cause for termination (Art. 297-302, Labor Code).
*   The case highlights the employer's burden of proof in dismissal cases, requiring substantial evidence.
*   The court scrutinizes the NLRC's reliance on the fiscal's finding of probable cause in the criminal case, emphasizing that it does not automatically equate to just cause for termination.
*   Estafa and Arson, although criminal in nature, are the alleged basis for serious misconduct and the need for substantial evidence to prove its veracity as basis for termination.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrasing regarding "strained relations" is subjective and may lead to disputes over whether reinstatement is truly infeasible.
*   The determination of the backwages amount may be subject to calculation disputes.
