**Case:** *Nozomi Fortune Services, Inc. vs. Celestino A. Naredo* (G.R. No. 221043, July 31, 2024)

**Summary:**

This case involves a complaint for illegal dismissal and regularization filed by Naredo against Nozomi and Samsung. The core issue is whether Nozomi acted as a legitimate independent contractor or a labor-only contractor in providing Naredo’s services to Samsung.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Labor-Only Contracting:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) finding that Nozomi was a labor-only contractor, effectively making Samsung the true employer of Naredo.
*   **Two-pronged Test for Labor-Only Contracting:**
    1.  Lack of Substantial Capital/Investment: Despite possessing capital, Nozomi failed to prove that it had tools, equipment, or machinery "actually and directly used" in performing the specific production work assigned to Naredo at Samsung. The tools and equipment were supplied by Samsung.
    2.  Directly Related Activities: The work performed by Naredo as a production operator was directly related to Samsung’s principal business of manufacturing microchips.
*   **Control Test:** Samsung exercised control over Naredo's work, providing instructions on the means, methods, and specifications of his job. This further solidifies the employer-employee relationship between Samsung and Naredo. *Ditiangkin v. Lazada E-Services Philippines, Inc., G.R. No. 246892, September 21, 2022.*
*   **DOLE Registration:** The SC reiterated that a DOLE Certificate of Registration is *not* conclusive proof of a contractor's legitimacy. It only prevents the presumption of labor-only contracting from arising. *Caballero v. Vikings Commissary, G.R. No. 238859, October 19, 2022.*

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Samsung as Employer:** As the true employer, Samsung is responsible for labor standards compliance and potential liabilities related to Naredo's employment.
*   **Nozomi as Agent:** As a labor-only contractor, Nozomi is considered an agent of Samsung and does not bear the employer’s responsibilities under the Labor Code.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Voluntary Resignation:** Despite the labor-only contracting finding, the SC denied Naredo's claim of illegal dismissal, upholding that he voluntarily resigned. This weakens Naredo's potential for backwages and other monetary claims.
*   **Proof of Coercion:** Naredo’s argument of coerced resignation lacked sufficient evidence. He bears the burden of proving the involuntariness of his resignation, making it a difficult factual issue. *Alenaje v. C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc., G.R. No. 249195, February 14, 2022.*
*   **Statutory References:** Article 106 of the Labor Code defines "labor-only" contracting and the rights of workers.

**Case Law:**

*   *Caballero v. Vikings Commissary, G.R. No. 238859, October 19, 2022* (Totality of circumstances considered in determining labor-only contracting)
*   *Ditiangkin v. Lazada E-Services Philippines, Inc., G.R. No. 246892, September 21, 2022* (Control test in determining employer-employee relationship)
*   *Alenaje v. C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc., G.R. No. 249195, February 14, 2022* (Burden of proof in resignation cases)
*   *Italkarat 18, Inc. v. Gerasmio, 886 Phil. 433, 448 (2020)* (Necessity of proving dismissal)

**Recommendations:**

*   Advise Samsung on potential liabilities arising from the labor-only contracting finding and ensure compliance with labor laws for all similarly situated employees.
*   Advise Naredo that illegal dismissal claims are less likely to succeed given the findings that he voluntarily resigned.
*   Re-evaluate service contracts with other manpower providers to avoid similar issues.
