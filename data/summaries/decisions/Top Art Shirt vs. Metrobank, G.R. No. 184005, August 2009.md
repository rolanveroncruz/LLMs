## Legal Document Summary - *Top Art Shirt Manufacturing, Inc. v. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company* (G.R. No. 184005, August 04, 2009)

**Case Summary:**

This Supreme Court decision upholds the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision annulling the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order that quashed a writ of possession in favor of Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (Metrobank). The core issue is whether the RTC erred in setting aside the writ of possession based on a motion to quash filed by Top Art Shirt Manufacturing, Inc. (Top Art). The SC found that the RTC erred because Top Art did not have standing to file the motion.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Act No. 3135, as amended:** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages. Section 7 allows the purchaser to petition for a writ of possession.
*   **Purchaser's Right to Possession:** Purchaser (Metrobank) has the right to a writ of possession *ex parte* upon consolidation of ownership (after redemption period), absent adverse possession by a *third party* as per Rule 39, Section 33 of the Revised Rules of Court.
*   **No Redemption:** Failure to redeem the foreclosed property within the statutory period leads to consolidation of title in the purchaser's (Metrobank) name.
*   **Ministerial Duty of Court:** Issuance of the writ of possession to the purchaser becomes a *ministerial* duty upon application and proof of title.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Top Art's Liability:** As the debtor in the loan agreement secured by the real estate mortgages, Top Art is liable for the debt and cannot claim to be a third party concerning the foreclosure proceedings.
*   **Spouses Arejola's Liability:** As the mortgagors and registered owners, they are bound by the mortgage agreement and the subsequent foreclosure.
*   **Risk of Eviction:** The writ of possession allows Metrobank to evict the Spouses Arejola and all those claiming rights under them.
*   **Third-Party Adverse Possession:** Metrobank's right to immediate possession can be defeated if a legitimate third party possesses the property adversely to the judgment debtor (Spouses Arejola).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135, as amended (specifically Secs. 7 & 8):** Framework for extrajudicial foreclosures and writ of possession.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 39, Section 33:** Details the execution of deed and possession at the expiration of the redemption period.
*   *De Gracia v. San Jose*, 94 Phil. 623 (1954): Expounds on application of Sec. 7 of Act No. 3135.
*   *IFC Service Leasing and Acceptance Corporation v. Nera*, 125 Phil. 595 (1967):  Reiterates ministerial duty to issue writ after the redemption period and consolidation.
*   *Roxas v. Buan*, G.R. No. L-53798, 167 SCRA 43 (1988):  Outlines the exception to the ministerial duty rule when a third party is in adverse possession.
*   *St. Dominic Corp. v. The Intermediate Appellate Court*, G.R. No. L-70623, 151 SCRA 577 (1987): Affirms absolute right to possession upon consolidation and court's duty to aid delivery.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Third-Party Possession:** The claim of Walter Santillan's lease and possession is disputed. The court found that Top Art's claim that Walter Santillan's physical possession was being threatened was insufficient proof, and he did not intervene in the case.
*   **Top Art's Standing:** Top Art argued it had standing as a "co-petitioner" with the Spouses Arejola. The Court rejected this, emphasizing Top Art was the debtor, not a third party, and the original pleadings were filed solely on behalf of Top Art. The belated claim that Top Art was a lessee was deemed contradictory and unconvincing.
*   **Metrobank's Knowledge of Lease:** The RTC's attribution of knowledge to Metrobank about the lease was rejected by the CA.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Further Litigation by Santillan:** Walter Santillan, the alleged lessee, retains the right to file a separate action to assert his leasehold rights and challenge Metrobank's possession. This could lead to protracted litigation and potentially delay Metrobank's ability to fully utilize the property.

**Conclusion:**

Metrobank's right to possession is affirmed based on consolidation of ownership and lack of legitimate third-party adverse possession. Top Art and the Spouses Arejola's petition is denied. However, the possibility of future litigation by Walter Santillan presents a lingering risk.
