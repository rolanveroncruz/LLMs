Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court Resolution:

**Case:** *Jessica Lucila G. Reyes v. Director, Camp Bagong Diwa, et al.* G.R. No. 254838, May 22, 2024

**Nature:** Resolution denying with finality the Office of the Solicitor General's (OSG) Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration of the Court's January 17, 2023 Resolution granting Reyes' Petition for Habeas Corpus.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Habeas Corpus Granted:** The Court previously granted habeas corpus to Reyes due to a violation of her constitutional right to speedy trial, finding her prolonged detention (nearly nine years) oppressive despite a Sandiganbayan commitment order.
*   **OSG's Motion:** The OSG's Omnibus Motion argued that habeas corpus was not the proper remedy, and sought reconsideration of the factual and legal bases of the original Resolution, claiming it could set a dangerous precedent.
*   **Court's Rejection:** The Court found the OSG's arguments to be rehashed and without substantial merit, reaffirming its earlier decision. The Court emphasized that the peculiar and protracted circumstances of the case, including delays in the Sandiganbayan proceedings, constituted a violation of Reyes' right to speedy trial justifying the writ.
*   **Right to Speedy Trial**: The court reiterate that the right to speedy trial is violated when the proceeding is attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays; or unjustified postponements of the trial are asked for and secured; or without cause or justifiable motive, a long period of time is allowed to lapse without the party having his or her case tried.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 7080 (Plunder Law):** Reyes was charged under this law, leading to her detention.
*   **R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Reyes was also charged with violations of this act.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 118, Section 4:** Referenced regarding pre-trial orders and their controlling effect.
*   **Conde v. Rivera, 45 Phil. 650 (1924):** Cited as precedent for granting habeas corpus based on violation of the right to speedy trial. The OSG argued against its applicability, but the Court upheld its relevance.
*   **Moncupa v. Enrile, 225 Phil. 191 (1986):** Cited to stress the purpose of the writ of habeas corpus, to inquire into all manner of involuntary restraint as distinguished from voluntary, and to relieve a person therefrom if such restraint is illegal.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligations:** The original Resolution releasing Reyes imposed conditions: personal attendance at Sandiganbayan hearings, quarterly reports on her whereabouts, and travel authority from the Sandiganbayan for foreign travel. Failure to comply would lead to re-arrest and detention.
*   **Respondent's Obligation:** The Warden of Taguig City Jail Female Dormitory was ordered to immediately release Reyes.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Precedent Setting:** The OSG argued the Resolution could set a "dangerous precedent," suggesting a concern about the ease with which accused individuals might claim speedy trial violations to secure release via habeas corpus. This argument failed to persuade the Court.
*   **Delay Involvement:** The OSG argued that Reyes herself contributed to the trial delays, attempting to undermine her claim of speedy trial violation. This point was addressed by the Court, which acknowledged Reyes' legal challenges but emphasized that the prosecution failed to adequately justify the prolonged proceedings.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reaffirmed its decision to grant habeas corpus to Jessica Lucila G. Reyes, finding her prolonged pre-trial detention violated her right to a speedy trial. The Court rejected the OSG's arguments for reconsideration, emphasizing the specific and oppressive circumstances of Reyes' case. The ruling highlights the Court's willingness to use habeas corpus as a remedy when pre-trial delays become egregious, even when the initial detention was based on a valid court order. While this decision is final in this specific case, there is the potential for it to be interpreted and applied in future cases involving similar circumstances.
