Here's a legal summary of the provided decision in *Arangote v. Maglunob*, 599 Phil. 91 (2009), formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Elvira T. Arangote v. Sps. Martin Maglunob and Lourdes S. Maglunob, and Romeo Salido*, G.R. No. 178906, February 18, 2009.

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review on Certiorari involving Quieting of Title, Declaration of Ownership, and related claims regarding Lot 12897 in Maloco, Ibajay, Aklan.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Arangote claims ownership based on OCT No. CLOA-1748, derived from an Affidavit (treated as a Donation) by Esperanza Maglunob-Dailisan.
*   Respondents Maglunob and Salido claim co-ownership with Esperanza as heirs of Martin Maglunob (Martin I), contending Esperanza could not validly waive/donate the entire property.
*   The land's origin traces back to Pantaleon and Placida Maglunob, then to Victorino Sorrosa (Placida's husband), and subsequently partitioned among heirs, including Esperanza.
*   Respondents filed a counterclaim in the MCTC case, attacking the validity of Arangote's title and the Affidavit.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals and RTC's decisions, declaring the respondents (and other heirs of Martin Maglunob) the lawful owners and possessors of the subject property. Arangote's petition was denied.

**Key Provisions and Analysis:**

*   **Affidavit as Invalid Donation:** The Court found Esperanza's Affidavit was effectively a donation of immovable property. It was deemed void *ab initio* due to non-compliance with Article 749 of the Civil Code (lack of acceptance in a public document and formal notification to the donor). *Sumipat v. Banga*, G.R. No. 155810, 13 August 2004, 436 SCRA 521, is cited for the principle that title doesn't pass until acceptance and notification occur.
*   **Direct Attack on Title:**  The Court held that the respondents' counterclaim constituted a *direct attack* on Arangote's OCT No. CLOA-1748, not a collateral one, thus permissible under Section 48 of P.D. No. 1529. This sidestepped the one-year limitation on attacking titles based on fraud, as the counterclaim sought to nullify the title itself. *Leyson v. Bontuyan*, G.R. No. 156357, 18 February 2005, 453 SCRA 94, cited for the distinction between direct and collateral attacks.
*   **Validity of CLOA issuance:** The CLOA issuance to Arangote was found questionable, as she and her husband were not tenants of the property. The Court found it highly suspicious that the petitioner was able to secure the CLOA from DAR as she didn't fulfill the requirements of R.A. No. 6657.
*   **No Good Faith:** Arangote was not considered a possessor or builder in good faith (Articles 448 and 546 of the Civil Code). Her reliance solely on the Affidavit and a tax declaration for ownership was deemed insufficient, putting her on notice of potential title defects. A tax declaration is not proof of ownership. *De Vera-Cruz v. Miguel*, G.R. No. 144103, 31 August 2005, 468 SCRA 506, is referenced regarding tax declarations.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Arangote is ordered to turn over possession of the subject property to the respondents.
*   Arangote does not have recourse for improvements made on the property.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The decision retroactively invalidates the CLOA, potentially creating uncertainty for other grantees under similar circumstances.
*   The application of Article 749 regarding donations is strictly construed, requiring meticulous compliance with acceptance and notification procedures.
*   The finding that a claim filed 7 August 1993 before the Lupon was sufficient notice of ownership is questionable.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code, Articles 448, 526, 546, 749.
*   Presidential Decree No. 1529, Section 48.
*   Republic Act No. 6657, Section 22.
