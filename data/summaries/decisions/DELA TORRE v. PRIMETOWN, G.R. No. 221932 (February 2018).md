## Legal Document Summary: Dela Torre v. Primetown Property Group, Inc. (G.R. No. 221932)

**Nature of Document:**  Supreme Court Decision in a Petition for Review on Certiorari concerning corporate rehabilitation proceedings.

**Key Issue:**  Whether the Stay Order issued in Primetown's corporate rehabilitation proceedings barred Dela Torre's intervention seeking specific performance (execution of a deed of sale for a condominium unit).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the Stay Order *did* bar Dela Torre's intervention.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Stay Order (PD 902-A, Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation, Rule 4, Sec. 6):**  Suspends *all* claims (money or otherwise) against Primetown, prohibits the sale or encumbrance of property outside the ordinary course of business, and prohibits payment of liabilities outstanding as of the petition's filing date. This is intended to allow the rehabilitation receiver to effectively manage the company's restructuring.
*   **Definition of "Claim" (Interim Rules, Rule 2, Sec. 1):** Broadly defined to include "all claims or demands of whatever nature or character against a debtor or its property, whether for money or otherwise."
*   **Intervention Prohibition (Interim Rules, Rule 3, Sec. 1):** Intervention is a prohibited pleading in corporate rehabilitation proceedings.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Dela Torre's Claim:** The SC determined Dela Torre's prayer for specific performance (execution of the deed of sale) constitutes a "claim" subject to the Stay Order. Her failure to file a timely opposition to the rehabilitation petition barred her participation in the proceedings.
*   **Primetown's Obligations:**  Primetown is protected by the Stay Order from being forced to transfer assets outside the rehabilitation process.
*   **Risk of Undue Preference:** The RTC's order granting intervention and directing Primetown to execute the deed of sale was deemed a violation of the law, as it gave undue preference to Dela Torre over other creditors.
*   **Non-Adversarial Nature of Rehabilitation:** The Court reiterated that rehabilitation proceedings are summary and non-adversarial, unsuitable for adjudicating contested claims.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree (PD) 902-A (as amended by RA 8799):**  Governs corporate rehabilitation and suspension of payments.
*   **Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation (A.M. No. 00-8-10-SC):**  Applicable rules for rehabilitation petitions.
*   **Securities Regulation Code (RA 8799):** Amended Section 5 of PD 902-A, transferring jurisdiction to RTCs.
*   **Town and Country Enterprises, Inc. v. Hon. Quisumbing, Jr., et al. (696 Phil. 1 (2012)):** Distinguished by the Court because in that case, the creditor had already acquired ownership of the mortgaged properties *before* the Stay Order was issued. Here, Dela Torre's ownership claim was disputed.
*   **Advent Capital and Finance Corporation v. Alcantara, et al., (680 Phil. 238 (2012)):** The Court stated that rehabilitation proceedings are summary and non-adversarial in nature.
*   **Negros Navigation Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals (594 Phil. 96 (2008)):** Discussed the justification for the suspension of actions or claims, without distinction, pending rehabilitation proceedings.
*   **Spouses Sobrejuanite v. ASB Development Corp., (508 Phil. 715 (2005)):** Cited for the definition of "claim."

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Claim":** While broadly defined, its application to actions for specific performance where full payment is alleged, but disputed, could be considered arguable. However, the Court held that the Stay Order applied regardless.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Supreme Court correctly applied the Interim Rules and PD 902-A.  The broad definition of "claim" under the Interim Rules clearly encompasses Dela Torre's action.  Furthermore, the Court's emphasis on the non-adversarial and summary nature of rehabilitation proceedings supports the denial of intervention.  The *Town and Country Enterprises* case was properly distinguished based on the timing of the creditor's acquisition of ownership. The fact that her full payment was contested placed her claim squarely within the ambit of claims suspended under the Stay Order. The denial of intervention aligns with the rehabilitation court's mandate to efficiently manage the debtor's assets and liabilities for the benefit of all creditors, and to prevent undue preference.
