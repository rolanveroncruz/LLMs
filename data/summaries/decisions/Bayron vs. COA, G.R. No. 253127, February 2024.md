## Legal Document Summary: Bayron vs. COA (G.R. No. 253127)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration

**Case Overview:** This case concerns the validity of Puerto Princesa City's (PPCG) Early & Voluntary Separation Incentive Program (EVSIP) established via Ordinance No. 438 and Resolution No. 850-2010. The Commission on Audit (COA) disallowed disbursements made under the EVSIP, leading to a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court, initially denied. This resolution addresses the petitioners' motion for reconsideration.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **EVSIP Validity:** The core issue is whether the EVSIP is an *ultra vires* act, violating Section 28(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 186, as amended by Republic Act No. 4968 (Teves Retirement Law), which prohibits separate, parallel, and supplementary early retirement plans. The Court reaffirms its earlier decision that the EVSIP does violate this provision.
*   **COA Authority & Collateral Attack:** Petitioners argued that COA's Notices of Disallowance (NDs) constituted a collateral attack on the ordinance. The Court acknowledges the COA's improper use of language invalidating the ordinance in the NDs, but clarifies that the COA's disallowance power is valid, citing *Abella v. Commission on Audit Proper* (G.R. No. 238940). COA has the authority to disallow disbursements contrary to law, but only courts can declare an ordinance null and void.
*   **Analogy to *City of General Santos v. COA*:** Petitioners attempted to analogize their case to *City of General Santos v. Commission on Audit* (733 Phil. 687), arguing the EVSIP was a one-time adjunct to a reorganization. The Court distinguishes the cases, finding insufficient evidence of a *bona fide* reorganization effort to justify the EVSIP, unlike the established reorganization plan in *City of General Santos*. The incentives are based on the employee's years of service, indicating a supplementary retirement benefit.
*   **Good Faith:** Petitioners claimed good faith in enacting and implementing the EVSIP. The Court partially grants the motion for reconsideration, absolving Roberto D. Herrera (Supervising Administrative Officer/Acting Assistant Budget Officer) and Mylene J. Atienza (Administrative Officer IV/Member of the Screening & Evaluation Committee) of monetary liability. Their roles were ministerial in implementing the ordinance, not in enacting it. However, it maintains its previous stance regarding the other petitioners, especially the members of the Sangguniang Panlungsod, and upholds its deferral to the Ombudsman's investigation for a determination of bad faith.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Herrera and Atienza:** Released from monetary liability for the disallowed funds.
*   **Bayron, Carbonell, Gadiano, and Oliveros III:** Subject to the Ombudsman's investigation for potential administrative and criminal liability. They remain liable to refund disallowed amounts pending a determination of good faith.
*   **COA:** Instructed to use appropriate language in future NDs, avoiding legal pronouncements exclusive to the judiciary.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of good faith for the remaining petitioners:** Whether the Ombudsman will find sufficient evidence to absolve Bayron, Carbonell, Gadiano, and Oliveros III from liability depends on the evidence presented and the Ombudsman's interpretation of their roles and intentions.
*   **Retroactive Application:** The impact on employees who availed of the EVSIP benefits in good faith before the ordinance was declared *ultra vires* is not explicitly addressed, but the *operative fact doctrine* could potentially mitigate the negative consequences for those employees.

**Statutory References:**

*   Commonwealth Act No. 186 (Government Service Insurance Act)
*   Republic Act No. 4968 (Amendment to CA 186)
*   Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code)
*   Republic Act No. 6683 s. 1988 (Providing benefits for early retirement)

**Case Law:**

*   *Abella v. Commission on Audit Proper* (G.R. No. 238940) - Regarding COA's power to disallow illegal disbursements.
*   *City of General Santos v. Commission on Audit* (733 Phil. 687) - Distinguishes the EVSIP from a valid reorganization-related early retirement program.
*   *Araullo, et al. v. Aquino III* (752 Phil. 716) - Regarding good faith of officers.
*   *Madera v. Commission on Audit* (882 Phil. 744) - Regarding good faith of officers.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's resolution partially grants the motion for reconsideration, absolving two petitioners (Herrera and Atienza). However, it largely affirms its original decision, upholding the COA's disallowance and declaring Ordinance No. 438 and Resolution No. 850-2010 *ultra vires*. The remaining petitioners face potential liability pending the Ombudsman's investigation. The case underscores the importance of adherence to national laws in local government budgetary appropriations and the limitations on supplementary retirement benefits.
