**Legal Document Summary: *Ardoza v. Gal-Lang and Grijaldo*, A.M. No. RTJ-97-1385 (1998)**

**Type:** Administrative Case against Judge Lolita O. Gal-Lang and Clerk of Court Nenita R. Grijaldo of the Regional Trial Court, Manila, Branch 44.

**Complaint:** Grave abuse of authority, manifest bias, gross ignorance of the law, knowingly rendering an unjust judgment, grave misconduct (Judge Gal-Lang); grave misconduct, gross ignorance, disrespect for the Rules of Court, malfeasance, and misfeasance in public office (Clerk of Court Grijaldo).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Criminal Case Origin:** The complaint arises from Criminal Case No. 95-146559 (illegal recruitment) where Ardoza was the complainant, and Gal-Lang presided.
*   **Warrant of Arrest:** A warrant of arrest was issued but not served. The accused filed a motion for reinvestigation and to recall the warrant.
*   **Hearing on Short Notice:** Judge Gal-Lang heard the motion to recall the warrant on the same day it was filed (December 13, 1995), despite Ardoza's objection and lack of proper notice as per Rule 15, ยง4 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Recall of Warrant:** Judge Gal-Lang granted the motion and recalled the warrant of arrest on December 14, 1995.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** Ardoza filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied. He alleges the order denying reconsideration was antedated.
*   **Dismissal of Criminal Case:** Subsequently, the underlying criminal case was dismissed based on a resolution by the Secretary of Justice.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Gal-Lang's Obligation:** To adhere to procedural rules, particularly Rule 15, ยง4 regarding notice of motions (three-day notice).
*   **Potential Liability (Judge Gal-Lang):** Misconduct.  *Rubenecia v. CSC, 244 SCRA 640* establishes the importance of due process, including notice and opportunity to be heard.
*   **Clerk of Court Grijaldo:** Alleged collusion and inducement of Ardoza to attend the hearing, but no evidence supported the claims.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Same-Day Hearing:** The most significant risk is the violation of Rule 15, ยง4 regarding the three-day notice.  The court acknowledged that the opposing party requires sufficient time to prepare for the hearing.
*   **Antedating of Order:** While the Court found it unlikely, the allegation of antedating the order raises questions of judicial integrity and potentially falsification.
*   **Lack of Prosecutor's Conformity:** The issue of whether the motion for reconsideration required the public prosecutor's conformity is raised, creating potential ambiguities related to private prosecution rights.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Rule 15, ยง4, Rules of Court:** Three-day notice requirement for motions.
*   ***Rubenecia v. CSC, 244 SCRA 640***: Defines the fundamental rule of due process.

**Outcome:**

*   Judge Gal-Lang was found **GUILTY** of misconduct and reprimanded with a warning.
*   The complaint against Clerk of Court Grijaldo was dismissed for lack of merit.

**Key Takeaways for Lawyer:**

This case highlights the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules, particularly regarding notice. The judge's attempt at procedural shortcuts, even with a perceived justification (subsequent dismissal of the underlying case), constituted misconduct. This serves as a warning against hastily disregarding due process requirements, even when perceived notions of justice are present. The potential for a charge of falsification in connection with the alleged antedating is also a factor to consider.
