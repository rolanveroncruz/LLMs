## Legal Document Summary: People v. Adobar, G.R. No. 222559

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the conviction of Aquila "Payat" Adobar for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (sale of dangerous drugs).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision, acquitting Adobar due to the prosecution's failure to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, specifically regarding the chain of custody and compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Section 5, Article II, RA 9165 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs - Methamphetamine Hydrochloride/Shabu)
*   **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the prosecution established an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs, proving the *corpus delicti* beyond a reasonable doubt.

    *   Core Issue: Non-compliance with Section 21, RA 9165 regarding the required witnesses during seizure, inventory and photography.

**Chain of Custody Deficiencies:**

*   **Witness Requirements:**  The law requires *immediate* inventory and photographing of the seized drugs *in the presence of* the accused (or representative), a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official.
    *   In this case, *none* of the three required witnesses (media, DOJ, elected official) were present at the time the drugs were allegedly confiscated.
    *   Only the Punong Barangay and media representative were present *later* during inventory, *after* the drugs were seized.  The absence of the DOJ representative was particularly noted, despite IO3 Tablate's conflicting account.
    *   This failure at the *initial* seizure point is critical, as it negates integrity and opens the door to evidence planting.
*   **Marking of Evidence:** Gap in the chain of custody because of the inconsistency in IO1 Siglos's testimony. There was no credible account of the subject drugs and IO1 Siglos did not account for the considerable lapse of time that the drugs were in her possession, creating a possibility of switching while the drugs were in her custody.
*   **Applicable Statute:** The Court applied RA 9165 and its IRR rather than RA 10640, as the former was more favorable to the accused at the time of the offense.

**Saving Clause Argument Rejection:**

*   The prosecution failed to meet the requirements to invoke the "saving clause" in the IRR of RA 9165, which allows for deviations from strict compliance with Section 21 under justifiable grounds.
*   The prosecution did not acknowledge or offer credible justification for the absence of the required witnesses at the seizure. Therefore, the second prong of the savings clause does not apply (integrity of drugs is proven), because compliance at the initial point is impossible to establish.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5:** Defines and penalizes the sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21:** Outlines the procedures for handling seized drugs (custody and disposition).
*   **IRR of RA 9165, Section 21(a):** Details requirements for physical inventory and photographing, *immediately after seizure*, and clarifies the "saving clause."
*   **People v. Dela Cruz:** Defines how compliance with Section 21 ensures the integrity of confiscated drugs. 
*   **People v. Mendoza:** Emphasizes the need for insulating witnesses to prevent evidence planting.
*   **People v. Beran:** Requires marking of seized drugs immediately upon confiscation *in the presence of the accused*.
*   **People v. Segundo:** Highlights extra caution needed when handling minuscule amounts of drugs, like the 0.03 grams involved.
*   **Numerous citations to emphasize the importance of strict compliance and the prosecution's burden of proving compliance:** People v. Cayas, People v. Umipang, People v. Gonzales.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **The phrase "immediately after seizure and confiscation"** in the statute is not clear on the logistics of securing presence of the required witnesses
*   **Escape of the Accused:** The court addressed that the accused's flight waives his right to be present, but *does not* excuse the requirement for other witnesses.
*   **Substantial vs. Strict Compliance:** The Court rejects the CA's interpretation of "substantial compliance" with Section 21, emphasizing that it's a matter of substantive law requiring *strict* adherence.

**Potential Risks/Implications for Law Enforcement:**

*   The decision reinforces the importance of *strict* adherence to Section 21, especially concerning the presence of *all* required witnesses at the *time of seizure*, emphasizing planning and preparation for buy-bust operations.
*   Failure to adequately explain *any* deviations from Section 21 can lead to acquittal, regardless of other evidence.
*   Heightened scrutiny is required in cases involving small amounts of drugs, necessitating meticulous adherence to procedures.
*   Establishes that the prosecution bears the burden of proving justifiable grounds for non-compliance.
