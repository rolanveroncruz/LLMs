**Case Summary: *People of the Philippines vs. Luis Aycardo* (G.R. No. 168299, October 6, 2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review of Court of Appeals Decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Luis Aycardo for three counts of Statutory Rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charges:** Three counts of Statutory Rape under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Section 5, Art. III of RA 7610 (Child Abuse Law).
*   **Victim:** AAA, appellant's niece, 9 years old at the time of the first offense, 10 during the subsequent offenses.
*   **Offense Elements:** Carnal knowledge of a girl under 12. Consent is immaterial.
*   **Penalty (Original):** Death penalty for each count.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant's Obligation:** To answer for the alleged crimes and present a credible defense.
*   **Finding:** Found guilty beyond reasonable doubt by the RTC and CA.
*   **Liabilities:** Civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.
*   **Penalty (Modified):** Reclusion Perpetua for each count, without eligibility for parole, due to RA 9346 (abolishing the death penalty). Payment of P75,000 as civil indemnity for each count of rape. Payment of P75,000 as moral damages for each count of rape. Payment of P25,000 as exemplary damages for each count of rape.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Appellant's Defense (Alibi):** Weak and inconsistent; not corroborated. Contradictory statements regarding dates/locations hurt his credibility.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** Explained by victim's fear due to threats and age. Delay, *per se*, does not negate credibility, especially with child victims.
*   **Motive (Land Dispute):** Defense argument that charges stemmed from land dispute. Rejected due to lack of independent corroborating evidence. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 335, Revised Penal Code (Rape):** Defines the crime and originally prescribed the death penalty.
*   **Section 5, Art. III of RA 7610 (Child Abuse Law):** Addresses child abuse, including rape.
*   **RA 7659 (Death Penalty Law):** Amended Art. 335, specifying qualifying circumstances (minority & relationship) for the death penalty in rape cases.
*   **RA 9346 (Abolition of Death Penalty):** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, replacing it with *reclusion perpetua* without parole.
*   **People v. Cabalquinto, G.R. No. 167693:** Justifies withholding the names of the victim.
*   **People v. Orbita, G.R. No. 172091, March 31, 2008.:** Justifies the increase of Civil indemnity to P75,000.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Inconsistent testimonies regarding dates/locations:** The appellant's inconsistent testimonies regarding his locations at the time of the crimes harmed the credibility of his alibi.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for statutory rape but modified the penalty to reclusion perpetua without parole due to the abolition of the death penalty. The court considered the victim's testimony credible, supported by medical evidence, and found the defense of alibi and alleged motive unconvincing. Civil indemnity, moral and exemplary damages were all also awarded.
