## Legal Document Summary: *Specified Contractors & Development, Inc. v. Pobocan*, G.R. No. 212472

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision and reinstate the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) dismissal of a complaint for specific performance.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in reversing the RTC's dismissal of the respondent's complaint for specific performance, considering potential issues of jurisdiction, prescription, and the Statute of Frauds.

**Facts:**

*   Respondent, former employee of Specified Contractors, claims an oral agreement with the company's chairman to receive one condominium unit for every building constructed as part of his compensation.
*   Respondent sought conveyance of two specific units (Xavierville Square Condominium, Unit 708, and Sunrise Holiday Mansion Bldg. I, Unit 208) upon retirement.
*   Petitioners denied the existence of the oral agreement and moved to dismiss based on the Statute of Frauds and prescription.

**RTC Ruling:** Granted the motion to dismiss based on the Statute of Frauds, finding that the alleged agreement should have been in writing.

**CA Ruling:** Reversed the RTC, holding that the Statute of Frauds only applies to executory contracts and that the agreement was partially performed based on respondent's possession, payment of dues, and alleged receipt of rental income.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** Granted the petition, reversed the CA, and reinstated the dismissal, but on the ground of *prescription*.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** Petitioners argued for the first time on appeal to the CA that the claim arose from an employer-employee relationship, thus falling under the jurisdiction of the labor arbiter. The Supreme Court held that the petitioners were estopped from raising this issue for the first time in the Motion for Reconsideration before the CA after actively participating in the proceedings before the RTC. Furthermore, the Court notes that the existence of the oral agreement is in dispute, distinguishing it from cases like Domondon v. NLRC where the agreement itself was not in question.
*   **Statute of Frauds (Article 1403(2), Civil Code):**  While argued initially, the Supreme Court ultimately did not rule on the applicability of the Statute of Frauds due to its decision on prescription. However, this remains a potential defense if the court had reached the merits of the case. Note that the CA considered acts of partial performance (possession, payment of dues, endorsement of furniture) to remove the contract from the Statute of Frauds. This is a contentious issue as Petitioners disputed the nature of the Respondent's possession.
*   **Prescription (Articles 1145, 1141, Civil Code):** The SC determined that the suit was for *specific performance* of an *oral contract* (a personal action, not a real action). As such, the prescriptive period is six years under Article 1145, not 30 years under Article 1141.  The court notes that Respondent's 2011 letter cites 1994 and 1999 as the years of the oral agreements, and CCTs for the units were issued in 1996 and 1997, far beyond the six-year window. Respondent's argument that the units had to exist for the obligation to arise was rejected citing Article 1347 which allows for agreements for future things, with developers engaging in preselling activities.
*   **Nature of Action:** The court emphasizes that the complaint's allegations and the relief sought define the nature of the action. The fact that the action is for specific performance to compel execution of deeds of conveyance makes the subsequent transfer an "anticipated consequence", instead of an action for ownership.

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   Petitioners had no obligation to convey the properties due to the action being time-barred.
*   Respondent has no legal recourse to enforce the alleged oral agreement.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Oral Agreement:** This case hinged on the existence of a credible oral agreement. The Statute of Frauds and prescription defenses highlighted the inherent risk in relying on unwritten contracts, making them difficult to prove, and subject to statutory bars.
*   **Estoppel:** The Supreme Court emphasized that Petitioners lost the chance to argue lack of jurisdiction before the RTC because they actively participated in the proceedings. This underscores the need to raise all possible defenses at the earliest opportunity.
*   **Facts in dispute:** The disagreement over whether partial performance occurred points to factual issues that would have required extensive discovery and trial if prescription had not been the deciding factor.
*   **Ambiguity of terms:** The term “industrial partners” in the 2011 letter could be interpreted in different ways, potentially weakening Respondent’s claim to a clear agreement on property conveyance.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Spouses Saraza v. Francisco* (722 Phil. 346): Differentiates between specific performance and real actions involving real property.
*   *Cabutihan v. Landcenter Construction & Development Corporation* (432 Phil. 927): Clarifies the distinction between actions for specific performance versus actions where a prayer for the execution of a deed of sale is incidental.
*   *Surviving Heirs of Alfredo R. Bautista v. Lindo* (728 Phil. 630): Lists specific performance as an action incapable of pecuniary estimation.
*   *National Steel Corporation v. Court of Appeals* (362 Phil. 150): Outlines when a party is estopped from questioning jurisdiction.
*   *Domondon v. NLRC* (508 Phil. 541):  Differentiated on the ground that the existence of the oral agreement was not in dispute.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court correctly reversed the CA's decision based on prescription, effectively foreclosing Pobocan's claim. However, the case serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of relying on oral agreements and the importance of diligently asserting all available defenses in a timely manner. While the merits of the oral contract were never definitively litigated, the inherent difficulties in proving such an agreement, coupled with legal defenses like the Statute of Frauds and prescription, make such claims highly precarious.
