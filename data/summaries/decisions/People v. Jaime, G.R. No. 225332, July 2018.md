**Case:** People v. Jaime, G.R. No. 225332 (2018)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed with modifications the CA decision, convicting Joel Jaime of Simple Rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353. The accused was found guilty of having carnal knowledge of the victim, AAA, a minor (15 years old at the time of the incident), through force and intimidation.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a), Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines rape as carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat, or intimidation. This is the crime the accused was ultimately convicted of.
*   **Section 5(b), Article III, RA 7610:** Addresses child prostitution and other sexual abuse. Initially, there was ambiguity regarding whether the charge should fall under this statute or the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Article 266-B, Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Sets the penalty for rape under Art. 266-A at *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** The Court clarifies its inapplicability to offenses punishable by *reclusion perpetua*.

**Obligations:**

*   The accused, Joel Jaime, has an obligation to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   The accused must pay the victim P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, with legal interest at 6% per annum from the date of finality of the decision until fully paid.

**Liabilities:**

*   The accused is criminally liable for the crime of rape.
*   The accused is civilly liable for damages to the victim.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Initial Confusion Regarding the Charge:** The information alleged elements of both rape under Art. 266-A and sexual abuse under RA 7610. The Court clarified that the prosecution's evidence sufficiently established rape, and the accused was convicted under the Penal Code, not the special law. This highlights a potential issue with the initial charging decision.
*   **Credibility of the Victim's Testimony:** The defense challenged the probability of the crime occurring in the described circumstances (inside a pedicab). The Court dismissed this argument, emphasizing that perverts "stop at nothing." This reinforces the significance of the victim's testimony.
*   **Applicability of Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Although the Court confirms the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* without parole, it also notes that parole eligibility is already excluded by law for this sentence.
*   **Immaterial Stipulated Testimony**: The defense challenges the materiality of the stipulated testimony. The Court affirms the testimony establishes the accused-appellant found inside the pedicab.

**Case Law References:**

*   **People v. Abay, 599 Phil. 390 (2009):** Addresses the distinction between rape under the Revised Penal Code and sexual abuse under RA 7610, clarifying that an accused cannot be charged with both for the same act. The case also states rape cannot be complexed with a violation of Section 5(b) of RA 7610 because a felony under the Revised Penal Code cannot be complexed with an offense by a special law.
*   **People v. Dahilig, 667 Phil. 92 (2011):** Similar to Abay, clarifies the distinction between rape and child abuse.
*   **People v. Battad, 740 Phil. 742 (2014):** Reaffirms that resistance is not an element of rape and emphasizes the victim's perception of force and intimidation.
*   **People v. Resurreccion, 609 Phil. 726 (2009):** Holds depraved individuals stop at nothing.
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016):** Establishes the standard amounts for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in rape cases where the penalty is *reclusion perpetua*.
