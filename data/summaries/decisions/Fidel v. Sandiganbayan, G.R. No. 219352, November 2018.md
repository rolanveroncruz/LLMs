**Legal Document Summary: *Fidel V. Anacta, Jr. vs. Sandiganbayan (Fifth Division) and People of the Philippines***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 219352, November 14, 2018 (843 Phil. 252)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Sandiganbayan's decision finding Petitioner guilty of unlawful appointments under Article 244 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 244, Revised Penal Code:** Unlawful appointments, penalizing a public officer who knowingly nominates or appoints to any public office any person lacking the legal qualifications.
*   **Section 6, Article IX-B, 1987 Constitution:** Prohibits the appointment of candidates who lost in any election to any office in the Government or GOCCs within one year after such election.
*   **Section 94(b), Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991):** Similar prohibition on appointment of losing candidates (except in *barangay* elections) to any government position within one year after the election.
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 198 ("Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973")**: Establishes local water districts as GOCCs, and clarifies who the appointing authority is.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner, then Mayor of Borongan, Eastern Samar, appointed Atty. Reynaldo A. Alconaba as a Director of the Borongan Water District (a GOCC).
*   Alconaba had lost a bid for municipal councilor in the immediately preceding May 2004 elections.
*   LWUA declared the appointment void due to the one-year prohibition.
*   Petitioner was charged under Article 244 RPC, in relation to the constitutional and statutory prohibitions.

**Sandiganbayan Ruling:**

*   Found Petitioner guilty.
*   Held that the appointment violated the one-year prohibition.
*   Rejected Petitioner's defense of reliance on the recommendation of the IBP chapter, as the power to appoint is discretionary.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   Affirmed the Sandiganbayan's decision.
*   Held that all elements of Article 244 RPC were present.

**Elements of the Crime & Court's Application:**

1.  **Public Officer:** Petitioner was the Mayor.
2.  **Appointed to Public Office:** Petitioner appointed Alconaba as Water District Director.
3.  **Lacked Legal Qualifications:** Alconaba was disqualified due to the one-year ban, following his election loss.
4.  **Knowledge of Disqualification:** The Court found that Petitioner was aware of Alconaba's disqualification. Petitioner was aware that Alconaba ran in May 2004. Further, as a long time public officer, Anacta acknowledged awareness of disqualification for losing candidates.

**Liabilities:**

*   Imprisonment of *arresto mayor* in its medium period (2 months and 1 day to 4 months).
*   Fine of P1,000.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Knowingly":** The key point of contention was whether the Petitioner *knowingly* appointed an unqualified person. The defense argued good faith reliance on the IBP. The prosecution was able to show that Anacta had knowledge of the one-year ban for losing candidates.
*   **"Legal Qualifications":** The Sandiganbayan, in its ruling, had previously attempted to argue legal disqualification as in distinction of temporary disqualifications (such as losing an election and then being given a spot in government within a year). The Supreme Court overruled this, and said there is no such distinction.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***People v. Sandiganbayan (Fourth Division), 581 Phil. 419 (2008)***: Affirmed that legal disqualification under Article 244 includes the temporary disqualification imposed by Section 6, Article IX-B of the Constitution and Section 94(b) of R.A. No. 7160.
*   ***Davao City Water District v. CSC, 278 Phil. 605 (1991)***: Categorically ruled that local water districts are government-owned or controlled corporations with original charter.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, emphasizing that Article 244 applies to temporary legal disqualifications, such as the one-year ban on appointments for losing candidates. The Mayor's personal awareness of this temporary ban was the critical piece of evidence, negating the argument for reasonable reliance on the IBP recommendation.
