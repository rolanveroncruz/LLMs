Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Daza v. Lugo*, G.R. No. 168999 (April 30, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals Decision reinstating the Civil Service Commission Regional Officer's Order.

**Facts:**

*   Ronan Lugo was appointed Sanitation Inspector I under permanent status.
*   Newly elected Governor Daza issued a memorandum directing department heads to evaluate probationary employees (including Lugo) to determine their fitness for permanent status.
*   Daza subsequently terminated Lugo's probationary service for "unsatisfactory conduct."
*   The CSC Regional Officer found the termination improper and ordered Lugo's reinstatement with back salaries.
*   The Civil Service Commission (CSC) reversed the Regional Officer's decision.
*   The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CSC, reinstating the Regional Officer's Order.

**Issue:**

Whether Lugo's probationary service was terminated with just cause.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition and affirmed the CA decision, finding that Lugo's services were terminated without just cause.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Revised Administrative Code of 1987, Sec. 26, par. 1, Chapter 5, Book V, Title I-A:** Probationary employees can only be dropped for "unsatisfactory conduct or want of capacity."
*   **Memorandum No. 352-01:** Daza's memorandum directed department heads/OICs, not individual employees, to submit performance evaluations. The CA correctly interpreted that supervisors were responsible for evaluating and submitting reports on their employees.
*   **Lack of Supporting Documentation:** Daza's termination notice lacked supporting documentation required by Civil Service Rules. No Performance Evaluation Report (PER) was submitted by Lugo's supervisor, nor were there other documents demonstrating unsatisfactory conduct.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Governor is liable for reinstatement of Lugo to his previous post with back salaries and other monetary benefits.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Risk of future similar actions leading to legal challenges and potential liability for back wages and damages if termination procedures are not properly followed.
*   Jeopardizing employee morale due to arbitrary or unsubstantiated termination.

**Case Law:**

*   *Miranda v. Carreon*, G.R. No. 143540 (April 11, 2003): While not directly on point, this case supports the principle that the probationary period must be adequate for evaluation and reinforces the need for due process.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of Memorandum No. 352-01 regarding the responsibility for submitting performance evaluations was the central contentious issue. The court sided with Lugo's interpretation, holding that the memo was not addressed to probationary employees themselves and should be directed to the department heads.
*   The lack of proof of 'unsatisfactory conduct' was contentious. Daza terminated Lugo's service for "unsatisfactory conduct" without providing documentation proving this and thus not complying with the correct procedures.

**Statutory References:**

*   Constitution, Art. IX-B, Sec. 2, paragraph 3 (Protection of civil service employees)
*   Revised Administrative Code of 1987, Sec. 26, par. 1, Chapter 5, Book V, Title I-A

**Conclusion:**

The case underscores the importance of following proper procedures and having sufficient justification when terminating probationary employees. It emphasizes the need for clear communication of responsibilities and documenting performance issues before termination.
