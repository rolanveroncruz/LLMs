## Legal Document Summary: A.C. No. 6943

**Case:** *Atty. Godofredo C. Manipud vs. Atty. Feliciano M. Bautista*

**Nature:** Disbarment complaint against Atty. Bautista for alleged forum shopping, violation of attorney's oath, Canon 1, Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and improper conduct.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Forum Shopping:** Atty. Bautista filed two complaints for annulment of real estate mortgage (Civil Case Nos. 2005-0107-D & 2005-0253-D) on behalf of his client, the mortgagor Jovita de Macasieb. Complainant Atty. Manipud, the mortgagee, alleges both complaints contained the same allegations, parties, subject matter, facts, issues, and sought the same relief.
*   **Impostor and Deceased Party:** Complainant alleges that Atty. Bautista conspired with an impostor, signing the complaint as "Jovita Macasieb" instead of the deceased "Jovita de Macasieb". Complainant claims Jovita de Macasieb died in 1968. Atty. Bautista notarized the documents.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Atty. Bautista claimed the second complaint was filed in a "desperate attempt" to restrain the sale of his client's property. He argued he disclosed the pending first complaint in the certificate of non-forum shopping and in the body of the second complaint. He claimed good faith and filed a Motion to Withdraw.

**IBP Findings and Recommendation:**

*   The IBP found Atty. Bautista *not* administratively liable for forum shopping. They reasoned there was no showing that the filing of the second complaint was deliberate or willful. The Investigating Commissioner found he acted in good faith, as he disclosed the first complaint and seemingly believed the second foreclosure application was new.
*   The IBP specifically found that the raising of the deceased party/impersonation issue was raised too late in proceedings.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court *Affirmed* the IBP's Resolution dismissing the complaint against Atty. Bautista.
*   The Court agreed with the IBP that the charge was only related to forum shopping. The issue of the alleged impersonation and deceased party was not raised sufficiently early in the proceedings and was therefore not properly before the IBP or the Court.
*   The Court additionally noted that the complainant failed to properly assail the IBP findings on the issue of forum shopping.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Canon 1, Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** This is cited as the provision allegedly violated by Atty. Bautista. This rule generally pertains to upholding the law and not engaging in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.
*   **Rule 7, Section 5 of the Rules of Court:** This rule concerns the certification against forum shopping and the disclosure of pending or related actions.
*   **Municipality of Taguig, et al vs. Court of Appeals** is referenced for the definition of the nature of forum shopping.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Limited Scope of Inquiry:** The Court's decision hinged heavily on the limited scope of the IBP investigation. While the complaint initially alleged a broader range of misconduct, the proceedings became focused on the forum shopping charge. This potentially shielded Atty. Bautista from scrutiny on the impersonation issue.
*   **Good Faith vs. Negligence:** The IBP's reliance on Atty. Bautista's "good faith" in filing the second complaint could be a point of contention. While disclosure of the pending case mitigates the *intent* to deceive, it might not excuse negligence in failing to adequately assess the situation. Arguably, a lawyer has a duty to investigate the basis of his client's claims.
*   **Impersonation Issue:** Although the IBP and Court focused on Forum Shopping, the matter of the imposter is still a pressing concern. The ruling effectively shields Atty. Bautista by procedure, rather than exonerating him of possible collusion with an imposter.

**Legal Advice:**

*   The Complainant cannot appeal this case again. They can file a separate complaint specifically focusing on the issue of the impersonation of the deceased person.
*   The Court notes that the Complainant can file a case of Falsification and Perjury against the Imposter.
*   Carefully analyze the facts surrounding the mortgagor's death and the circumstances under which the complaints were filed. Determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a claim of knowing involvement or reckless disregard on the part of Atty. Bautista.
*   If there is evidence of direct involvement, consider filing a separate complaint focusing specifically on the alleged misrepresentation and ethical breaches related to the death party, highlighting violations of Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and possibly other ethical rules related to candor and integrity.
