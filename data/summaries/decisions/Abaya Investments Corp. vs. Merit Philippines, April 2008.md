**Legal Document Summary: *Abaya Investments Corporation vs. Merit Philippines and Dominise***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that reversed the Regional Trial Court (RTC) and Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC) rulings in an unlawful detainer case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** A commercial lease agreement existed between Abaya Investments (lessor) and Merit Philippines (lessee) for the "Carmen Building," with a specific clause prohibiting subleasing.
*   **Breach of Contract:** Alleged breaches included failure to pay rent and illegal subleasing to a computer gaming entity.
*   **Demand Letters:** Abaya Investments sent multiple demand letters to Merit Philippines, demanding payment of arrearages, termination of the sublease, and ultimately, vacating the premises.
*   **Ejectment Complaint:** Abaya Investments filed an unlawful detainer complaint with the MTC based on non-payment of rent and illegal subleasing (Section 1, Rule 70, Rules of Court).
*   **Vacation of Premises:** Merit Philippines vacated the premises during the pendency of the case.

**Obligations:**

*   **Lessee (Merit Philippines):** Obligated to pay rent, refrain from subleasing without consent, and vacate upon termination of the lease.
*   **Lessor (Abaya Investments):**  Entitled to receive rent, enforce the no-subleasing clause, and regain possession upon lawful termination.

**Liabilities/Damages:**

*   The MTC initially awarded Php 482,885.02 (unpaid rentals, interest, etc.) and Php 20,000.00 (attorney's fees). The RTC modified it to remove the award of damages. Ultimately, the Supreme Court reinstated the amounts from the MTC decision.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** The CA erroneously determined that the case was actually for rescission of contract, which would place it outside the MTC's jurisdiction. The SC rightly corrected this error clarifying that the main cause was unlawful detainer.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1673, Civil Code:** Allows lessor to eject lessee for non-payment of rent or breach of contract.
*   **Section 2, Rule 70, Rules of Court:** Requirements for unlawful detainer actions, including demand to vacate.

**Case Law:**

*   **Nera v. Vacante & Zulueta v. Mariano:**  Distinguished by the Supreme Court. These cases involved contracts to sell, not leases, and therefore required prior rescission, which is irrelevant in this case of unlawful detainer due to the grounds stipulated in Article 1673 of the Civil Code.
*   **Dayao v. Shell Company of the Philippines, Ltd.:**  Supports the view that a lessor can seek both rescission and ejectment in a single action.
*   **Fuentebella v. Castro, Shipside Inc. v. Court of Appeals, Benguet Corporation v. Cordillera Caraballo Mission, Inc, China Banking Corporation v. Mondragon International Philippines, Inc.:** These cases addressed issues related to certification against forum shopping, specifically authorization to sign on behalf of corporations, and demonstrate a trend toward relaxing procedural requirements in the interest of justice, particularly when ratification occurs.

**Outcome:**

*   Supreme Court **reversed** the CA decision and **reinstated** the RTC decision, affirming the MTC ruling in favor of Abaya Investments.  The Court found the CA's jurisdictional analysis erroneous and upheld the ejectment complaint's validity.

**Key Takeaway:**

The unlawful detainer action was proper based on the lease agreement breaches. The Supreme Court's decision reinforced the right of a lessor to eject a lessee for non-payment of rent or violation of lease terms, without necessarily requiring prior rescission. The Court also signals a flexibility regarding procedural defects of corporate authorization provided that the purpose of the requirement is not circumvented and the defects are subsequently ratified.
