## Legal Document Summary: Republic v. Heirs of Ignacio Daquer

**Case:** Republic of the Philippines v. Heirs of Ignacio Daquer and the Register of Deeds, Province of Palawan (G.R. No. 193657, September 04, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's denial of the Republic's Complaint for Cancellation of Free Patent, Original Certificate of Title, and Reversion of land.

**Key Issue:** Whether the mere issuance of a homestead patent classifies unclassified public land as alienable and disposable, and whether Homestead Patent No. V-67820 was jurisdictionally defective.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court **GRANTS** the Petition, **REVERSING** the Court of Appeals decision. The land is **REVERTED** to the Republic of the Philippines, and the Original Certificate of Title is **CANCELLED**.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Public Land Act (Act No. 2874):** Governs the classification and disposition of public lands. Emphasizes that the Governor-General (now the President), upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (now DENR), has the exclusive power to classify lands of the public domain.
*   **Homestead Patent:** A gratuitous grant of disposable agricultural land to land-destitute citizens. Strict compliance with legal requirements is mandatory.
*   **Classification Requirement:** Public land must be **positively** classified as alienable and disposable before it can be subject to a homestead application. This requires a **direct and express** act of the government, not merely inferred.  *Republic v. Vega, 654 Phil. 521,511 (2011).* A positive act is an act which clearly and positively manifests the intention to declassify lands of the public domain into alienable and disposable *AMADO D. AQUINO, LAND REGISTRATION AND RELATED PROCEEDINGS 42 (4th ed., 2007).*
*   **Burden of Proof:** The applicant bears the burden of proving the land is alienable and disposable. Failure to do so results in the presumption that the land is inalienable public domain *Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources v. Yap, 589 Phil. 156, 182-183 (2008).*
*   **No Automatic Reclassification:** Issuance of a homestead patent alone does not automatically reclassify unclassified land as alienable agricultural land. *Chavez v. Public Estates Authority, 433 Phil. 506 (2002)* is distinguished, as that case involved a presidential decree expressly transferring reclaimed lands.
*   **Unclassified Land:**  The lower courts erroneously relied on *Krivenko v. Register of Deeds, 79 Phil. 461 (1947)* to presume unclassified land as agricultural. The Supreme Court cites *Heirs of the late Spouses Palanca v. Republic, 531 Phil. 602 (2006)*, stating that unclassified lands, until released and rendered open to disposition, are considered inalienable lands of the public domain.
*   **Indefeasibility of Title:** While titles issued pursuant to homestead patents become indefeasible after one year, this rule does not apply if the land was inalienable public land at the time of the grant.  The State can file an action for reversion even after registration. *Republic v. Ramos, 117 Phil. 45 (1963)*

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Heirs of Daquer:** Obligation to surrender possession and title to the Republic. Liable to have OCT No. G-3287 cancelled.
*   **Register of Deeds:** Obligation to cancel OCT No. G-3287.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Property:** The Heirs of Daquer lose their claim to the land and any improvements made.
*   **Precedent:** Reinforces the State's right to revert erroneously granted public lands.
*   **Further Litigation:**  Potential for disputes regarding compensation for improvements made on the land prior to reversion.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The lower court's interpretation of the land classification map, arguing that areas outside alienable and disposable zones are not necessarily unclassified public forests, but rather simply unclassified land.  This interpretation is directly refuted by the Supreme Court.

**Statutory References:**

*   Act No. 2874 (Public Land Act)
*   Presidential Decree No. 1085
*   Presidential Decree No. 1529
*   Commonwealth Act 141
*   1987 Constitution, Article XII, Section 2

*   Agne v. Director of Lands, 261 Phil. 13 (1990)
*   Mendoza v. Navarette, 288 Phil. 1122 (1992)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision clarifies that a positive act of the government is required to classify public land as alienable and disposable. The mere issuance of a homestead patent, without such prior classification, is insufficient to transfer ownership. This reinforces the State's right to recover erroneously granted public land, even after the issuance of a title.
