## Legal Document Summary: *Espina v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 97903 (1998)*

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision

**Subject Matter:** Eligibility for Board of Directors membership in an electric cooperative (LEYECO IV), specifically regarding *bona fide* membership requirements.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 21 of P.D. No. 269 (NEA Charter):** Requires cooperative members to (1) agree to use services furnished by the cooperative and (2) meet qualifications prescribed by the by-laws.
*   **LEYECO IV By-Laws, Section 1:** Defines membership requirements: (a) written application, (b) agreement to purchase electricity, (c) agreement to comply with the articles of incorporation and by-laws, (d) payment of membership fee, and (e) acceptance by the Board of Directors.
*   **LEYECO IV By-Laws, Sections 3 & 4:** Joint membership is only allowed for Husband & Wife.
*   **Section 24 of P.D. No. 269:** Restricts Board of Directors to members of the cooperative.
*   **LEYECO IV Election Code ยง48(17):** Votes cast for disqualified candidates are considered stray votes.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Applicant:** Must meet all membership requirements as outlined in P.D. No. 269 and LEYECO IV's by-laws, including formal application and payment of fees.
*   **LEYECO IV:** Obligated to adhere to P.D. No. 269 and its by-laws regarding membership qualifications and eligibility for Board membership.
*   **NEA:** Has supervisory power over electric cooperatives, but its decisions must conform to law and regulations.
*   **Member:** Should be a consumer whose membership is verified with a certificate.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguous Membership:** The Court found that Miguel Cotiamco used Carmen Cotiamco's membership number to receive services, but did not have his own membership. This raises issues about the potential for improper use of cooperative resources.
*   **Erroneous Application of Estoppel:** The Court of Appeals and NEA erroneously applied estoppel, which cannot be used to circumvent requirements of law, in this case Sec. 24 of P.D. 269.
*   **Lack of Due Process Argument:** Although the petitioner raised the due process claim, this claim was unsuccessful as he did have the opportunity to respond to the motion by respondent.
*   **Mootness:** The case was ultimately dismissed as moot because the director's term had expired.

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 269 (P.D. No. 269) - Charter of the National Electrification Administration (NEA)

**Case Law Implications:**

*   Confirms that the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies admits of exceptions.
*   Highlights that estoppel cannot be used to legalize acts that violate laws or by-laws.
*   Illustrates the NEA's supervisory role but emphasizes that its decisions are subject to judicial review and must be in accordance with the law.

**Areas for Further Investigation:**

*   The exact nature of the relationship between Miguel and Carmen Cotiamco and whether it justified the use of a single membership.
*   The cooperative's record-keeping practices and whether they contributed to the confusion regarding membership status.
*   The implications of using an "industrial consumer" designation when assessing membership qualifications.
