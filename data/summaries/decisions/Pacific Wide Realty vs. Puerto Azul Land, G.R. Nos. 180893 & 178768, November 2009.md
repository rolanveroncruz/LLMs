## Legal Document Summary: *Pacific Wide Realty and Development Corporation v. Puerto Azul Land, Inc.*

**Case:** Consolidated petitions concerning a corporate rehabilitation proceeding initiated by Puerto Azul Land, Inc. (PALI).

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Rehabilitation Plan:** Approved, despite creditor opposition, due to feasibility and lack of manifest unreasonableness.
    *   Terms included 50% principal reduction, condonation of accrued interest/penalties, and restructuring with low-interest rates.
    *   Court upheld debt restructuring as a valid rehabilitation tool under the Interim Rules on Corporate Rehabilitation.
*   **Non-Impairment Clause:** Rejected as basis for challenging the plan. No law was impairing contracts. Further, the exercise of police power for the common good (successful rehabilitation) overrides this clause. *Oposa v. Factoran, Jr.* cited.
*   **Stay Order & Accommodation Mortgagor:** The RTC *validly* lifted the stay order to allow foreclosure by Pacific Wide Realty and Development Corporation (PWRDC) on property owned by Ternate Utilities, Inc. (TUI), an accommodation mortgagor. The CA was reversed on this point.
    *   Rationale: PALI (and TUI) failed to pay realty taxes, violating a pre-existing agreement (Mortgage Trust Indenture or MTI) and jeopardizing the secured creditor's (PWRDC) position. PWRDC lacked “adequate protection.”
    *   Reference: Section 12, Rule 4 of the Interim Rules on Corporate Rehabilitation, now superseded but applicable at the time. Note also that the current Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation explicitly *excludes* property not belonging to a debtor under corporate rehabilitation from the stay order, but ensures the guarantor's right to excussion.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 902-A (PD 902-A):** Section 6(c) mandates suspension of actions against companies under management or receivership, but the Court found an exception was justified here.

**Obligations:**

*   **PALI:** Obligated to adhere to the terms of the approved rehabilitation plan and cooperate with the rehabilitation receiver.
*   **Rehabilitation Receiver:** Duty to implement the plan, monitor PALI's compliance, and report any material changes to the court.
*   **TUI (Accommodation Mortgagor):** Originally obligated to pay the real property taxes. Failure led to lifting of the stay order and risk of foreclosure

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **PALI:** Continued risk of liquidation if the rehabilitation plan fails. Faces potential legal challenges from creditors if compliance is not maintained.
*   **PWRDC:** Could face challenges if foreclosure proceeds are deemed to prejudice the rehabilitation effort significantly, though this is unlikely given the Court's ruling.

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 902-A, as amended, Section 6(c)
*   Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation, Section 5, Section 12 Rule 4
*   Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation, Section 7(b), Rule 3
*   Constitution, Article III, Section 10

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Adequacy of Creditor Protection:** The assessment of “adequate protection” under Section 12, Rule 4 of the Interim Rules is inherently subjective and fact-dependent, leaving room for disagreement.
*   **Balancing Interests:** The tension between the need to rehabilitate the debtor and the rights of secured creditors remains a contentious point, especially regarding the extent to which a rehabilitation plan can alter contractual obligations.

**Case Law References:**

*   *Oposa v. Factoran, Jr.* (Police Power trumps Non-Impairment Clause)
*   *Negros Navigation Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (Purpose of rehabilitation)
