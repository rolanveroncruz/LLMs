## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Magsano* (G.R. No. 231050)

**Case Overview:** This is an appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Roy Magsano for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of Article II of RA 9165, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the CA decision and *acquitted* Magsano.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Charges:** Illegal sale (0.10g methamphetamine hydrochloride) and illegal possession (0.09g methamphetamine hydrochloride)
*   **Prosecution's Argument:** Buy-bust operation leading to arrest of Magsano. Drugs seized, inventoried (with Brgy. Kagawad present), and later found positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride.
*   **Defense's Argument:** Denial, alleging forced entry and planting of evidence by police.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty on both counts. Found unbroken chain of custody.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC. Chain of custody deemed adequate. Failure to raise procedural issues at trial waived the argument on appeal.
*   **SC Ruling:** Acquittal due to *unjustified deviation from Section 21, Article II of RA 9165*. Specifically, *absence of representatives from the media and DOJ during the inventory of seized drugs*. No justifiable explanation offered for this non-compliance. This failure casts reasonable doubt on the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sections 5 and 11, Article II:** Defines and penalizes illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 10640 (Amendment to RA 9165):** Amended Section 21 to include specific requirements for inventory of seized drugs, including the presence of media and DOJ representatives.
*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 (as amended):** Chain of custody rule; requires immediate inventory and photograph of seized items in the presence of the accused, an elected public official, and a representative from the National Prosecution Service (DOJ) OR the media.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Emphasizes the importance of the presence of media or DOJ representatives during the seizure and marking of drugs.
*   **People v. Almorfe, 631 Phil. 51 (2010):** Saving clause in RA 9165 (non-compliance with Sec. 21 requirements may be excused) requires proof of justifiable grounds for non-compliance and preservation of the integrity of the evidence.
*   **People v. De Guzman, 630 Phil. 637 (2010):** Justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, not presumed.
*   **People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671, January 31, 2018:** Failure to raise objections to chain of custody at trial does not preclude the appellate court from considering the issue.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Law Enforcement:** Strict adherence to Section 21 of RA 9165 when handling seized drugs to preserve integrity of evidence. Obligation to secure the presence of required witnesses (elected public official, DOJ/NPS representative, media representative) during inventory.
*   **Prosecution:** Positive duty to prove compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165, justifying any deviations from the prescribed procedure.
*   **Accused:** No obligation to raise chain of custody issues at trial. Such issues may be considered on appeal.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Unjustified Non-Compliance with RA 9165:** Failure to secure the presence of media and DOJ representatives creates a significant risk of evidence suppression.
*   **Lack of Justification:** Without a sufficient explanation for deviations from Section 21, the prosecution risks failing to establish the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs.
*   **Appellate Review:** Even if chain of custody issues are not raised at trial, appellate courts retain the power to review the issue, ensuring the integrity of criminal proceedings.
*   **Ambiguity:** The "saving clause" in Section 21 allows for non-compliance under "justifiable grounds," but the interpretation and application of this clause are fact-specific and require strong evidentiary support.
* **"Planting" of Evidence:** Non-compliance with Section 21 raises the risk of evidence tampering.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "justifiable grounds" exception in Section 21, Article II. The burden is on the prosecution to demonstrate the reasons for non-compliance and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were properly preserved. The *Magsano* case highlights that the courts will closely scrutinize these justifications.

**Conclusion:**

The *Magsano* decision reinforces the strict adherence to Section 21 of RA 9165 and the importance of maintaining the integrity of drug evidence. The acquittal underscores the high burden on the prosecution to demonstrate compliance with the statute and its implementing regulations. Law enforcement should be meticulous in following the chain of custody requirements, particularly regarding the required witnesses during inventory, and the prosecution must be prepared to justify any deviations.
