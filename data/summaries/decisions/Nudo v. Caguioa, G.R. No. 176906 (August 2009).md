**Legal Document Summary: Nudo v. Caguioa, G.R. No. 176906 (2009)**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a Petition for Annulment of Judgment.

**Background:**

*   Spouses Petronilo and Marcela Nudo (Plaintiffs/Respondents) filed a complaint for partition and damages (Civil Case No. 3493) against spouses Gumersindo and Zosima Nudo (Defendants).  The suit concerned a parcel of land co-owned by Petronilo and Gumersindo.
*   Gumersindo Nudo died during the pendency of the case.  No formal substitution of heirs occurred.
*   RTC rendered judgment ordering partition in favor of Plaintiffs.
*   Defendants appealed, but the CA dismissed the appeal for failure to file appellants' brief.  Entry of judgment followed.
*   Zosima Nudo died after the CA decision became final.
*   Plaintiffs sought execution.  Alias writs of execution were issued but remained unenforced.
*   Andrew Nudo (Petitioner), son of the deceased defendants, filed a Petition for Annulment of Judgment arguing lack of substitution of heirs invalidated the RTC decision.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Grounds for Annulment (Rule 47, Section 2):** The Supreme Court reiterated that the *only* grounds for annulment of judgment are extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction.
*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** Limited to lack of jurisdiction over the person or subject matter.
*   **Non-Substitution of Heirs:** The Court held that the *failure to substitute the heirs of a deceased party is NOT a jurisdictional defect* but a matter of due process. *Napere v. Barbarona, G.R. No. 160426*.
*   **Due Process:** Due process is violated *only* if the deceased party is not represented by *any* legal representative or heir.
*   **Representation:** The Court found that the original defendants (Gumersindo and Zosima) were represented by counsel throughout the proceedings. Furthermore, Zosima continued as a party after Gumersindo's death.
*   **Finality:** The CA judgment (affirming the RTC decision) became final and executory *before* Zosima Nudo's death.
*   **Successor-in-Interest:** Sec. 7(b), Rule 39 of the Rules of Civil Procedure allows execution against the successor-in-interest of a deceased judgment obligor, if the judgment concerns recovery of property.  Andrew Nudo, as a successor-in-interest, is bound by the judgment.
*   **Laches/Waiver:** The Court implied that Andrew Nudo and his siblings were aware of the ongoing litigation. It expressed disbelief at his claim of ignorance and noted his sister's awareness of the judgment during enforcement attempts. The Court reasoned to allow annulment would reward inaction and negligence of the heirs.

**Obligations:**

*   Andrew Nudo, as a successor-in-interest to Gumersindo and Zosima Nudo, is obligated to comply with the RTC judgment for partition.
*   Andrew Nudo is obligated not to interfere with the execution of the partition judgment.

**Liabilities:**

*   Andrew Nudo is potentially liable for costs associated with the unsuccessful Petition for Annulment of Judgment.
*   Potential liability exists for hindering or obstructing the execution of the judgment for partition.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute over Knowledge:** The Court found that the Nudo children likely knew of the Partition suit before the execution of the judgment. It's possible that the case could be reversed if evidence supports the claim that the children were unaware of the pending matter.
*   **Due Process Argument (Weak):** While the Court explicitly states non-substitution is a due process issue, the argument may be revived if compelling evidence arises demonstrating a lack of representation, potentially affecting all heirs interests, during the process.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 47, Section 2, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Grounds for annulment of judgment.
*   **Rule 39, Section 7(b), Rules of Civil Procedure:** Execution against successor-in-interest.
*   *Veneracion v. Mancilla, G.R. No. 158238, July 20, 2006:* Annulment of judgment is an extraordinary remedy.
*   *Tolentino v. Leviste, G.R. No. 156118,November 19, 2004:* Definition of lack of jurisdiction in annulment cases.
*   *Napere v. Barbarona, G.R. No. 160426, January 31, 2008:* Non-substitution of heirs is not jurisdictional.

**Recommendation:**

The Petitioner's claim for annulment is weak based on the decision. Given the Court's finding that the heirs were represented (even indirectly) and that the judgment was final before the last parent's death, a reversal on appeal is unlikely. The better strategy might be to negotiate a settlement with the respondents regarding the partition. Further investigation is needed to assess the validity of the court's findings as to the heir's previous knowledge of the claim.
