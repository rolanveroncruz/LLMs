## Legal Document Summary - *Magnaye v. Legarto*, A.C. No. 10110

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against Atty. Mary Ann C. Legarto, a former HLURB Arbiter.

**Complainant:** Edgardo C. Magnaye (and the Homeowners of New Mahogany Village).

**Respondent:** Atty. Mary Ann C. Legarto.

**Key Issue:** Whether Atty. Legarto should be held administratively liable for irregularities in HLURB Case No. RIV-050213-0633, specifically:

1.  Issuance of a Cease and Desist Order (CDO) without sufficient basis and prematurely.
2.  Granting a motion to declare Magnaye *et al.* in contempt without a hearing or opportunity to oppose.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court partially adopted the IBP's findings and recommendations, finding Atty. Legarto **GUILTY** of:

1.  **Simple Negligence:** For failing to require the CDO applicant (Paronda) to post a bond, violating HLURB rules (Rule 21, Section 77).  Cited *In Re: Complaint to Aero Engr. Reci Against CA Marquez and DCA Bahia Relative to Crim. Case No. 05-236956*. Penalty: PHP 35,000 fine. Violates Canon VI, Section 34(b) of the CPRA
2.  **Gross Ignorance of the Law (Attended by Bad Faith/Corrupt Motive):** For issuing the contempt order against Magnaye *et al.* without a hearing or opportunity to oppose, and for relying on allegations and proof not presented in the motion.  Violates basic due process and principles established in *Salinas v. Bitas*. Penalty: Suspension from practice of law for six months and one day. Violates Canon VI, Section 33(h) of the CPRA.
3.  **Willful and Deliberate Disobedience to Orders:** For failing to file comments and attend IBP proceedings. Penalty: PHP 35,000 fine. Violates Canon VI, Section 34(c) of the CPRA.

**Key Provisions/Obligations Violated:**

*   **Rule 21, Section 77 of the 2011 Revised Rules of Procedure of the HLURB:** Mandating a bond for CDOs.
*   **Due Process Requirements:**  Right to notice and hearing before being held in contempt. Cites Rules of Court (suppletorily applicable) and *Salinas v. Bitas*.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA):** Canon VI re Negligence and Ignorance of Law.

**Liabilities:**

*   Monetary fines: PHP 35,000 for simple negligence, PHP 35,000 for disobedience to the Supreme Court and IBP's orders.
*   Suspension from the practice of law for six months and one day.
*   Stern warning against future similar conduct.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdictional Question:** The Court initially grappled with whether it had jurisdiction over acts committed in Atty. Legarto's capacity as a government lawyer. The Court ultimately determined it had jurisdiction based on the *Guevarra-Castil v. Atty. Trinidad* test: did the malfeasance render the lawyer unfit to practice?
*   **Subjectivity in "Bad Faith/Corrupt Motive":**  The finding of "bad faith/corrupt motive" in the contempt order, while supported by procedural irregularities, relies somewhat on inference.
*   **Impact of the 2019 Amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure:** The decision references both pre- and post-2019 amendment versions of the Rules, implying that even under the amended rules (discretionary hearing), the lack of *any* opportunity to oppose the motion was fatal.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 9904 (Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations)
*   Presidential Decree No. 1216
*   Rules of Court, Rule 15 (Motions)
*   2011 Revised Rules of Procedure of the HLURB
*   Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability

**Case Law:**

*   *Guevarra-Castil v. Atty. Trinidad* (Jurisdiction over government lawyers)
*   *Castro v. Atty. Barin* (Presumption of regularity)
*   *Tallado v. Judge Dating* (Judicial remedies)
*   *Tabuzo v. Atty. Gomos* (Judicial Remedies)
*   *In Re: Complaint to Aero Engr. Reci Against CA Marquez and DCA Bahia Relative to Crim. Case No. 05-236956* (Dereliction of Duty)
*   *Salinas v. Bitas* (Contempt procedures)
*   *In Re: Supreme Court (First Division) Notice of Judgment dated December 14, 2011 in G.R. No. 188376 v. Atty. Mi√±as* (Gross Ignorance of the Law)
*   *Kelley v. Atty. Robielos* (Disobedience)

**Conclusion:** Atty. Legarto's actions, particularly the contempt order without due process, constitute serious violations that warrant disciplinary action. The decision highlights the importance of adhering to procedural rules and providing fundamental fairness, even in administrative proceedings.
