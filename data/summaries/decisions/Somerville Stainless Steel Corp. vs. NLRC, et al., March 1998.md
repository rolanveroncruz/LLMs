## Legal Document Summary: Somerville Stainless Steel Corporation v. NLRC and Jerry Macandog, et al. (G.R. No. 125887)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing NLRC Resolutions affirming Labor Arbiter's decision regarding illegal retrenchment.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Issue:** Validity of the retrenchment of private respondents.
*   **Art. 283 Labor Code:** Defines authorized causes for termination, including retrenchment to prevent losses. Requires written notice to worker and DOLE one month prior.
*   **Requirements for Valid Retrenchment:**
    *   Substantial losses, not de minimis (citing *Lopez Sugar Corporation vs. Federation of Free Workers*).
    *   Reasonably imminent loss perceived in good faith.
    *   Retrenchment reasonably necessary and likely to prevent the losses; it should be a last resort (citing *Edge Apparel, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission*).
    *   Alleged losses must be proved by sufficient and convincing evidence.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's Burden of Proof:** The employer bears the burden of proving the existence or imminence of substantial losses and the reasonable necessity of retrenchment to avoid such losses. Failure to do so results in a finding of unjustified dismissal (citing *San Miguel Jeepney Service vs. NLRC*).
*   **Separation Pay & 13th Month Pay:** Ordered by the Labor Arbiter, and affirmed by the NLRC, based on Annex "A" of the decision.
*   **Backwages and Damages:** Labor arbiter awarded P30,000 each as backwages and damages to each complainant.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Insufficient Evidence of Losses:** Court found that the employer failed to provide sufficient proof of substantial losses. The single financial statement provided was insufficient as it didn't show the trend of losses over time.
*   **Lack of Reasonable Necessity:** The Court determined that the retrenchment was not reasonably necessary, as the employer had not exhausted less drastic measures to avert losses (e.g., reducing expenses) and their argument regarding the strike impacting income was mere speculation.
*   **Good Faith:** The court rejected the employer's claim that the retrenchment was done in good faith, noting it occurred after a strike notice was filed due to unpaid CBA benefits.
*   **Roberto Goce's Case:**  His name did not appear on the list of employees. The court remanded his complaint back to the Labor Arbiter to determine if there was sufficient evidence to conclude he was an employee.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Lopez Sugar Corporation vs. Federation of Free Workers* (189 SCRA 179): Established standards for proving substantial loss in retrenchment.
*   *Edge Apparel, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission*: Retrenchment as a measure of last resort.
*   *San Miguel Jeepney Service vs. NLRC*: Reiterates the employer's burden of proof.
*   *Guerrero vs. National Labor Relations Commission* (261 SCRA 301): Mere speculation about the impact of a strike is insufficient proof of losses necessitating retrenchment.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "substantial loss" is fact-dependent.  The court emphasizes that not every loss justifies retrenchment and requires a showing that the losses were "substantial, continuing, and without any immediate prospect of abating."
*   The determination of whether all other less drastic measures have been exhausted is subjective and open to interpretation by the Labor Arbiter and NLRC.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, affirming the NLRC's finding of illegal retrenchment due to insufficient proof of substantial losses and a lack of reasonable necessity.  The case highlights the high burden of proof on employers seeking to justify retrenchment and the Court's scrutiny of claimed losses and alternative measures. The Roberto Goce case was remanded to the Labor Arbiter for further determination of employment status.
