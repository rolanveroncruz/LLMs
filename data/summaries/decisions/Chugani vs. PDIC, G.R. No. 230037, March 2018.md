**Case Summary: *Spouses Chugani v. PDIC***

**Citation:** 828 Phil. 538 (2018)

**Issue:** Whether the CA correctly ruled that the RTC lacked jurisdiction over the Petition for Certiorari questioning PDIC's denial of deposit insurance, and whether the PDIC committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the claims.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision, holding that the RTC lacked jurisdiction and that the PDIC did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying the claims.

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3591 (PDIC Charter), as amended by RA 9576 and RA 10846:** Defines PDIC's powers, including granting/denying deposit insurance claims. Sec. 4(f) defines "deposit" and lists exclusions from insurance coverage (investment products, fraudulent deposits, unsound banking practices, proceeds of unlawful activity).
*   **RA 10846, Sec. 7:** Explicitly grants the Court of Appeals (CA) jurisdiction over petitions for certiorari questioning PDIC's actions taken under Section 5(g) (relating to denied deposit insurance claims).
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Remedy for questioning PDIC decisions is through a Petition for Certiorari to the CA, based on grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.
*   **PDIC Regulatory Issuance No. 2011-02, Sec. 2(d):** Establishes requirements for a deposit to be considered legitimate for insurance purposes (received in the usual course of business, recorded in bank books, opened per BSP/PDIC requirements).

**Obligations:**

*   **PDIC:** To grant or deny claims based on their charter, rules and regulations.
*   **Depositors:** To ensure deposits meet the criteria for valid/legitimate deposits under PDIC rules and regulations.

**Liabilities:**

*   The SC affirmed the CA's finding that the deposits were not valid, and not covered by PDIC insurance due to the facts that the funds were credited to the bank president's personal account, not recorded as liabilities of the bank, and CTDs were not validly issued.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Determination of "Usual Course of Business":** SC found the inter-branch deposit method used by petitioners as "hardly considered as in the ordinary course of business." This determination hinges on facts and circumstances and may be a point of contention in similar cases.
*   **Reliance on Bank Records:** PDIC's reliance on the failed bank's records raises concerns about the accuracy/completeness of those records, potentially unfairly prejudicing depositors if records are incomplete or manipulated.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Monetary Board v. Philippine Veterans Bank, 751 Phil. 176 (2015):*** Defines a quasi-judicial agency and function.
*   ***Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. v. CA, 347 Phil. 741 (1997):*** States that the corresponding deposit must be placed in the insured bank for a claim to prosper.
*   ***Pascual v. Burgos, et al., 776 Phil. 167 (2016):*** Defines grave abuse of discretion.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "usual course of business" is somewhat ambiguous and open to interpretation, potentially creating uncertainty for depositors making unconventional (but legitimate) deposit transactions.
*   The heavy reliance on bank records might prejudice legitimate depositors, particularly in cases of fraud or mismanagement within the bank, where accurate records might be unavailable.

**Conclusion:**

This case reinforces the PDIC's authority in determining deposit insurance eligibility and clarifies that appeals of PDIC decisions are under the jurisdiction of the CA. The case also highlights the importance of adhering to standard banking practices and ensuring deposits are properly recorded to avoid denial of insurance claims. The vagueness surrounding "usual course of business" and reliance on bank records create potential areas of legal dispute in future cases.
