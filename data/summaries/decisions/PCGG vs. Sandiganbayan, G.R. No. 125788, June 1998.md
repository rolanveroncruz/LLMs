## Legal Document Summary: PCGG vs. Sandiganbayan and Aerocom Investors & Managers, Inc. (G.R. No. 125788, June 5, 1998)

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Certiorari filed by the PCGG challenging a Sandiganbayan Resolution ordering the release of dividends to Aerocom, arguing the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion. The Sandiganbayan had ruled that Aerocom itself was not validly sequestered, only the shares of Nieto and Africa.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sec. 26, Article XVIII of the 1987 Constitution:** This is the central provision in dispute. It dictates the timeframe for issuing sequestration orders and commencing judicial actions. The Court interprets this section to require both the issuance *and service* of a writ of sequestration within 18 months of ratification. It also requires that a corresponding judicial action be commenced within six months from the issuance of the sequestration order.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Timeliness of Sequestration:** Was the sequestration of Aerocom timely under Sec. 26, Art. XVIII of the Constitution? The PCGG issued the sequestration order within the 18-month period, but service occurred *after* the deadline.
2.  **Requirement of "Judicial Action":** Does the inclusion of Aerocom in Annex "A" of the complaint in Civil Case No. 0009 (Nieto, Africa, et al. case) satisfy the constitutional requirement of a "corresponding judicial action" against Aerocom within the prescribed 6-month period, despite Aerocom not being impleaded as a defendant?
3.  **Estoppel:** Is the PCGG estopped from denying the non-sequestered status of Aerocom, given prior PCGG resolutions authorizing the release of dividends to Aerocom?

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **PCGG:** Risk of having its sequestration order declared invalid. Potential liability for failing to comply with constitutional deadlines and procedural requirements.
*   **Aerocom:** Risk of continued sequestration and loss of dividends if the PCGG's arguments were to prevail.
*   **Risk of Abuse:** The Court highlights the risk of abuse inherent in sequestration powers, emphasizing the need for strict adherence to constitutional safeguards.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Sec. 26, Article XVIII, 1987 Constitution:** Crucial constitutional provision.
*   **Republic v. Sandiganbayan (240 SCRA 376):** PCGG argued this case supports their position that listing a corporation as a "dummy" is sufficient "judicial action." The Court distinguished this case, noting that the *Republic v. Sandiganbayan* case presupposes a valid and existing sequestration.
*   **PCGG v. Interco:** Reaffirms the principle that a corporation has a distinct legal personality separate from its stockholders.
*   **Republic v. Sandiganbayan, Sipalay Trading Corp. and Allied Banking Corp. (255 SCRA 438):**  The Court aligns with the dissenting opinion in the *Republic v. Sandiganbayan (240 SCRA 376)* case, emphasizing the due process rights of corporations and the need to implead them as defendants.
*   **BASECO v. PCGG (150 SCRA 181):** Cited for the proposition that sequestration is an "extra-ordinary, harsh and severe remedy" that should be strictly construed and applied.
*   **Article 13 of the Civil Code:** Regarding computation of time.
*   **National Marketing Corp. v. Tecson (29 SCRA 70):** Regarding computation of time.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Judicial Action or Proceeding" in Sec. 26, Art. XVIII:** The meaning of this phrase is central to the dispute. The PCGG argues that naming a corporation in an annex to a complaint suffices, while the Court disagrees.
*   **The PCGG's ability to reverse its prior decisions on releasing the dividends:** The Court finds the PCGG estopped based on their previous resolutions and the advice of their former legal counsel.

**Conclusion:**

The Court sided with Aerocom, dismissing the PCGG's petition.  The Sandiganbayan's Resolutions were affirmed. The Court held that (1) a writ of sequestration must be both issued *and served* within the 18-month deadline set by the Constitution; (2) merely mentioning a corporation in an annex to a complaint against its shareholders does *not* constitute a "judicial action" against the corporation itself; and (3) the PCGG was estopped from denying Aerocom's non-sequestered status due to prior resolutions authorizing the release of dividends. The decision emphasizes the importance of due process and strict adherence to constitutional limitations on the power of sequestration. The PCGG should have availed of the remedy of appeal instead of a petition for certiorari, as the arguments the PCGG propounds in support of its challenge on the Sandiganbayan Resolutions would amount to a digging into the merits and unearthing errors of judgment
