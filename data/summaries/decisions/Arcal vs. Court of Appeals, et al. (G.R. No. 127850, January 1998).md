## Legal Document Summary: *Arcal v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 127850

**Nature:** Petition for review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) affirmation of the Municipal Trial Court's (MTC) decision in an unlawful detainer case.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioners (Arcals) filed an unlawful detainer complaint in MTC against Respondents, alleging tolerance of occupancy without contract or rent.
*   Respondents previously filed suits questioning Petitioners' ownership (Civil Cases TM-59 and TM-146, for annulment of title/reconveyance and registration of claim, respectively), both ultimately dismissed against them.
*   Petitioners previously filed an ejectment suit (Civil Case 285) which was dismissed without prejudice to the filing of the proper action after the prejudicial question in Civil Case No. TM-146 is resolved in a fair and adversary proceeding.
*   Written demands to vacate were made on Respondents, the last being on July 23, 1995, but they refused.

**MTC Ruling:** Ruled in favor of Petitioners (Arcals), ordering Respondents to vacate, remove improvements, pay rent, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.

**RTC Ruling:** Affirmed MTC in toto.

**CA Ruling:** Reversed RTC and dismissed the unlawful detainer complaint, holding that Petitioners' allegations and admissions show the case is not one of unlawful detainer as Respondents did not actually occupy the subject property upon the tolerance of Petitioners as this tolerance was withdrawn in 1984.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** Granted the Petition, reinstated the MTC and RTC judgments.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Tolerance of Occupancy:** The core issue revolves around whether Respondents' possession was initially based on the Petitioners' tolerance, thus making them susceptible to an unlawful detainer suit upon demand to vacate.
*   **Demand Requirement:** The action was filed within one year of the last demand to vacate (July 23, 1995), fulfilling a jurisdictional requirement for unlawful detainer as per Rule 70, Sections 1 and 2, Revised Rules of Court.
*   **Physical or Material Possession (Possession de Facto):** Unlawful detainer involves only the issue of physical or material possession over the property or possession de facto, that is who between the plaintiff and the defendant has a better right to possess the property in question. The Court reiterated that the suit is confined to the recovery of de facto or physical possession of the property.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondents are liable to vacate the property and remove improvements.
*   Respondents are liable for rent from the date of the demand letter, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses as ordered by the MTC.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Tolerance Issue:** The CA questioned whether tolerance was withdrawn in 1984 when an earlier ejectment case was filed (Civil Case 285). The Supreme Court effectively dismissed this concern due to the subsequent dismissal of the annulment/reconveyance cases, thereby effectively reviving any prior tolerance.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70, Sections 1 and 2, Revised Rules of Court:** Governs unlawful detainer actions, including the one-year prescriptive period from demand.
*   **B.P. Blg. 129, Section 33(2):** Grants Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Court exclusive original jurisdiction over cases of forcible entry and unlawful detainer, even when ownership is raised in the pleadings.
*   **Res Judicata:** While the previous annulment/reconveyance cases (TM-59 and TM-146) were cited, the relevant res judicata application pertains only to the dismissal of those cases, precluding re-litigation of the ownership issue.
*   **Numerous cases cited by SC:** *Sumulong v. Court of Appeals*, *Sarmiento v. Court of Appeals*, *Hilario v. Court of Appeals*, *Odsigue v. Court of Appeals*, *Calubayan v. Pascual*, *Dizon v. Concina* and *Wilmon Auto Supply v. Court of Appeals*, *William Auto supply Corporation, et al., vs. Court of Appeals, et al.* among others.

**Summary Analysis & Legal Precision:**

The Supreme Court's decision hinged on the fact that the MTC complaint sufficiently alleged tolerance, demand, and subsequent refusal to vacate, which, when proven, are the elements of unlawful detainer. The Court distinguished the present case as involving only *possession de facto* and emphasized the MTC's jurisdiction even when ownership is raised. The CA erred in focusing on the potentially withdrawn tolerance as, after the termination of TM-59 and TM-146 in the Petitioners' favor, the original tolerance was effectively re-established. The Court reinforced established jurisprudence regarding summary actions for ejectment and the limited scope of issues in such proceedings.
