**Case:** *Lolita Y. Eugenio v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 168163, March 26, 2008 (573 Phil. 22)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and acquitted Lolita Y. Eugenio of Estafa thru Falsification of Public Documents based on reasonable doubt. The case stemmed from loan transactions facilitated by Eugenio between Alfredo Mangali and two individuals (Saquitan and Ty), where allegedly falsified land titles (TCT No. 171602 and TCT No. 92585) were used as security.

**Key Provisions/Allegations:**

*   **Charges:** Estafa thru Falsification of Public Documents (Art. 315 par. 2(a) in relation to Art. 172, in further relation to Art. 48, Revised Penal Code).
*   **Modus Operandi Alleged:** Eugenio introduced individuals with falsified land titles to Mangali, inducing him to extend loans against those titles.
*   **Prosecution's Argument:** Eugenio misrepresented the validity of the titles, conspired with others to defraud Mangali, and actively participated in the loan negotiations. Reliance was placed on the presumption that possession of a falsified document implies authorship of the falsification.
*   **Defense Argument:** Eugenio acted as a commissioned agent for Mangali's lending business, had no knowledge of the titles' falsification and was performing her job which was to find prospective borrowers; she acted in good faith based on the information she got from the Register of Deeds of Manila.
*   **Entrapment:** An entrapment operation led to Eugenio's arrest while allegedly demanding an additional loan.
*   **Duplicitous Information:**  The Information charged petitioner with two counts of Estafa thru Falsification of Public Documents by falsifying TCT No. 171602 and TCT No. 92585, and using them, in separate transactions, as security to induce Mangali to extend loans to Saquitan and Ty, however, for petitioner's failure to move for the quashal of the Information on this ground, petitioner is deemed to have waived the objection

**Key Obligations/Liabilities (at Trial):**

*   The trial court found Eugenio guilty and ordered her to pay P175,005 as actual damages.

**Potential Risks (at Trial/Appeals):**

*   **Conspiracy:** Potential liability as a principal based on implied conspiracy.
*   **Presumption of Falsification:** Risk of conviction based on the presumption that possessors who benefit from falsified documents are the authors.

**Court's Holding & Rationale:**

*   The Supreme Court acquitted Eugenio, finding that the prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Lack of Proof of Conspiracy:** The Court found that Eugenio's actions were consistent with her role as Mangali's agent (commission-based), not necessarily indicative of a conspiracy. There was no concrete evidence that she benefitted from the use of the falsified titles.
*   **Rebutted Presumption:** Eugenio's unrebutted testimony indicated that the titles were presented by the borrowers (Saquitan and Ty), not necessarily by her. The Civil Register of Manila certified as true copy the photocopy of TCT No. 171602 that Saquitan gave petitioner
* Constitutional Right: The prosecution failed to rebut petitioner's testimony that she was only acquainted with Ablaza who introduced Saquitan and Ty to her.
*   **Inadmissible Evidence:** The real "Epifania Saquitan" was never presented during trial, rendering her affidavit inadmissible

**Statutory References:**

*   Art. 315 par. 2(a) and Art. 172, in further relation to Art. 48, Revised Penal Code (Estafa thru Falsification).
*   Art. 171, Revised Penal Code (Modes of Falsification).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The existence and scope of the alleged conspiracy. The lower courts' reliance on circumstantial evidence.
*   Application of the presumption regarding authorship of falsification.

**Potential Issues on Appeal (if applicable):**

* Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) erred in affirming the trial court's finding that the petitioner employed deceit in leading the private complainant to believe that the titles possessed by the accused were genuine.
* Whether the CA erred in finding that the petitioner made representations in behalf of her co-accused, which were constitutive of conspiracy.
* Whether the courts a quo erred in holding that the prosecution proved the guilt of the petitioner beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa thru Falsification of Public Documents.
* Whether the courts a quo erred in disregarding the alleged violations of the constitutional rights of the petitioner.
