**Case Summary: Premiere Development Bank v. NLRC and Labanda, G.R. No. 114695, July 23, 1998**

**Key Issue:** Did the employee (Labanda) abandon her employment by filing a civil action for damages against the employer (Premiere Development Bank)? Was the preventive suspension lawful?

**Facts:** Labanda, a bank teller, allegedly misposted a check deposit, leading to an overstatement of a depositor's balance. The bank investigated, finding Labanda primarily liable. She was placed on preventive suspension and asked to shoulder a portion of the loss. Labanda objected, requested a copy of the audit report, and demanded payment for alleged arbitrary and illegal acts, eventually filing a civil action for damages.  She later filed for illegal dismissal.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court upheld the NLRC's decision that Labanda was illegally dismissed and did not abandon her job.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Preventive Suspension:** The Court found the indefinite preventive suspension of Labanda (exceeding the 30-day period outlined in *Implementing Rules, Section 4, Rule XIV, Book V of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code*) to be constructive dismissal.
*   **Due Process in Dismissal:** The Court emphasized that the employer must comply with the notice and hearing requirements before dismissing an employee (*Implementing Rules, Sec. 2, 5, 6, and 7, Rule XIV, Book V*). Even in cases of abandonment, notice must be served at the employee's last known address.
*   **Abandonment of Work:** The Court stated that to constitute abandonment, there must be (1) failure to report for work without valid reason, and (2) a clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship (*Artemio Labor, et al vs. NLRC et. al, G.R. No. 110388, September 14, 1995, 248 SCRA 183*). Filing a complaint for illegal dismissal contradicts the idea of abandoning the job (*Santos & Judric Canning Corporation v. Inciong, G.R. No. 51494, August 19, 1982, 115 SCRA 887*).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Premiere Development Bank:** Liable for illegal dismissal. Ordered to reinstate Labanda with backwages and benefits for three years.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Negligence:** The court sidestepped the issue of whether or not Labanda was negligent.
*   **Evidence of Intention:** The law doesn't specifically outline the definition of overt acts to be considered as strong evidence of severance of the employment relationship.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code (as implemented by the Omnibus Rules):**  Governs the procedural due process requirements for dismissal.
*   **Civil Code Article 1146:** Regarding the 4-year prescriptive period for actions based on injury to employee rights.
*   *General Textiles, Inc. vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 102969, April 4, 1995, 243 SCRA 232*
*   *PAL Employees Savings and Loan Association, Inc. vs. NLRC, 260 SCRA 758, August 22, 1996*
*   *De Ysasi III vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 104599, 231 SCRA 173, March 11, 1994*
*   *Sampang v. Inciong, G.R. No. L-50992, June 19, 1985, 137 SCRA 561*

**Conclusion:**

The bank failed to prove abandonment and violated Labanda's right to due process. The filing of the civil case for damages was deemed an act of protest against the suspension and not an indication of intent to abandon employment. The decision affirms the employee's right to security of tenure and highlights the importance of adhering to due process requirements in termination proceedings.
