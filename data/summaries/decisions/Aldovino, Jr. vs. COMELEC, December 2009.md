## Legal Document Summary: *Aldovino, Jr. v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 184836

**Overview:** This case concerns the application of the three-term limit rule for elective local officials under Section 8, Article X of the Constitution and Section 43(b) of RA 7160 (Local Government Code) in relation to preventive suspension. The core issue is whether a Sandiganbayan-imposed preventive suspension on a city councilor interrupts his term for the purpose of the three-term limit, allowing him to run for a fourth consecutive term. The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the COMELEC's ruling that the suspension was an interruption, thus disqualifying the councilor from running for a fourth term.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Three-Term Limit Rule:** The Constitution limits elective local officials to three consecutive terms. Voluntary renunciation does not interrupt the continuity of service.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** The Petitioners argued that the councilor had already served three consecutive terms and should not be allowed to run for a fourth term, as preventive suspension does not interrupt the continuity of service.
*   **COMELEC's Argument:** The COMELEC initially ruled that the preventive suspension constituted an interruption because the councilor was unable to provide complete service for the full term.
*   **Court's Reasoning:** The SC ruled that the "interruption" must involve involuntary *loss of title* to the office. Temporary inability to exercise functions, even involuntarily, does not count as an interruption. Preventive suspension does not cause loss of title, merely a temporary bar from exercising functions.
*   The SC distinguishes between *interruption of term* vs *interruption of service* and the intent of the three-term rule.
*   The court emphasizes the need for a 'break' or 'rest period' where an elected official vacates their position.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 8, Article X of the Constitution:** The foundation for the three-term limit.
*   **Section 43(b) of RA 7160 (Local Government Code):** Repeats the constitutional provision.
*   **RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), RA 6770 (Ombudsman Act):** These acts provide for preventive suspension, but are distinct from term limitation concerns.
*   **Borja v. COMELEC:** Discusses three-term limit in the context of succession, but not preventive suspension directly.
*   **Lonzanida v. COMELEC:** Severance from office due to a court order (writ of execution) *is* an interruption.
*   **Ong v. Alegre & Rivera v. COMELEC:** Stressed that even with challenges to the term, the three-term limitation applies.
*   **Adormeo v. COMELEC & Socrates v. COMELEC:** established that the law contemplates a complete break from office during which the local elective official steps down.
*   **Latasa v. COMELEC:** Conversion of municipality to a city did not reset the term clock. Highlights intent to prevent prolonged stay in power.
*   **Montebon v. COMELEC:** Highest ranking official succeeding as vice mayor was considered an interruption.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Disqualified Candidate:** The councilor is disqualified from running for and serving a fourth term.
*   **COMELEC's Duty:** COMELEC has a duty to enforce Section 8, Article X, and their failure to do so constitutes grave abuse of discretion.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Potential for Abuse:** The dissent argues the ruling opens the door to political manipulation through administrative charges leading to preventive suspensions.
*   **Definition of "Interruption":** The dissent argues that the definition of interruption should not necessitate loss of title to office.
*   **Voluntary vs. Involuntary Renunciation:** The dissenting opinion argues that the concept of ‘involuntary renunciation’ should be considered and the strict interpretation of a ‘loss of title’ creates opportunities for abuse.

**Dissenting Arguments:**

*   Justice Carpio argued that the preventive suspension, being involuntary, interrupted the councilor's term. *Any* involuntary severance from office should be considered an interruption. The Dissenting Opinion argued that the preventive suspension should be considered, for purposes of the application of the three-term limit rule, a voluntary renunciation of office only upon conviction by final judgement of the official for the offense for which he was preventively suspended.
*   The dissent emphasized that it is *service* to the electorate that matters, not merely holding the *title* to the office. Preventive suspension deprives the electorate of their chosen representative.
*   The dissent highlighted potential for abuse via successive preventive suspensions.

**Legal Precision & Ambiguities:**

*   The ruling hinges on a narrow interpretation of "interruption" as requiring loss of title. This creates a bright-line rule but potentially opens avenues for circumvention via successive administrative charges.
*   The SC's use of "voluntary renunciation" as the standard for what does *not* constitute an interruption leaves room for arguments about other involuntary circumstances that might *effectively* disrupt service even if the officeholder retains title.
*   The discussion of "force majeure" and extended illness is illustrative but not definitive, potentially leading to future litigation about the scope of permissible interruptions.

**Overall Assessment:**

This case provides a strict interpretation of the three-term limit rule, emphasizing loss of title as the crucial factor for "interruption." However, the dissent raises valid concerns about potential abuse and a more functional approach that considers the actual service rendered to the electorate. This decision could be vulnerable to challenge in future cases with slightly different factual scenarios involving administrative suspensions or other disruptions of service.
