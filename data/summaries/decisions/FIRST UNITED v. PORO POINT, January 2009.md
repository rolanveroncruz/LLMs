**Legal Document Summary: *First United Constructors Corporation v. Poro Point Management Corporation (PPMC)***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 178799, January 19, 2009, 596 Phil. 334

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision dismissing a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** First United Constructors Corporation (FUCC)
*   **Respondents:** Poro Point Management Corporation (PPMC), The Special Bids & Awards Committee (SBAC) of PPMC, Atty. Felix S. Racadio, and Satrap Construction Company, Inc. (SCCI)

**Subject Matter:**  Dispute over the bidding and award of the contract for the Upgrading of the San Fernando Airport Project, Phase I. FUCC challenges the re-bidding process, the award to SCCI, and seeks to be declared the winning bidder.

**Key Provisions & Events:**

1.  **Original Bidding & Disqualification:** FUCC initially pre-qualified but was disqualified due to a failing technical proposal (failure to submit AWOS, unsigned pages, and tax returns).
2.  **Protest & Denial:** FUCC protested the disqualification; PPMC Head Atty. Racadio denied the protest, citing presumption of regularity. Filing fee was forfeited per IRR-A, RA 1984, Sec. 55.1.
3.  **Re-bidding:** PPMC re-bid the project. FUCC sought injunction from RTC (Civil Case No. 7274) to stop re-bidding.
4.  **TRO & RA 8975:** RTC issued TRO, but lifted it citing Section 3 of RA 8975 (prohibiting lower courts from issuing TROs against government infrastructure projects).
5.  **Award to SCCI:** SCCI was awarded the contract as the lowest qualified bidder.
6.  **Petition for Injunction Dismissal:** FUCC initially filed a petition for injunction with the RTC, then requested and obtained its dismissal after the OGCC argued lack of jurisdiction.
7.  **Petition for Certiorari to SC:** FUCC filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition directly to the Supreme Court, seeking annulment of the re-bidding and award, claiming grave abuse of discretion.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **PPMC/SBAC:** Obligation to conduct fair and transparent bidding process; discretion to accept or reject bids is subject to scrutiny for fraud, injustice, or grave abuse of discretion.
*   **FUCC:** Obligation to comply with bidding requirements and follow proper legal procedure for challenging SBAC decisions. Obligation to file appropriate legal actions within prescriptive periods.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Did SBAC/PPMC commit grave abuse of discretion in disqualifying FUCC's bid and awarding the contract to SCCI?
2.  **Procedural Issues:** Was the Petition for Certiorari filed within the prescribed 60-day period under Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure? Did FUCC violate the doctrine of judicial hierarchy by filing directly with the Supreme Court?
3.  **Application of RA 8975:** Does RA 8975 prohibit the issuance of a permanent injunction by the RTC after a full adjudication on the merits?

**Court's Ruling:**

The Supreme Court dismissed the petition.

*   **Procedural Lapses:** FUCC failed to file the Petition for Certiorari within the 60-day period.  FUCC violated the doctrine of judicial hierarchy by directly filing with the SC without demonstrating special and important reasons.
*   **No Grave Abuse of Discretion:** FUCC failed to present evidence of fraud, unfairness, injustice, or grave abuse of discretion in the bidding process.
*   **PPMC's Right to Reject Bids:** PPMC had the right to reject any bid based on the reserved right in the invitation to bid.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 9184** (Government Procurement Reform Act): Section 55-58 outlines the procedure to challenge decisions of the SBAC.
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 8975:**  Prohibits lower courts from issuing TROs or preliminary injunctions against government infrastructure projects, except in cases of extreme urgency involving constitutional issues.
*   **Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Governs special civil actions for certiorari; Section 4 sets the 60-day filing deadline.
*   *JG Summit Holdings, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 450 SCRA 169 (2005):  Discusses the wide latitude of discretion vested in government agencies regarding bid acceptance/rejection and the standard for grave abuse of discretion.
*   *Bases Conversion and Development Authority v. Uy*, 506 SCRA 524 (2006): Clarifies RA 8975 does not prohibit permanent injunctions issued after a full adjudication on the merits.
*   *Alvarez v. PICOP Resources, Inc.*, 508 SCRA 498 (2006): Affirms courts' authority to hear principal actions and grant relief (except TROs/preliminary injunctions) in cases involving government infrastructure projects.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to Comply with Procurement Laws:** Risks associated with non-compliance by PPMC with RA 9184's requirements for fair and transparent bidding, though no violation was proven in this case.
*   **Project Delay:** Challenges to government infrastructure projects can lead to delays, potentially increasing costs and affecting public welfare. This is the reason for RA 8975.
*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** Counsel should be wary of failing to abide by established court hierarchies, which can lead to immediate dismissal of case.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Grave Abuse of Discretion":**  The standard for proving grave abuse of discretion remains somewhat subjective and requires a strong showing of capriciousness, arbitrariness, or patent disregard of legal duties.
* **Sec. 55.1, IRR-A, RA 1984** Non-refundable fee that is forfeited in favor of PPMC
