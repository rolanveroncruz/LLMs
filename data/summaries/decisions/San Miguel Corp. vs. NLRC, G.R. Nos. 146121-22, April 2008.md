## Legal Document Summary: SMC vs. NLRC & Ibias (G.R. Nos. 146121-22)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** San Miguel Corporation (SMC) and Geribern Abella (Plant Manager)
*   **Respondents:** National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), Labor Arbiter Pedro Ramos, and Ernesto Ibias (Employee)

**Key Issue:** Legality of Ernesto Ibias' dismissal from SMC. The main contentions revolve around unauthorized absences (AWOPs) and alleged falsification of company records (medical consultation card).

**Facts:**

*   Ibias was employed by SMC from 1978 until his dismissal.
*   SMC's Policy on Employee Conduct outlines disciplinary actions for AWOPs, with discharge as the penalty for the 9th AWOP or 6+ consecutive days. Falsification is also grounds for discharge on the first offense.
*   SMC alleges Ibias incurred numerous AWOPs in 1997 and falsified his medical consultation card to cover absences.
*   Ibias was issued Notices to Explain but SMC deemed his explanations unsatisfactory and terminated his employment.
*   The Labor Arbiter initially ruled the dismissal illegal, ordering reinstatement and backwages. The NLRC affirmed but modified to separation pay due to strained relations and removed attorney's fees.
*   The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the illegality of dismissal, reinstated the Labor Arbiter's decision (with modified backwages), and rejected strained relations as grounds for denying reinstatement.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **SMC's Employee Conduct Policy:** This is the central contractual agreement governing employee behavior and discipline. Specific violations, including AWOPs and falsification, are defined along with corresponding penalties. This policy serves as the legal basis for the disciplinary action.
*   **AWOPs:** SMC argues Ibias accumulated numerous AWOPs, exceeding the threshold for dismissal under the company policy.
*   **Falsification:** SMC alleges Ibias falsified his medical consultation card, a dischargeable offense. They present testimonies from Siwa and Marable regarding Ibias's supposed admission.
*   **Ibias's Defense:** Ibias denies falsification and claims he had supporting papers for his absences. He also argues SMC's policy was not strictly enforced.
*   **Due Process:** SMC maintains it provided Ibias with due process through Notices to Explain and an administrative investigation.
*   **Management Prerogative:** SMC asserts its right to manage its workforce and enforce its policies, including the right to impose disciplinary measures.

**Court's Ruling:**

The Supreme Court **reversed** the CA decision, siding with SMC regarding the unauthorized absences.

*   **Falsification:** The Court agreed with the lower tribunals that SMC failed to prove the falsification charge with substantial evidence. Mere possession of a falsified document, without proof of the employee's involvement in the falsification, is insufficient.
*   **AWOPs:** The Court disagreed with the lower courts' finding that SMC's inconsistent enforcement of its policy made the dismissal disproportionate. It considered SMC's actions leniency, not laxity. The Court stated that the employee had accumulated enough absences to justify termination of employment.
*   **Management Prerogative:** The Court upheld SMC's management prerogative to prescribe and enforce reasonable rules and regulations. The dismissal was deemed a valid exercise of this prerogative.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Substantial Evidence Standard:**  The ruling hinges on the application of the "substantial evidence" standard in labor cases. While lower than preponderance of evidence, the line between sufficient and insufficient substantial evidence can be subjective and a point of contention in similar cases.
*   **Enforcement of Company Policy:** The Supreme Court considered the employer's actions as leniency and a valid exercise of managerial rights. Lax enforcement of company policy can be interpreted very differently by the courts on a case-by-case basis.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   Labor Code (implied throughout regarding illegal dismissal)
*   *Cando v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 91344) cited regarding the burden of proof for condonation or laxity in enforcing company rules.
*   *Quijano v. Mercury Drug Corporation* (354 Phil. 112) cited and distinguished regarding strained relations.
*   *Hantex Trading Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (438 Phil. 737) on the finality of factual findings by the Court of Appeals, NLRC and the Labor Arbiter.
*   *Salvador v. Philippine Mining Service Corporation* (443 Phil. 878) on the meaning of substantial evidence.
*   *Gustilo v. Wyeth Philippines, Inc.* (G.R. No. 149629) on management prerogatives.
*   *Coca Cola Bottlers, Phils., Inc. v. Kapisanan ng Malayang Manggagawa sa Coca Cola-FFW* (G.R. No. 148205) on the employer's discretion in promulgating policies.
*   *Lopez v. National Labor Relations Commission* (G.R. No. 167385) on the employer's right to impose disciplinary sanctions.
*   *Samar II Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. NLRC* (337 Phil. 24) on the principle of fair play.

**Implications:** This decision reinforces the importance of clearly defined and consistently (though not necessarily strictly) enforced company policies regarding employee conduct and attendance. It also emphasizes the employer's right to manage its workforce and impose disciplinary measures, provided due process is observed. It signals that labor tribunals are permitted to consider leniency toward errant workers as an action that is within managerial rights.
