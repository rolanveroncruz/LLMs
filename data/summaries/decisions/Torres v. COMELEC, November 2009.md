**Legal Document Summary: *Torres v. COMELEC & Gaviola*, G.R. No. 187956 (2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing a COMELEC En Banc Resolution reversing a lower court decision and proclaiming the protestant, Gaviola, as the duly elected Punong Barangay.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **COMELEC's Power of Review:** Affirms COMELEC's authority to review and revise election results, including re-examining ballots. (Art. IX-C, Sec. 2(2), Constitution; Omnibus Election Code)
*   **Ballot Appreciation:** Deals with the rules on appreciation of ballots, particularly regarding handwriting analysis and the invalidation of ballots allegedly filled out by a single person. Focuses on the principle that handwriting identification must consider consistent dissimilarities in fundamental characteristics. *Silverio v. Clamor*, 125 Phil. 917, 927 (1967)

**Obligations:**

*   **COMELEC:** To fairly and accurately appreciate contested ballots based on established legal principles.
*   **Parties:** To present evidence and arguments supporting their claims regarding ballot validity.

**Liabilities:**

*   No explicit liability clauses. However, misapplication of ballot appreciation rules could lead to reversal of COMELEC decisions.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The central issue is whether the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in invalidating ballots for Torres. The Court ultimately found grave abuse due to erroneous handwriting analysis. *De Guzman v. Commission on Elections*, G.R. No. 159713 (2004)
*   **Subjectivity in Handwriting Analysis:** The document highlights the inherent subjectivity in handwriting analysis. The COMELEC's reliance on general outlook similarity without considering individual characteristics proved to be a weakness.
*   **Marked Ballots:** The ruling regarding Exhibits GAV-3 and GAV-4 from Precinct No. 549B/D (marked ballots) could raise concerns about voter anonymity and secrecy of the ballot.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Art. IX-C, Sec. 2(2):** COMELEC's power to decide election contests.
*   **Omnibus Election Code:** General provisions regarding election procedures and ballot counting.
*   ***Silverio v. Clamor*, 125 Phil. 917, 927 (1967):** Establishes the principle of handwriting identification requiring consistent dissimilarities.
*   ***De Guzman v. Commission on Elections*, G.R. No. 159713 (2004):** Highlights the court's power to reverse the COMELEC if its appreciation of ballots is grossly mistaken.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"One Person Filling Up Two Ballots":** The application of this rule seems overly broad. The Court found that many ballots invalidated for this reason were actually filled out by different people.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court reversed the COMELEC, reinstated the proclamation of Torres as the elected Punong Barangay, and affirmed the lower court's initial decision, based on a corrected vote count due to the erroneous invalidation of ballots. The final tally showed Torres winning by 58 votes.
