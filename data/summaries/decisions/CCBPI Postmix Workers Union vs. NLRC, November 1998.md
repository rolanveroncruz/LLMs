Here's a legal summary of the document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *CCBPI Postmix Workers Union vs. National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) and Coca-Cola Bottlers, Phil., Inc.* G.R. No. 114521 & G.R. No. 123491, November 27, 1998.

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for certiorari under Rule 65 challenging NLRC resolutions regarding the legality of a strike and the subsequent termination of union employees.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Legality of the Strike:**  Was the April 20, 1987 strike illegal due to non-compliance with the mandatory seven-day strike ban under Article 264(f) of the Labor Code?
2.  **Employee Status:** Were the terminated employees union officers or mere members at the time of the strike?
3.  **Legality of Dismissal:** Was the termination of the employees legal considering the (il)legality of the strike and their status as union members/officers?

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court AFFIRMED the NLRC's resolution declaring the strike illegal due to the union's failure to observe the seven-day strike ban. Citing *National Federation of Sugar Workers vs. Ovejera* (114 SCRA 354, 365), the court emphasized the mandatory nature of this period.  Article 13 of the Civil Code was cited to justify how the day should be counted
*   The Court AFFIRMED the NLRC's decision ordering the reinstatement of certain terminated employees, finding them to be mere union members, not officers, at the time of the illegal strike. They relied on Certification from the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR) and the omission of the employees' names in the company's initial petition to declare the strike illegal as evidence of their status.
*   The court emphasized that mere participation in an illegal strike is not sufficient grounds for the termination of rank-and-file union members citing *Allied Banking Corporation vs. NLRC, 258 SCRA 724, 744.*. *Bacus vs. Ople (132 SCRA 690, 703)* was cited stating that a strike illegality finding doesn't justify wholesale dismissal of strikers.

**Key Provisions, Obligations, and Liabilities:**

*   **Article 264 of the Labor Code:** Governs strikes, picketing, and lockouts, specifically outlining requirements for legal strikes and consequences of illegal ones. *Gold City Integrated Port Service, Inc. vs. NLRC, 245 SCRA 627, 637-638*
*   **Article 265 of the Labor Code:** Prohibits strikes or lockouts without collective bargaining, required notices, or necessary strike/lockout votes.
*   **Obligation to Observe Strike Requirements:** Unions must comply with the 30/15-day notice rule, obtain a 2/3 strike vote, and submit the strike vote report to DOLE at least 7 days before the strike.
*   **Liability of Union Officers:** Union officers who knowingly participate in an illegal strike may lose their employment status.
*   **Liability of Union Members:** Union members cannot be terminated solely for participating in an illegal strike unless they committed illegal acts. *Philippine Airlines, Inc. vs. Secretary of Labor and Employment, 193 SCRA 223*
*   The Court ordered Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc. to reinstate Edmar L. Basco to his former position, without loss of seniority rights and other privileges appurtenant thereto, with full back wages from the time of his dismissal until he is actually reinstated, or to pay him separation pay, if reinstatement is no longer feasible.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Illegal Acts:** Determining what constitutes "illegal acts" during a strike can be contentious.  The burden of proof lies on the employer to demonstrate the specific acts committed by individual employees.
*   **Determining Union Officer Status:** The definition of "union officer" can be ambiguous.  Signatories on CBA or participation in negotiations do not automatically equate to "officer" status. The court gives weight to official BLR certifications.
*   **Quitclaims:** Four of the terminated employees already signed a Deed of Receipt, Release and Quitclaim to fully settle any and all claims against the company.
