## Legal Document Summary: *Urbano v. People*, G.R. No. 182750 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a CA decision affirming conviction for Homicide under Art. 249 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Facts:** Petitioner Urbano and the victim Tomelden were involved in a fistfight after a picnic. Tomelden hurled insults at Urbano, leading to an exchange of blows.  Urbano delivered a "lucky punch" causing Tomelden to fall unconscious.  Tomelden died 12 days later due to "cardio-respiratory arrest secondary to cerebral concussion with resultant cerebral hemorrhage due to mauling incident."

**Holding:**  RTC and CA found Urbano guilty of Homicide.  Supreme Court AFFIRMED conviction but MODIFIED the sentence to account for mitigating circumstances.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Art. 249, RPC (Homicide):** Defines and penalizes the unlawful killing of another without qualifying circumstances.
*   **Art. 13(3) & (4), RPC (Mitigating Circumstances):** Applies mitigating circumstances of lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong and sufficient provocation.
*   **Art. 64(5), RPC (Rules for Application of Penalties):** Dictates that when multiple mitigating circumstances exist and no aggravating circumstances are present, the penalty should be lowered by one degree.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Requires imposition of an indeterminate sentence, with minimum and maximum terms within the prescribed range.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:**  Guilty of Homicide, but sentence reduced due to mitigating circumstances.
*   **Civil Liability:** Liable for civil indemnity and moral damages to the heirs of the victim.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Causation Dispute:** The defense argued that Tomelden's death was due to pre-existing hypertension, not the fistfight.  The Court rejected this argument, relying on the autopsy and medical testimony connecting the punch to the cerebral hemorrhage.
*   **Lack of Intent:**  The defense argued lack of intent to kill. Initially unsuccessful, the Supreme Court overturned and agreed.
*   **Absence of Provocation:** The prosecution could argue that Tomelden's initial provocation wasn't significant enough.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 249, RPC:**  Defines Homicide and its corresponding penalty.
*   **Art. 13, RPC:**  Lists mitigating circumstances relevant to the case, specifically paragraphs 3 and 4.
*   **Art. 64, RPC:** Governs the application of penalties, focusing on the presence of mitigating/aggravating circumstances.
*   **Navarro v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 121087 (1999):** Cited for application of mitigating circumstances of sufficient provocation.
*   **People v. Macaso, No. L-30489 (1975):** Another cited for application of mitigating circumstances of sufficient provocation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The issue of proximate cause was highly contentious, with the defense attempting to sever the connection between the punch and the death.
*   The issue of intent was heavily debated, with the court ultimately finding Urbano's actions not indicative of an intent to kill.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for Homicide but modified the sentence, appreciating the mitigating circumstances of sufficient provocation and lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong. Sentence reduced to indeterminate prison term of 2 years and 4 months of *prision correccional*, as minimum, to 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor*, as maximum. The court also maintained the civil indemnity and moral damages.
