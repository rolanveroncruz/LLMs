**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Interpretation of DBM BC No. 2006-1 regarding timing of CNA Incentive payments (mid-year vs. end-of-year) and documentation of savings.

**Holding:**

*   **Petition Dismissed.** COA's disallowance affirmed.
*   **Absolved from Refund.** Petitioner, concerned officials, and DOST employees absolved from refund due to good faith.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   Initially, Solidary Liability was imposed on officers who approved the grant of CNA Incentives and payees were held liable based on *solutio indebiti.* However, the Supreme Court reversed this aspect.
*   **Risk:** While the individuals are absolved from refund in this specific case, the DOST is at risk of future disallowances if it continues to grant CNA Incentives in violation of DBM BC No. 2006-1.

**Legal Precision:**

*   The court primarily relies on interpretation of administrative regulations (DBM circulars) and jurisprudence established on good faith as a defense in disallowance cases. The outcome underscores the deference given to the COA's expertise, yet acknowledges exceptions based on principles of equity and fairness.
