**Legal Document Summary: Lazatin vs. Desierto, G.R. No. 147097 (2009)**

**Case Overview:** Petition for certiorari challenging the Ombudsman's disapproval of the Office of the Special Prosecutor's (OSP) resolution recommending dismissal of criminal charges against Petitioners for Malversation of Public Funds and violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act). The Ombudsman ordered the aggressive prosecution of cases against petitioners and the cases were then returned to the Sandiganbayan for continuation of criminal proceedings.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charges:** Illegal Use of Public Funds (Art. 220, RPC), Malversation of Public Funds, and violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019.
*   **Allegations:** Misuse of Countrywide Development Fund (CDF) by then Congressman Lazatin, including acting as both proponent and implementer of projects, signing disbursement vouchers, and receiving checks.
*   **OSP Resolution:** Initially recommended dismissal due to lack/insufficiency of evidence.
*   **Ombudsman's Action:** Disapproved OSP Resolution based on a review by the Office of Legal Affairs (OLA), ordering continued prosecution.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners' potential criminal liability for the alleged misuse of public funds.
*   Obligation of the prosecution (OSP, under the supervision of the Ombudsman) to present sufficient evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Criminal conviction and associated penalties (imprisonment, fines, disqualification from public office) for Petitioners.
*   Exposure to liability for the funds allegedly misused.
*   Continued legal expenses associated with defending the criminal charges.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Acop v. Office of the Ombudsman, G.R. No. 120422 (1995):** Upheld the constitutionality of R.A. No. 6770, affirming the Ombudsman's prosecutorial powers and control over the OSP based on Section 13, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution.
*   **Camanag v. Guerrero, G.R. No. 164250 (2005):** Reaffirms the constitutionality of R.A. No. 6770.

*   **Perez v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 166062 (2006):** The power to prosecute rests with the Ombudsman.
*   **Stare Decisis (Article 8, Civil Code):** Doctrine of adhering to precedents. The Court emphasizes the importance of maintaining judicial certainty and stability.

**Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   **Justification for Reimbursement:** Petitioners claim that the funds received were for reimbursement of advances made for Pinatubo victims. The validity and documentation of these reimbursements are critical and potentially contentious.
*   **Ombudsman's Discretion:** Whether the Ombudsman's disapproval of the OSP resolution constitutes grave abuse of discretion, requiring scrutiny of the evidence and basis for the Ombudsman's decision.
*   **Interpretation of "grave abuse of discretion"** Presidential Commission on Good Government v. Desierto lays out what constitutes such abuse.

**Potential Arguments:**

*   **Petitioners:** Argue the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of discretion in disapproving the OSP's resolution, asserting that the OSP's initial assessment of insufficient evidence was correct. They also argued R.A. No. 6770 is unconstitutional in that the Constitution does not allow the Ombudsman to have the power to prosecute.
*   **Ombudsman:** Will assert the validity of their authority under R.A. No. 6770 and the existence of probable cause based on the available evidence.

**Final Outcome:** The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the petition, upholding the constitutionality of R.A. No. 6770, adhering to the doctrine of *stare decisis* as established in *Acop v. Ombudsman*, and stating that the petition did not sufficiently show grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Ombudsman.
