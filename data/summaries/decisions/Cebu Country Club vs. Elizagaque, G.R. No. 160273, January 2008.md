**Legal Document Summary: *Cebu Country Club, Inc. vs. Elizagaque, G.R. No. 160273 (2008)***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming with modification the RTC decision, which found the Cebu Country Club (CCCI) and its directors liable for damages for disapproving Respondent Elizagaque's application for proprietary membership.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Membership Application & Disapproval:** Elizagaque applied for proprietary membership in CCCI. Despite purchasing a share and fulfilling initial requirements, his application was disapproved by the Board of Directors due to a "black ball" vote under the amended By-Laws requiring unanimous approval.
*   **Amended By-Laws:** The application form did *not* reflect the amended By-Laws requiring a unanimous vote for membership approval. This was the central issue.
*   **Lack of Communication:** CCCI did not inform Elizagaque of the reason for disapproval or the amended voting requirements, despite multiple inquiries from him.
*   **RTC & CA Decisions:** Both courts ruled in favor of Elizagaque, finding CCCI and its directors liable for damages. The CA affirmed the RTC decision, but reduced the damages awarded.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Obligation to Act in Good Faith:** The Supreme Court (SC) emphasizes the obligation of CCCI and its directors to act in good faith and with transparency in processing membership applications, even if they have the right to approve or disapprove.
*   **Liability for Abuse of Right:** The SC finds that the CCCI directors abused their right to approve/disapprove membership by (a) failing to disclose the crucial amendment to the By-Laws and (b) remaining silent after the application was denied, violating Articles 19 and 21 of the Civil Code (abuse of rights principle).
*   **Joint and Several Liability (Initially):** Both the RTC and CA initially imposed joint and several liability on the directors. The Supreme Court later modified the damages.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Bad Faith":** The determination of "bad faith" is often subjective and fact-dependent. Here, the SC relied heavily on the lack of transparency and communication.
*   **Corporate vs. Individual Liability:** The case touches on the potential for individual director liability for corporate actions, particularly where bad faith or willful misconduct is involved.
*   **Impact of By-Law Amendment:** The failure to update the application form with the amendment on voting procedures was a central factor in determining liability.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Articles 19 & 21:** These articles form the basis of the liability, outlining the principle of abuse of rights and the obligation to act with justice, honesty, and good faith.
*   ***GF Equity, Inc. v. Valenzona***: Expounds on Article 19 and its relationship to Article 21.
*   ***Amonoy v. Gutierrez***: Discusses the concept of *damnum absque injuria*.
*   **SEC. 31 of the Corporation Code:** Discusses the liabilities of directors.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   The SC affirmed the CA's decision but significantly reduced the amounts of moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses. This suggests that while the Court agreed with the finding of liability, it found the initial damage awards excessive. The rationale was the lack of transparency in informing Elizagaque of the reason for denial and the black ball system.
*   **Rationale:** The SC found that the club acted in bad faith and violated the principles of human relations.

**Overall Implications:**

This case serves as a reminder to corporations and their directors that the exercise of corporate rights, even if legally permissible, must be done fairly, transparently, and with due regard to the rights of others. Failure to disclose material information or acting arbitrarily can lead to liability for damages under the principle of abuse of rights.
