## Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 202612

**Case:** *Teodoro C. Tortona, et al. v. Julian C. Gregorio, et al.*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding the validity of a Deed of Absolute Sale.

**Key Issue:**  Whether the Deed of Absolute Sale, purportedly executed by Rufina Casimiro (represented by Petitioners), is void due to forgery of her thumbprint.

**Ruling:** Supreme Court reverses the Court of Appeals and reinstates the Regional Trial Court's decision, declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale void due to forgery.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Forgery:** The core finding is that Rufina Casimiro's thumbprint on the Deed of Absolute Sale was forged. This determination was based on:
    *   Expert testimony of NBI Fingerprint Examiner Eriberto B. Gomez, Jr. who concluded in his first report that there were inconsistencies in the fingerprint patterns.
    *   Comparison of thumbprints on the deed against standard documents with Rufina's authentic thumbprints, even though there were some clarity issues with the reference thumbprints.
    *   The Trial Court's own comparison of the thumbprints lead to the determination that the ridge characteristics of the fingerprints were different.
*   **Notarization:** While a notarized document enjoys a presumption of regularity, this presumption is rebuttable by clear and convincing evidence, which Petitioners successfully presented.
*   **Expert Testimony:** The Court emphasized the importance of expert testimony in document examination, rejecting Respondents' attempts to discredit the NBI examiner as "just an ordinary employee." The court relied on expert witness Gomez's conclusion that the thumbprints did not match standard documents.
*   **Credibility of Notary Public:** The credibility of the notary public, Atty. Arcadia Espiritu, was undermined by his previous notarization of a false affidavit of self-adjudication, demonstrating a disregard for truthfulness in notarial acts. This diminishes the weight of the notarization.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents:** The Gregorio heirs are obligated to return the properties (or the equivalent value) derived from the invalid sale. They are also potentially liable for any damages arising from their fraudulent actions.
*   **Register of Deeds:** Ordered to cancel TCT No. T-741726 and revert to the cancelled OCT No. O-923, and to cancel Entry No. 8449-75 appearing on TCT No. T-10058, which is the annotation of the questioned Deed of Absolute Sale (Exhibit "D") that has been declared herein as null and void and inexistent.
*   **Atty. Espiritu:**  Potentially liable for disciplinary action for notarizing a document with a forged signature, breaching his duty to ascertain the genuineness of the signatures.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation of the Property:** If the properties cannot be returned in their original state, a dispute may arise regarding their fair market value at the time of the transaction or at present.
*   **Damages:**  While the trial court initially denied damages, Petitioners could potentially pursue a separate action for damages now that the forgery has been conclusively established.
*   **Clarity issues with reference thumbprints:** While the court did address these issues, they could potentially be brought up again when enforcing the ruling or dealing with subsequent litigation.

**Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   While addressed in the decision, the Court of Appeals did find that the NBI examiners findings and conclusions conflicted. There might be other discrepancies that could lead to more disputes.
*   The Deed of Absolute Sale was not referred to the NBI for examination prior to filing a Motion with the Court. Respondent argued the original questioned document came from an illegitimate and spurious source.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court has firmly sided with the Petitioners, providing a strong precedent for challenging notarized documents where forgery is suspected. The key takeaway is that the presumption of regularity in notarization can be overcome with clear and convincing evidence, particularly when supported by expert testimony and a lack of credibility on the part of the notary public. The court found that the totality of the evidence (the expert's testimony and the circumstances surrounding the notarization) demonstrated that the evidence was not clearly and convincingly overcome.
