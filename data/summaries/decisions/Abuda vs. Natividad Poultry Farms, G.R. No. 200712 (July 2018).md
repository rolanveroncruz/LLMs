## Legal Document Summary: *Abuda v. L. Natividad Poultry Farms* (G.R. No. 200712)

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding the employment status and alleged illegal dismissal of workers (Petitioners) against L. Natividad Poultry Farms, Juliana Natividad, and Merlinda Natividad (Respondents). The Supreme Court (SC) ruled that the maintenance personnel were regular employees, reversing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision in part.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The SC affirmed the findings of the lower tribunals that L. Natividad was the *de facto* employer of the Petitioners, despite the apparent involvement of San Mateo General Services and Rodolfo Del Remedios (Del Remedios). The SC cited *Rhone-Poulenc Agrochemicals Phil., Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission* for the four-fold test in determining the relationship, particularly emphasizing L. Natividad's control over the workers, as seen in attendance sheets and specific task assignments.
*   **Labor-Only Contracting:** The CA correctly determined that San Mateo and Del Remedios were engaged in labor-only contracting, making them agents of L. Natividad. This is based on Article 106 of the Labor Code and case law like *Maraguinot, Jr. v. National Labor Relations Commission*, highlighting the lack of substantial capital or investment by the contractors.
*   **Regular Employment Status:** The SC declared certain Petitioners (Rodolfo Del Remedios, Edwardo Del Remedios, Dionisio Adlawan, Elpidio Garcia, Jr., Rogelio Zamora, Sr., Jimmy Torres, Policarpio Obanel, Jose Fernando, Johnny Betache, Jayson Garcia, Edwin Espe, Nemencio Cruz, Larry Aba単es, Rolando Salen, Francisco Lim, Arnaldo Garcia, Mario Abuda, Rodolfo Zamora) to be regular employees based on two grounds under Article 295 [280] of the Labor Code and case law like *De Leon v. National Labor Relations Commission*:
    *   **Duration of Service:** The Petitioners worked for L. Natividad for periods ranging from 3 to 17 years. The court inferred the necessity/desirability of their work based on the length of their continuous service.
    *   **Nature of Work:** The SC found that maintenance and repair of the poultry farms, facilities, and sales outlets were *necessary and desirable* to L. Natividad's business.
*   **Task Basis (Pakyaw) Payment:** The SC held that payment on a *pakyaw* or task basis doesn't negate regular employment status. This is based on Articles 97(f) and 101 of the Labor Code and supported by *David v. Macasio*, which establishes that the *pakyaw* arrangement merely defines the manner of wage payment.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The SC ruled that Petitioners were illegally dismissed. *Gapayao v. Fulo* supports this. The court ordered reinstatement and payment of full backwages and benefits, subject to computation by the Labor Arbiter.
*   **Moral and Exemplary Damages:** The SC denied the award of moral and exemplary damages, citing *Philippine School of Business Administration v. National Labor Relations Commission*. The Petitioners failed to sufficiently demonstrate bad faith, oppression, or malice in their dismissal beyond the mere lack of just cause or due process.
*   **Other Claimants (Bronola et al):** The SC upheld the finding that Bro単ola, Gonzales, Martinez, Jeremias, Arnel, Nawal, and Eduardo were *not* illegally dismissed, despite their regular employment status. The remedy for that case is reinstatement without backwages.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   L. Natividad Poultry Farms is obligated to:
    *   Reinstate Rodolfo Del Remedios, Edwardo Del Remedios, Dionisio Adlawan, Elpidio Garcia, Jr., Rogelio Zamora, Sr., Jimmy Torres, Policarpio Obanel, Jose Fernando, Johnny Betache, Jayson Garcia, Edwin Espe, Nemencio Cruz, Larry Aba単es, Rolando Salen, Francisco Lim, Arnaldo Garcia, Mario Abuda, Rodolfo Zamora.
    *   Pay these Petitioners backwages, allowances, and other benefits from the time of illegal dismissal until actual reinstatement.
    *   Pay Bro単ola, Gonzales, Martinez, Jeremias, Arnel, Nawal, and Eduardo their 13th month pay and service incentive leave pay, if any.
    *   Pay 6% interest per annum on monetary awards from the date of finality of the decision.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Computation of Backwages:** The calculation of backwages and other monetary awards by the Labor Arbiter could be contentious, requiring precise documentation of past earnings and benefits.
*   **Reinstatement Practicality:** The practicality of reinstating employees after a significant period may present challenges, particularly in terms of the employer's current operations and the employees' current skills and circumstances.
*   **Proof of Monetary claims** It is possible some petitioners would have a hard time substantiating proof of hours and other compensable monetary claims.
