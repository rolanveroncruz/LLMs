## Legal Document Summary: *Mangahas v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 173375

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) dismissal of a Petition for Certiorari due to late filing and improper service. The underlying case involves a criminal charge against municipal councilors (Petitioners) for violation of Section 3(f) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 3(f):** The core charge against Petitioners, alleging they neglected or refused to act on a pending matter (Kapasyahan Blg. 39) after due demand, without sufficient justification, discriminating against Dr. Celia Morales. The "pending matter" refers to the failure to attend a hearing.
*   **Alleged Offense:** Petitioners, as municipal councilors, allegedly failed to attend a public hearing regarding the conversion of agricultural land into a memorial garden, thereby giving undue advantage to the landowners and discriminating against the complainant, Dr. Morales.
*   **Procedural Issue: Timeliness of CA Petition:** The CA dismissed the Petition for Certiorari because it was filed one day late. The Supreme Court (SC) focuses primarily on the factual determination of the mailing date.
*   **Procedural Issue: Service on OSG:** The CA also cited Petitioners' failure to serve the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) with a copy of the petition, instead serving the Provincial Prosecutor. This is deemed a fatal defect.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Statutory Obligation:** Under RA 3019 Section 3f to act with reasonable time and care for matters of public office and in public hearings.
*   **Procedural Obligations:** Strict adherence to procedural rules, including timely filing of petitions and proper service on the OSG as the government's counsel in appellate proceedings. Citing Rules 45 and 46 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Criminal Liability:** Potential conviction under RA 3019, Section 3(f) if the elements are proven.
*   **Preventive Suspension:** As per Section 63(b) of the Local Government Code, the RTC ordered a 60-day preventive suspension of Petitioners from their public offices.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute on Mailing Date:** The SC highlights the evidentiary challenges faced by Petitioners in proving the actual mailing date of their CA Petition. The reliance on photocopies, affidavits from post office employees notarized by the same law firm, and the absence of the original registry receipt are deemed insufficient.
*   **Validity of Information:** Petitioners argued that the Information filed with the RTC was invalid because it was not signed by the government prosecutor on the date it was filed. The SC does not reach a conclusive finding of this issue.
*   **Pre-Suspension Hearing:** Petitioners argued that the trial court should have conducted a pre-suspension hearing citing *Santiago v. Sandiganbayan*. Again, The SC does not reach a conclusive finding on this issue.
*   **Ethical Concerns:** The SC expresses concerns about the conduct of Petitioners' counsel, suggesting a lack of sincerity in dealings with the courts due to the questionable evidentiary support for the mailing date.
*   **Ambiguity:** The decision relies on the Court of Appeals conclusion, not a de novo review on the facts.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Section 3(f):** Defines the offense charged against the Petitioners.
*   **Rules 45 and 46 of the Rules of Court:** Governs the procedure for Petition for Review on Certiorari and original actions in the appellate court, including service requirements.
*   **Section 63(b) of the Local Government Code:** Pertains to preventive suspension of local elective officials.
*   ***Santiago v. Sandiganbayan*, 356 SCRA 636:** Cited by Petitioners regarding the requirement of a pre-suspension hearing.
*   ***Salazar v. Romaquin*, G.R. No. 151068:** Clarifies that the OSG represents the People of the Philippines in appeals before the CA and SC.
*   ***Go v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 163745:** Reinforces the requirement of service on the OSG.
*   **PhilPost Administrative Order No. 05-17:** Discusses fees for the certification of post office records.

**Conclusion:** The SC upheld the CA's dismissal based on procedural grounds, primarily the late filing of the Petition for Certiorari and failure to properly serve the OSG. The Court refused to address the substantive issues raised by Petitioners, emphasizing the factual nature of the mailing date dispute and the binding nature of the CA's factual findings. The Court also emphasized the need for strict compliance with procedural rules and expressed concerns about the conduct of Petitioners' counsel. The decision emphasizes the importance of timely filing and service to the correct parties.
