## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Castillo*, G.R. No. 120282 (1998)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Robert Castillo of murder.

**Key Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the conviction for murder, qualified by treachery, but deleted the award of actual and moral damages due to lack of evidentiary basis.

**Facts:** Appellant Castillo was convicted by the RTC for stabbing Antonio Dometita, resulting in Dometita's death. The prosecution presented eyewitness testimony that Castillo stabbed Dometita without warning. The defense presented evidence of a separate incident and alibi.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Elements of Murder:**  The amended information alleged intent to kill, qualified by evident premeditation, use of superior strength and treachery.
*   **Treachery:** Defined as the employment of means, methods, or forms of execution that give the victim no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate, which were deliberately and consciously adopted by the accused without danger to his person.
*   **Abuse of Superior Strength:** Requires proof that the assailant purposely used excessive force out of proportion to the means of defense available to the person attacked.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellant is obligated to serve a sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Appellant is obligated to pay the heirs of the deceased P50,000 as civil indemnity.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for murder.
*   Civil liability for the victim's death.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The case hinged on the credibility of witnesses. The defense attempted to introduce evidence of a separate incident and alibi, which were rejected by the court.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:**  The RTC initially found abuse of superior strength, but the SC found the killing was qualified by treachery. The prosecution failed to prove evident premeditation.
*   **Damages:** The original award of actual and moral damages was deemed unsubstantiated by evidence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Elements of Treachery:**  The Court reiterated its established jurisprudence regarding the elements necessary to establish treachery (citing *People vs. Maalat*, GR No. 109814, July 8, 1997 and *People vs. Tuson*, GR No. 106345-46, September 16, 1996)
*   **Elements of Evident Premeditation:**  The Court reiterates its established jurisprudence regarding the elements necessary to establish evident premeditation (citing *People vs. Baydo*, supra; People vs. Halili, 245 SCRA 340, June 27, 1995).
*   **Role of Trial Judge:**  The Court emphasized that a trial judge has the prerogative and duty to ask clarificatory questions to ferret out the truth, so long as it is not prejudiced (citing *People vs. Tabarno*, 242 SCRA 456, March 20, 1995).
* **Defense of Alibi:** The Court emphasized that an alibi must not only prove that the defendant was somewhere else but also that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime (citing *People vs. Umali*, 242 SCRA 17, March 1, 1995).

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:**  The SC upheld the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, giving weight to the prosecution's eyewitness testimony.
*   **Judge's Impartiality:** The appellant's claim of judicial bias was rejected because the judge's questioning was found to be clarificatory and non-prejudicial.

**Conclusion:** The SC affirmed the conviction of Robert Castillo for murder qualified by treachery, emphasizing the importance of eyewitness testimony and the trial court's assessment of credibility. The deletion of the actual and moral damages underscores the need for proper documentation and proof when claiming damages.
