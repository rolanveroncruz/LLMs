**Legal Document Summary: *National Power Corporation v. Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 171176, September 04, 2009 (614 Phil. 506)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision which upheld the RTC's order requiring NPC to pay not only the garnished amount, but also interests and bank charges.

**Key Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** National Power Corporation (NPC)
*   **Respondent:** Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank (PCIB)

**Factual Background:** PCIB obtained a judgment against B.R. Sebastian & Associates, Inc. (Sebastian).  Sebastian subsequently obtained a favorable judgment against NPC. PCIB sought to garnish Sebastian's judgment against NPC to satisfy the original judgment. NPC made a partial payment but refused to pay the full amount including interests and bank charges.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**
*   **Garnishment:** NPC was served with a Notice of Garnishment on July 21, 1976, attaching Sebastian's judgment against NPC to satisfy Sebastian's debt to PCIB.  Pursuant to Rule 39, Sec. 9(c), NPC, as garnishee, is obligated to deliver the credits to the proper officer.
*   **NPC's Obligation:** NPC is obligated to satisfy the judgment rendered against Sebastian in favor of PCIB, *including* interests and bank charges as stipulated in the original judgment against Sebastian in Civil Case No. 79092.
*   **Interest and Bank Charges:** The crux of the dispute centers on whether NPC is liable for interest and bank charges on the garnished amount, in addition to the principal. The Court affirms that NPC is liable for *all* interests and bank charges accumulated on the remaining amount due from July 21, 1976, until full payment.

**Liabilities:** NPC is liable to PCIB for the outstanding balance of the garnished amount, plus interest at 14% per annum and penalty at 12% per annum from July 21, 1976, until fully paid.  The Court also imposes double costs against NPC.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Jurisdictional Challenge (Rejected):** NPC argued lack of jurisdiction, claiming it was not a party to the original case between PCIB and Sebastian. The Court held that service of the writ of garnishment made NPC a "virtual party" or "forced intervenor," conferring jurisdiction.
*   **Scope of Garnishment:** NPC contended its liability was limited to the amount specified in the Notice of Garnishment, excluding interests and bank charges.  The Court rejected this, stating the Notice must be construed in light of the underlying judgment against Sebastian, which included those charges.
*   **Delay Tactics:** The Court explicitly admonished NPC for employing delay tactics, observing that it had avoided its obligation for over 30 years.  This suggests the Court is inclined to interpret ambiguities against NPC and potentially sanction further obstructive behavior.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**
*   **Rule 39, Section 9(c) of the Rules of Court:** Defines the procedure and scope of garnishment.
*   **Tayabas Land Co. v. Sharruf, 41 Phil. 382 (1921):**  Establishes that a garnishee becomes a forced intervenor in the case.
*   **RCBC v. de Castro, G.R. No. L-34548, November 29, 1988, 168 SCRA 49:** Defines garnishment and the garnishee's obligation.
*   **Banogan et al v. Zerna, et al.:** Reiterates that litigation must end.

**Conclusion:**
The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, finding NPC liable for the outstanding balance, interest, and bank charges. NPC's arguments based on lack of jurisdiction and limited liability were rejected.  The Court signaled its disapproval of NPC's delaying tactics and warned against further abuse of court processes. The risk for NPC is continued accrual of interest and penalties and potential sanctions for further delaying tactics.
