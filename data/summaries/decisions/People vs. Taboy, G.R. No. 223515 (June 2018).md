## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Taboy*, G.R. No. 223515 (2018)

This Supreme Court decision addresses the appeal of Francis Taboy y Aquino (Accused-Appellant) from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale), 12 (illegal possession of drug paraphernalia), and 15 (illegal use of dangerous drugs) of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs):** The Court affirms the conviction, finding all elements present: identification of seller (Accused-Appellant) and buyer (PO2 Navero), consideration (P500.00 marked money), and delivery of *shabu*. The chain of custody of the seized drug was deemed unbroken.
*   **Section 12, RA 9165 (Illegal Possession of Drug Paraphernalia):** The Court reverses the conviction. The prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt because there were inconsistencies as regards the actual paraphernalia confiscated and the chain of custody was not established.
*   **Section 15, RA 9165 (Illegal Use of Dangerous Drugs):** The Court affirms the conviction, based on the positive drug test result for methamphetamine after Accused-Appellant's arrest.

**Obligations:**

*   **Law Enforcement:** To properly conduct buy-bust operations, observe the chain of custody requirements under Section 21 of RA 9165, and ensure accurate and consistent documentation of seized items.
*   **Accused:** To comply with drug testing procedures and face penalties for violations of RA 9165.

**Liabilities:**

*   Accused-Appellant remains liable for illegal sale of dangerous drugs (life imprisonment and a P500,000 fine) and illegal use of dangerous drugs (six months rehabilitation).
*   Accused-Appellant is relieved of liability for illegal possession of drug paraphernalia.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The case highlights the critical importance of strictly adhering to the chain of custody rule under Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640. Failure to meticulously document each step, particularly the marking, inventory, and proper turnover of seized items, can lead to acquittal. *People v. Arposeple*, G.R. No. 205787, November 22, 2017, is cited concerning the implications of chain of custody failure.
*   **Inconsistencies in Evidence:** Discrepancies in the description and enumeration of seized items create reasonable doubt and can undermine the prosecution's case, as evidenced by the acquittal on the drug paraphernalia charge.
*   **Reliance on Presumption of Regularity:** The Court relies on the presumption that police officers regularly performed their duties in the buy-bust operation. While this presumption can support a conviction, it is rebuttable if there is evidence of irregularity or ill motive. *People v. Cutara*, G.R. No. 224300, June 7, 2017 is cited.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sections 5, 12, 15, 21:** Central law governing the case.
