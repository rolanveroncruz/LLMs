## Legal Document Summary: *Lazaro V. Dacut* G.R. No. 169434

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of CA decision affirming NLRC resolution, which affirmed Labor Arbiter decision dismissing complaint for constructive dismissal but awarding limited monetary claims.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Constructive Dismissal Claim:** Petitioners claim constructive dismissal due to vessel unseaworthiness (Dacut & Tungala) and replacement during leave (Cajote).
*   **Monetary Claims:** Petitioners claim underpayment of wages, special and regular holidays, non-payment of rest days, sick and vacation leaves, night shift differentials, subsistence allowance, and fixed overtime pay.
*   **Labor Arbiter Ruling:** Dismissed constructive dismissal claim but awarded holiday pay, accrued sick/vacation leave, and Zubista's wage differential.
*   **NLRC and CA Affirmed:** Upheld the Labor Arbiter's decision.
*   **Court Ruling:** Denied the petition, affirming the CA's decision.

**Obligations:**

*   Employer (Sta. Clara) has the obligation to pay the previously awarded monetary benefits including holiday pay, accrued sick leave/vacation leave credits, and Zubista's wage differential.
* Employees have the obligation to provide sufficient evidence to prove their entitlement to overtime pay or night shift differential

**Liabilities:**

*   Employer is liable for the unpaid holiday pay, accrued sick/vacation leave credits, and Zubista's wage differential as determined by the Labor Arbiter.
*   No liability found for constructive dismissal, overtime, night shift differentials, or other monetary claims.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Procedural Issue (Reply Admission):** The Labor Arbiter's admission of the employer's reply after submission was challenged as denying petitioners a chance to refute. While the court deemed this acceptable given latitude in labor cases, it could be a point of contention depending on specific circumstances and potential prejudice to petitioners.
*   **Constructive Dismissal vs. Voluntary Resignation:** The core dispute revolves around whether the resignations were voluntary or a result of intolerable working conditions (constructive dismissal). This hinges on factual findings, which the Court deferred to the lower tribunals.
* **Monetary Claims:** Employee failed to provide sufficient evidence that overtime and night shift were actually performed. This is a requirement by law.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Defines the scope of review on certiorari (questions of law only).
*   **Labor Code:** Governs labor relations and employee rights.
*   **Tiu v. Pasaol, Sr., G.R. No. 139876, April 30, 2003:** Establishes that technical rules of procedure are not binding in labor cases.
*   **Legahi v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 122240, November 18, 1999:** Correct criterion for determining if employee is entitled to overtime pay or night shift differential

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The circumstances surrounding the alleged promises of separation pay by Orlina (Personnel Manager's secretary) and the Operations Manager are ambiguous. The Court questioned Orlina's authority and treated the Operations Manager's statement as an alternative to AWOL charges.
* The alleged harassment claim was only presented at the NLRC, without any evidence or incidents to prove this point.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions, finding that the petitioners voluntarily resigned and were not constructively dismissed. The employer is only liable for the previously awarded holiday pay, accrued sick/vacation leave, and wage differential. The decision emphasizes the deference given to factual findings of labor tribunals and adherence to procedural flexibility in labor cases. The main risk point for the petitioners was the inability to prove their claims for constructive dismissal and other monetary benefits due to insufficient evidence.
