Here's a legal summary of the provided decision, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Nestorio W. Laya and Rudy Martin vs. Spouses Edwin and Lourdes Triviño* (G.R. No. 158965, April 14, 2008)

**Subject Matter:** Zoning Ordinance violation, HLURB jurisdiction, Estoppel

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Zoning Dispute:** Spouses Triviño, owners of a residential unit in La Pacita Complex Subdivision, San Pedro, Laguna, expanded their mini-grocery store, prompting renovation.  Neighbors (Laya and Martin) objected, claiming the building permit violated the San Pedro Zoning Ordinance prohibiting commercial buildings in R-1 residential zones.
*   **Permits Obtained:** Triviños secured a Zoning Certification, Homeowners Association and Barangay clearances, Fire Safety inspection.
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   Homeowners initially complained to the Mayor's Office.
    *   Then filed an appeal with HLURB Regional Field Office which was dismissed.
    *   HLURB Board of Commissioners issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) preventing commercial use, pending resolution, conditioned on petitioners posting a 100k injunction bond.
    *   Court of Appeals (CA) set aside the HLURB Order, dismissing the case for lack of merit.
    *   This Supreme Court petition followed.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals' decision, reinstating the HLURB Board of Commissioners' Order and directing the board to hear the merits of petitioners' Verified Petition For Review.

**Key Legal Issues and Rationale:**

1.  **HLURB Jurisdiction:** The Court held that the HLURB Board of Commissioners has the power to hear appeals from HLURB Regional Field Offices. They cite Executive Order No. 648, Article IV, Section 5 (f) and (p), and Rule XII, Section 1 of the HLURB Rules of Procedure, R-655, series of 1999.
2.  **Estoppel:**  The Court found that the Triviños were estopped from challenging the HLURB Regional Field Office's jurisdiction because they actively participated in the proceedings without raising the issue until after an unfavorable ruling. This is based on the principle that actively participating in a proceeding without objection constitutes an invocation of jurisdiction. (Citing *David v. Cordova*, G.R. No. 152992, July 28, 2005 and *Heirs of the Late Panfilo V. Pajarillo v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. Nos. 155056-57, October 19, 2007).
3.  **Merits of Zoning Violation:** The Court declined to rule on the zoning violation issue, considering it a factual matter best resolved by the HLURB Board.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Injunction Bond:** The original HLURB order was conditioned on Laya and Martin posting an injunction bond. Failure to do so could lift the injunction against the Triviños.
*   **Definition of "Previously Existing" and "Compatible":** The HLURB's order allowed "commercial activities other than those previously existing and on a scale engaged in prior to the renovation" if "deemed compatible with the character of the area." This language is vague and could lead to further disputes about the scope of permissible commercial use.
*   **Outcome of HLURB Review:** The central dispute over whether the Triviños' renovation violates the San Pedro Zoning Ordinance remains unresolved. The Supreme Court's decision only addresses procedural issues. The HLURB Board must now determine whether the construction is permissible under the Ordinance.

**Statutory References:**

*   Executive Order No. 648 (Powers and Duties of HLURB)
*   San Pedro, Laguna Zoning Ordinance
*   HLURB Rules of Procedure, Rule XII, Section 1 (as amended by HLURB Resolution No. R-655, Series of 1999)

**Case Law:**

*   *David v. Cordova*, G.R. No. 152992, July 28, 2005
*   *Heirs of the Late Panfilo V. Pajarillo v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. Nos. 155056-57, October 19, 2007

**For the Lawyer:**

This case primarily addresses procedural issues regarding jurisdiction and estoppel in zoning disputes before the HLURB. The key takeaway is the application of estoppel, which is the waiver of a legal defense through conduct, in preventing parties from challenging the jurisdiction of a body after actively participating in its proceedings. The actual zoning dispute itself has not yet been resolved on its merits.
