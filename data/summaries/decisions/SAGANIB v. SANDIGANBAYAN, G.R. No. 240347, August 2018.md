**Legal Document Summary: *In Re: Correction/ Adjustment of Penalty Pursuant to Republic Act No. 10951, In Relation to Hernan v. Sandiganbayan, Samuel Saganib y Lutong***

**Case Citation:** 838 Phil. 631 (G.R. No. 240347, August 14, 2018)

**Nature:** Resolution on a Petition for Release based on R.A. No. 10951 and *Hernan v. Sandiganbayan*.

**Facts:** Samuel Saganib y Lutong (Petitioner) was convicted of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) for defrauding complainants by posing as a lawyer and taking P100,000.00. The RTC sentenced him to 5 years *prision correccional* minimum to 9 years *prision mayor* maximum, plus damages. Petitioner now seeks to have his sentence modified and be released based on R.A. No. 10951, which adjusts penalties based on the amount of fraud.  The RTC decision became final and executory.

**Issue:** Is petitioner entitled to have his sentence modified in accordance with R.A. No. 10951 and be released immediately from confinement?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) *granted* the petition in part, remanding the case to the RTC to determine the correct penalty under R.A. No. 10951 and whether the petitioner is entitled to immediate release.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **R.A. No. 10951 (Amendments to RPC):** The SC considered Section 85 amending Article 315 (Estafa) of the RPC, lowering the penalty for estafa involving amounts over P40,000 but not exceeding P1,200,000.00 to *arresto mayor* in its maximum period to *prision correccional* in its minimum period.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** The SC implicitly relies on the Indeterminate Sentence Law for its ability to modify sentences.
*   **RTC Obligations on Remand:** The RTC is obligated to:
    *   Determine the new penalty under R.A. No. 10951.
    *   Calculate time served, including Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA).
    *   Determine if the petitioner has fully served the modified sentence and is entitled to immediate release.
*   **Guidelines for Similar Petitions:** The SC also lays out guidelines for the filing and resolution of similar petitions including the requirement of filing with the RTC and requiring the OSG to comment on the petition.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Liability:** Retains a criminal liability for Estafa. The extent of this liability remains subject to the re-computation by the RTC.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **GCTA Calculation:** The determination of GCTA is fact-specific and potentially contentious, impacting the eligibility for immediate release.
*   **RTC Discretion:** The RTC retains discretion in determining the appropriate penalty within the range prescribed by R.A. No. 10951 and how GCTA is applied.
*   **Appeal:** The Resolution indicates that the judgment of the court shall be immediately executory, without prejudice to the filing before the Supreme Court of a special civil action under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court where there is a showing of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (Act No. 3815), Art. 315 (Estafa):**  The core offense at issue.
*   **Republic Act No. 10951:** The basis for the sentence modification request.
*   ***Hernan v. Sandiganbayan*:** Cited as precedent for reopening terminated cases to modify penalties under R.A. No. 10951, although that reliance is qualified by *In Re: Correction/Adjustment of Penalty pursuant to R.A. No. 10951 in Relation to Hernan v. Sandiganbayan - Rolando Elbanbuena y Marfil*
*    ***In Re: Correction/Adjustment of Penalty pursuant to R.A. No. 10951 in Relation to Hernan v. Sandiganbayan - Rolando Elbanbuena y Marfil*:** (G.R. No. 237721, July 31, 2018) which states the court is not equipped to make findings of both fact and law

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

1.  **Focus on Mitigation:** Argue for the minimum possible penalty within the range allowed by R.A. No. 10951.
2.  **Maximize GCTA:**  Present evidence to support the maximum possible GCTA credit.
3.  **Expedite RTC Proceedings:** Ensure the RTC adheres to the timelines outlined in the SC guidelines.
