## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Malapo, G.R. No. 123115 (August 25, 1998)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision - Appeal of Rape Conviction

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime:** Rape (Art. 335, Revised Penal Code, before amendment by Rep. Act No. 7659) â€“ Carnal knowledge by force and intimidation.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   Moral Damages: P50,000.00 to the victim.
    *   Indemnity: P50,000.00 to the victim (Civil Indemnity fixed by the Supreme Court).
    *   Support for Offspring: Determination of amount by RTC after hearing (Art. 345, RPC).
*   **Alibi Defense:** Accused claimed he was working elsewhere during the time of the crime.

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused (Malapo):**
    *   Serve sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
    *   Pay moral damages and indemnity to the victim.
    *   Acknowledge filiation of the child.
    *   Provide support for the child, amount to be determined by the RTC.
*   **RTC (Iriga City, Branch 36):**
    *   Fix the amount of support to be paid by the accused to the victim for the child.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal:** Accused found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape.
*   **Civil:** Accused held liable for damages (moral and indemnity) and support of offspring.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Alibi Disproved:** The alibi defense was weak and contradicted by the accused's own witnesses who testified the accused would occasionally visit his family.
*   **Identification Issue:** Accused argues inconsistencies in victim's identification, however, the Court gives weight to the trial court's observation of the witnesses and credibility of the victim.
*   **Pregnancy Timeline Argument:** Accused argued that the full-term birth of the baby was impossible given the date of the alleged rape. The Court rejected this argument based on pediatric textbook definition of full-term and relevant Family Code provision on legitimacy.
*   **Victim's Mental Capacity:** The victim was described as a "retardate," but the Court finds her testimony credible, citing case law *People v. Quinones* which found the date of the incident irrelevant and that proof of the crime itself carries more weight.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Alib (222 SCRA 517, 1993):** Emphasizes that pregnancy is not an element of rape. Carnal knowledge under the specified circumstances (force, intimidation, deprivation of reason, minority) is sufficient.
*   **People v. Quinones (222 SCRA 249, 1993):** Regarding the rape of a retardate and the non-essentiality of the specific date of the offense.
*   **People v. Rafanan (182 SCRA 811, 1990):** Relating to conception timelines in relation to criminal offenses.
*   **People v. Bayani (262 SCRA 660, 1996):**  Regarding parental authority over illegitimate children under the Family Code.
*   **People v. Errojo (229 SCRA 49, 1994):** Concerning the understanding of acknowledgment in cases of rape.
*   **People v. Victor, G.R. No. 127903, July 9, 1998:** About the increase to the Civil Indemnity
*   **People v. Prades, G.R. No. 127569, July 30, 1998:** Regarding moral damages in rape cases.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):**
    *   Art. 335 (before amendment): Definition and penalty for rape.
    *   Art. 345: Support for offspring in rape cases.
*   **Family Code:**
    *   Art. 166: Impugning legitimacy of a child.
    *   Art. 176: Parental authority over illegitimate children.
    *   Art. 201: Determination of amount and terms of support.
    *   Art. 165:  The illegitimate child of the accused.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The exact date of the rape is not established, but the court deems this not crucial to the conviction given the victim's mental condition and the nature of the offense.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction for rape, emphasizing the victim's credible testimony, the disproved alibi, and the legal sufficiency of the elements of rape even without pregnancy. The case highlights the vulnerabilities of individuals with diminished mental capacity and provides a clear directive on the civil liabilities arising from rape convictions, including support for offspring. The key risk remains the enforcement of the support obligation, which requires further action by the RTC.
