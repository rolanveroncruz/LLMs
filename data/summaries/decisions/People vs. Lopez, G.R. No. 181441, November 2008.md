**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Larry Lopez*, G.R. No. 181441, involves an appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Larry Lopez for violations of Sections 5 (sale of dangerous drugs) and 11 (possession of dangerous drugs) of Republic Act No. 9165 (RA 9165), the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

**Key Provisions & Charges:**

*   **Criminal Case No. 3188 (Section 5, RA 9165):** Sale of 0.06 grams of *shabu* (methamphetamine hydrochloride) to a poseur buyer for P500.
*   **Criminal Case No. 3189 (Section 11, RA 9165):** Possession of 6.20 grams of dried marijuana leaves and fruiting tops.

**Facts:**

*   A buy-bust operation was conducted based on information received by the police regarding the appellant's drug peddling activities.
*   The appellant allegedly sold *shabu* to a confidential agent, who then handed the marked money to the appellant.
*   The appellant was arrested, and a subsequent warrantless search revealed marijuana in his possession.
*   The appellant claimed frame-up, alleging he was simply driving his tricycle when arrested.

**RTC Ruling:**

*   Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5, RA 9165: Life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.
*   Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 11, RA 9165: Imprisonment of 14 years and a fine of P300,000.

**CA Ruling:**

*   Affirmed the RTC's decision.
*   Rejected inconsistencies raised by the appellant as trivial.
*   Upheld the validity of the warrantless search as incidental to a lawful arrest under Rule 126, Section 12 (erroneously cited Section 13).
*   Cited the lack of evidence of any ulterior motive for the police officers to falsely charge the appellant of the offenses, thus rejected the frame-up theory.

**Supreme Court (SC) Ruling:**

*   Affirmed the CA decision with modification
*   Found inconsistencies in PO1 Miranda testimony to be minor and did not impair integrity of prosecution's evidence.
*   Stated that the frame-up theory was an afterthought
*   Stated that the trial court is in a better position to determine a witness's deportment.
*   Reiterated existing jurisprudence that a buy-bust operation is a form of entrapment.

**Key Issues:**

*   Whether the appellant was guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 5 and 11 of RA 9165.
*   Validity of the warrantless search.
*   Credibility of prosecution witnesses.
*   Sufficiency of evidence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The appellant is liable for the penalties prescribed under Sections 5 and 11 of RA 9165 for the crimes of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs.

*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:**  While the SC characterized the inconsistencies as minor, aggressive cross-examination could exploit these discrepancies to undermine the credibility of the police officers.
*   **Framing of the accused:**  The accused was not able to successfully defend himself against the charges.
*   **Warrantless search:** The validity of the search hinged on the lawfulness of the arrest.
