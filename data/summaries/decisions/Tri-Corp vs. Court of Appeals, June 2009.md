## Legal Document Summary: *Tri-Corp Land & Development, Inc. v. Court of Appeals and Greystone Corporation* (G.R. No. 165742)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, challenging the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the RTC's dismissal of Tri-Corp's petition for Correction of Error/Misrepresentation in Master Deed.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contract to Sell:** Greystone sold a condominium unit to Tri-Corp. Tri-Corp was later denied membership in the homeowner's association due to violations of village restrictions regarding the condominium construction.
*   **Conflicting Descriptions:** Tri-Corp alleges Greystone used varying descriptions of the project to obtain different permits.
*   **HLURB Case:** SMVHA filed a case against Greystone before the HLURB (HLURB Case No. REM-10045) regarding the construction violations. Tri-Corp intervened seeking suspension of payments. Tri-Corp also filed a separate case before HLURB against Greystone (Cancellation of License).
*   **Ejectment Suit:** Greystone filed an ejectment suit against Tri-Corp for failure to pay. Tri-Corp was ejected, and the case is pending appeal.
*   **RTC Petition:** Tri-Corp filed a petition in the RTC (sitting as a Land Registration Court, LRC Case No. M-4086) for correction of error/misrepresentation in the Master Deed, arguing Greystone misrepresented the project to circumvent regulations. RTC dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC dismissal based on (1) Tri-Corp's motion for reconsideration being filed out of time, (2) Tri-Corp not being a party in interest due to rescission of the contract, and (3) HLURB's exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Greystone:** Obligation to deliver a condominium unit free from encumbrances and constructed in accordance with regulations. Potential liability for misrepresentation and unsound real estate practices.
*   **Tri-Corp:** Obligation to pay according to the Contract to Sell.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** The central issue is whether the RTC (sitting as a Land Registration Court) or the HLURB has jurisdiction over the dispute.  The conflicting descriptions and allegations of circumvention point towards issues related to registration and unsound real estate practices, potentially falling under HLURB's exclusive jurisdiction under **PD 1344, Section 1**.
*   **Rescission of Contract:** Greystone's rescission of the Contract to Sell and forfeiture of payments raises issues of due process and the validity of the rescission, especially if Greystone is found to be in breach of the contract itself.
*   **Party in Interest:** The CA's finding that Tri-Corp is no longer a party in interest due to rescission is contentious. If the rescission is invalid or unjustified, Tri-Corp retains its interest as a buyer.
*   **Timeliness of Motion for Reconsideration:** The CA's finding on the motion for reconsideration's timeliness is questionable, particularly regarding whether receipt by the mailbox constitutes valid receipt given the representative's travel.
*   **Ambiguity in Project Descriptions:** The alleged discrepancies in project descriptions used by Greystone raise concerns about transparency and potential violations of regulations.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **PD 957 (Subdivision and Condominium Buyer's Protective Decree):** Relevant as it governs the sale and development of condominiums and protects buyers. Tri-Corp argues that the CA overlooked the protective mantle in PD 957.
*   **PD 1344 (Empowering the National Housing Authority to Issue Writ of Execution in the Enforcement of its Decisions under Presidential Decree No. 957):** Grants the HLURB exclusive jurisdiction over certain real estate disputes, including unsound real estate practices and claims by condominium buyers against developers.  The decision hinges on the interpretation of this law.
*   **Rule 65 (Rules of Court):** The basis for the petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion by the Court of Appeals.
*   ***Cathay Pacific Steel Corporation v. Court of Appeals***: Cited for the definition of Grave abuse of discretion.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Rescission Clause in Contract to Sell:** The validity and enforceability of this clause are questionable, especially considering the allegations against Greystone.
*   **Clause on jurisdiction** The contract to sell may contain clauses that define jurisdiction over disputes, which may influence the interpretation of relevant laws such as P.D. 1344.

**Analysis:**

The case hinges on the proper interpretation of HLURB's jurisdiction under PD 1344. While the RTC may have jurisdiction over purely land registration issues, the allegations of unsound real estate practices and circumvention of regulations arguably fall within the HLURB's expertise. The validity of the rescission of the Contract to Sell is also crucial. If the rescission is deemed invalid, Tri-Corp remains a party in interest and may have stronger grounds to challenge Greystone's actions. Counsel should focus on demonstrating that the rescission was improper and that the core issues involve unsound real estate practices requiring HLURB's expertise.
