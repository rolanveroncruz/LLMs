**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Joel and Marietta Marimla vs. People of the Philippines***

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 seeking to annul RTC Orders denying Motion to Quash Search Warrant and Suppress Evidence.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Search Warrant Issuance:** The case concerns the validity of a search warrant issued by the RTC of Manila (Judge Guariña III) for a residence in Angeles City, Pampanga, based on applications filed by the NBI for violation of RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act).
*   **Evidence Seized:** The search resulted in the seizure of marijuana and cash.
*   **Motion to Quash:** Petitioners (Marimla spouses) filed a motion to quash, arguing: (1) lack of territorial jurisdiction; (2) grave abuse of discretion in issuing the warrant; (3) warrant void ab initio; and (4) inadmissible evidence.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The RTC (Judge Viola) denied the motion, relying on A.M. No. 99-10-09-SC, which authorizes Executive Judges of Manila and Quezon City RTCs to issue warrants, executable outside their territorial jurisdiction, in cases involving dangerous drugs, etc., filed by the NBI. The RTC further held that the NBI Deputy Director for Special Investigation can sign the application.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (Marimla Spouses):** Subject to prosecution under RA 6425 based on the seized evidence.
*   **NBI:** Obligated to comply with the requirements of A.M. No. 99-10-09-SC and the Rules of Criminal Procedure when applying for search warrants.
*   **Issuing Judge (Guariña III):** Held to have complied with the procedural and substantive requirements for issuing the search warrant.
*   **RTC (Viola):** Upheld in properly denying the Motion to Quash and Motion for Reconsideration.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Delegation of Authority:** The central argument revolves around whether the Director of the NBI can delegate the endorsement of the search warrant application to the Deputy Director. The court relies on Sec. 31, Chapter 6, Book IV of the Administrative Code of 1987 (E.O. 292) to justify delegation of ministerial duties.
*   **Validity of A.M. No. 99-10-09-SC:** Petitioners argued that the issuance was no longer valid when the revised rules of Criminal Procedure came into effect. The court upheld its continued effectivity based on the Supreme Court issuing A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC stating that it will be an exception to Section 2 of Rule 126 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Hierarchy of Courts:** The Supreme Court acknowledges the violation of the hierarchy of courts by the petitioners in filing directly before them but opts to take cognizance of the petition due to it involving rules promulgated by the Court itself.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act):** Violation of Section 8, Article II, the basis for the criminal charges against the petitioners.
*   **Rule 126, Section 2, Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Deals with the court where application for search warrant shall be filed.
*   **A.M. No. 99-10-09-SC:** Clarifies the guidelines on the application for the enforceability of search warrants, specifically authorizing Executive Judges of Manila and Quezon City RTCs to issue warrants in certain cases.
*   **A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC:** Reiterates the guidelines from A.M. No. 99-10-09-SC and states that they shall be an exception to Section 2 of Rule 126.
*   **Sec. 31, Chapter 6, Book IV of E.O. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987):** Justifies the delegation of duties by the NBI Director to the Deputy Director.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "personally endorsed" in A.M. No. 99-10-09-SC and whether it precludes delegation by the NBI Director. This hinges on whether endorsement is deemed a purely ministerial act.
*   The issue of the continued validity of A.M. No. 99-10-09-SC given the subsequent enactment of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure. The SC held that it was reiterated by the A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC.
*   Petitioners claiming that the questioned Search Warrant was void ab initio.
