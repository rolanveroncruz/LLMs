## Legal Document Summary: *Roma Drug v. RTC Guagua, Pampanga* (G.R. No. 149907)

**Case Summary:** This Supreme Court decision addresses the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 8203 (Special Law on Counterfeit Drugs - SLCD) and its impact on the importation of drugs not sourced from the local authorized distributor. The petitioner, Roma Drug, was raided for selling imported drugs (Augmentin, Orbenin, Amoxil, Ampiclox) not purchased through the Philippine distributor, Glaxo Smithkline. The petitioner was charged with violating Section 4(a) of the SLCD for selling "counterfeit drugs," defined under the SLCD as "unregistered imported drug products." The petitioner challenged the law's constitutionality.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **SLCD Sections 3(b)(3), 4, and 5:** These provisions were challenged for violating the equal protection clause, Section 11, Article XIII (affordable health services), and Section 15, Article II (right to health) of the Constitution. The core issue was whether classifying imported drugs not registered with the local distributor as "counterfeit" and thus illegal was constitutional.
*   **Definition of "Counterfeit Drug" under SLCD:** The case hinges on the SLCD's broad definition, which includes drugs identical in content to locally registered ones but imported without authorization. The drugs were not alleged to be adulterated or mislabeled; the issue was solely their import source.
*   **Impact of RA 9502 ("Universally Accessible Cheaper and Quality Medicines Act of 2008"):** This law significantly altered the landscape. Section 7 of RA 9502 amended Section 72 of the Intellectual Property Code, granting third parties the right to import patented drugs even if registered in the Philippines.
*   **Conflict between SLCD and RA 9502:**  The Court found an irreconcilable conflict. RA 9502's allowance of third-party importation negated the SLCD's classification of such imports as "counterfeit." The principle of *legis posterior derogat priori* (later law repeals prior laws) was applied.
*   **Constitutional Concerns (While Mooted, Addressed):** The Court noted potential constitutional issues with the SLCD, including discrimination against those unable to afford expensive, locally distributed drugs and the restriction of humanitarian efforts involving drug importation. The SLCD potentially criminalizes "constitutionally permissible behavior."

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Previously, under the SLCD,** there was a risk of criminal prosecution for selling or possessing drugs imported without authorization from the Philippine patent/trademark holder.
*   **Post RA 9502:** The Court held that prosecution under the SLCD for importing/selling unregistered imported drugs is no longer warranted due to the conflict with RA 9502.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reliance on RA 9502:** While the Court granted prohibition, there is a risk that the specific factual scenario would not always fall squarely within the protections afforded by the RA. A careful assessment would still be needed to ensure compliance with any remaining applicable laws.
*   **Ambiguity & Contentious Clauses (Pre-RA 9502):**  The definition of "counterfeit" was contentious, particularly its potential for overbroad application and its impact on access to affordable medicine.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8203 (Special Law on Counterfeit Drugs):** Centrally challenged statute.
*   **RA 9502 (Universally Accessible Cheaper and Quality Medicines Act of 2008):** Amendment to the Intellectual Property Code allowing third-party drug importation.
*   **Intellectual Property Code (as amended by RA 9502):** Defines patent rights and limitations.
*   **Constitution, Article II, Section 15 and Article XIII, Section 11:**  Guarantees relating to the right to health and the provision of affordable essential goods and health services.
*   **Ramirez v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 23984:** cited on the principle that when a statute of later date, such as Rep. Act No. 9502, clearly reveals an intention on the part of the legislature to abrogate a prior act on the subject that intention must be given effect.

**Conclusion:**

This decision significantly weakens the SLCD concerning the importation of drugs and clarifies that prosecution based solely on the unauthorized importation of genuinely manufactured drugs is no longer valid due to the enactment of RA 9502. The court issued a writ of prohibition.
