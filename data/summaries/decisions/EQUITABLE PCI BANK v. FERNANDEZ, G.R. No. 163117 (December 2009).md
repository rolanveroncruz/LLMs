## Legal Document Summary: *Equitable PCI Bank, Inc. v. Maria Leticia Fernandez and Alice Sison Vda. de Fernandez*, G.R. No. 163117 (2009)

**Case:** Petition for Review of CA Resolutions dismissing EPCIB's Petition for Certiorari and affirming RTC Order granting a writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin the extrajudicial foreclosure of respondents' properties.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan Agreements:** Respondents secured loans totaling P26,200,000 from EPCIB, evidenced by promissory notes.
*   **Real Estate Mortgages:** Loans secured by real estate mortgages over five parcels of land registered in the name of respondents.
*   **Default and Foreclosure:** Respondents defaulted on loan payments, leading EPCIB to initiate extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings per the Deeds of Real Estate Mortgage and [Act No. 3135 as amended].
*   **Preliminary Injunction:** RTC granted respondents' application for a writ of preliminary injunction, halting the foreclosure, upon a P200,000 bond.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents:** Obligated to repay loans to EPCIB per the promissory notes.  Liable for defaulting on loan obligations, triggering foreclosure rights.
*   **EPCIB:** Right to foreclose on mortgaged properties due to respondents' default. Obligation to comply with procedures for extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **Injunction Bond:** Respondents obligation to provide the P200,000 bond to answer for any damages resulting from wrongful preliminary injunction.

**Ruling and Rationale:**

*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Granted EPCIB's petition, reversed CA Resolutions, and nullified the RTC's writ of preliminary injunction.
*   **Rationale:** The Court found that the RTC acted with grave abuse of discretion. To issue a preliminary injunction, the applicant must demonstrate a clear and unmistakable right, a material and substantial invasion of that right, and an urgent and paramount necessity to prevent serious damage, citing *Tecnogas Philippines Manufacturing Corporation v. Philippine National Bank, G.R. No. 161004, 14 April 2008, 551 SCRA 183*. Respondents admitted their indebtedness and EPCIB therefore had the right to foreclose on properties as security for the defaulted loans.
*   **Interlocutory Order Exception:** The court recognized that while generally, Certiorari is not available to challenge an interlocutory order, exception exists where the order is patently erroneous and an appeal would not afford adequate and expeditious relief, citing *Salcedo-Ortañez v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 110662, 4 August 1994, 235 SCRA 111.*

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Underlying Annulment Case:** While the injunction was lifted, the main case for annulment of the real estate mortgages remains. Respondents might pursue this case, potentially alleging defects in the mortgage agreements.
*   **Potential damages from wrongful injunction:** EPCIB may have a claim on the P200,000 bond. The extent of provable damages caused by the injunction will determine how much EPCIB can recover.
