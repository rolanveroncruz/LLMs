## Legal Document Summary: People v. Pagsigan, G.R. No. 232487

**Nature:** Appeal assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Emma T. Pagsigan for violation of Sections 5 (sale) and 11 (possession) of Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Accusation:** Pagsigan was charged with selling 0.0221 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) to a poseur-buyer and possessing 0.0206 grams of shabu.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** A buy-bust operation led to Pagsigan's arrest. The prosecution presented evidence of marked money used in the sale and the recovery of shabu from Pagsigan.
*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** The main point of contention is the non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 regarding the custody and disposition of seized drugs. Specifically, the defense argued that the prosecution failed to properly establish the *corpus delicti* due to:
    *   **Lack of Inventory and Photographs:** No inventory or photographs of the seized items were taken immediately after seizure in the presence of the accused, elected public official, and representatives from the National Prosecution Service or the media.
    *   **Absence of Insulating Witnesses:** No DOJ or media representatives were present during the marking of the evidence.
*   **Section 21, R.A. 9165:** The appeal centers around the interpretation and application of Section 21 of R.A. 9165, as amended by R.A. No. 10640. The Court notes that non-compliance with Section 21 can lead to the acquittal of the accused.
*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution argued that the buy-bust operation had to be conducted quickly, preventing full compliance with Section 21. The police claimed a lack of resources and time to prepare an inventory, take photographs, and secure the presence of insulating witnesses.
* **Mallillin v. People**: The decision cites this case, noting that small amounts of evidence similar to common substances are especially prone to tampering.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Law Enforcement Obligations:** The apprehending team has a legal obligation under Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 to strictly adhere to the requirements for the handling and documentation of seized drugs.
*   **Prosecution Burden:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt all elements of the crime, including the integrity of the *corpus delicti*. Failure to do so warrants acquittal.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Justifiable Grounds:** The Court found the police officers' explanations for non-compliance were insufficient, especially given their experience and knowledge of R.A. No. 9165.
*   **Integrity of Evidence:** The Court ruled that the prosecution failed to show that the seized substance was the same substance presented in court.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the appeal and **REVERSED** the lower courts' decisions.
*   Accused-appellant Emma T. Pagsigan was **ACQUITTED** based on reasonable doubt.

**Legal Precision:**

*   The decision reinforces the importance of strict compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 in drug cases.
*   It emphasizes that the prosecution must provide justifiable reasons for non-compliance and must prove that the integrity of the evidence was preserved despite any procedural lapses.
*   The decision highlights that the court cannot presume the existence of justifiable grounds for non-compliance, these must be proven as facts.
