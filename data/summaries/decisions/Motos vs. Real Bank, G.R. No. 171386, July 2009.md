Here's a concise legal summary of the document, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Gloria R. Motos and Martin Motos vs. Real Bank (A Thrift Bank), Inc.* G.R. No. 171386, July 17, 2009.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 85064, which affirmed in part the RTC's grant of a writ of possession in favor of Real Bank following extrajudicial foreclosure.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Motos (Petitioners) obtained loans from Real Bank (Respondent), secured by a real estate mortgage.
*   Upon default, Real Bank extrajudicially foreclosed under Act No. 3135, as amended.
*   Real Bank was the highest bidder and obtained a Certificate of Sale. After the redemption period, they consolidated title and obtained TCT No. N-220068.
*   Real Bank filed an *ex parte* Petition for Writ of Possession (LRC No. Q15302 (02)), granted by the RTC.
*   Spouses Motos moved to quash the writ, arguing lack of notice, but the RTC denied the motion.  Their appeal was initially denied due course.
*   The Court of Appeals upheld the writ's issuance (ministerial duty), but directed the RTC to give due course to the Motos' appeal of the denial of their motion to quash.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure):** Governs the entire process, including right to foreclosure, sale, redemption period, and obtaining a writ of possession.
*   **Section 7, Act No. 3135:** Allows the purchaser (Real Bank) to petition for a writ of possession.  The court's duty is generally ministerial if the motion is proper, a bond is approved, and no third party is involved. The writ of possession must be approved during the redemption period by filing a bond. After the expiration of the redemption period, the bond is no longer necessary.
*   **Section 8, Act No. 3135:** Provides the debtor (Motos) with a remedy: to petition to set aside the sale and cancel the writ of possession within 30 days of the purchaser being given possession, alleging mortgage violation or non-compliance with the Act.
*   **Section 14, Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act):** Provides the mortgagor the right to appeal the denial of a petition to set aside the sale and writ of possession. However, the order of possession shall continue in effect during the pendency of the appeal.
*   **Spouses Motos' Obligation:** To repay the loan. Their failure triggered the right to foreclose.
*   **Real Bank's Obligation:** To comply with the procedures outlined in Act No. 3135, as amended, for valid extrajudicial foreclosure and obtaining a writ of possession.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Spouses Motos:** Loss of property due to foreclosure. Potential liability for deficiencies if the sale price didn't cover the loan amount. Risk of eviction.
*   **Real Bank:** Risk of successful challenge to the validity of the foreclosure sale if procedures under Act No. 3135 weren't strictly followed, potentially resulting in reversal of the writ of possession.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118:** Primary statutory basis for extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act):** Pertains to appeals of land registration cases.
*   **Doctrine of Ministerial Duty:** Courts have a ministerial duty to issue a writ of possession in foreclosure cases when requirements are met (motion, bond (if during redemption period), no 3rd party). *China Banking Corporation v. Lozada, G.R. No. 164919, July 4, 2008*
*   **Ex Parte Nature:**  Petition for writ of possession under Section 7 of Act No. 3135 is *ex parte*, requiring no notice to the debtor.  *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Bance, G.R. No. 167280, April 30, 2008.*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Propriety of Motion to Quash:** The proper remedy for the Motos was a petition to set aside the sale and writ of possession under Section 8 of Act No. 3135, *not* a motion to quash.
*   **Appealability of Denial of Motion to Quash:** The Supreme Court found that the denial of the motion to quash was an interlocutory order and thus not appealable under the Rules of Court.  The CA erred in directing the RTC to give due course to the Motos' appeal.
*   **Effect of Appeal on Writ of Possession:** Even if the Motos had properly appealed the grant of the writ, Section 8 explicitly states that "the order of possession shall continue in effect during the pendency of the appeal."

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately *denied* the Motos' petition. It affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision upholding the writ of possession but *modified* it by reinstating the RTC's orders denying due course to the Motos' appeal. The writ of possession in favor of Real Bank is enforceable. The Motos' procedural errors in failing to properly petition to set aside the sale and writ of possession, and their attempt to appeal an interlocutory order, were fatal to their case. Real Bank appears to have followed proper procedure under Act 3135, as amended.
