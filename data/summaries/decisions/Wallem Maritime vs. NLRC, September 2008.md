## Legal Document Summary - *Wallem Maritime Services, Inc. v. NLRC and Tiburcio D. dela Cruz* (G.R. No. 163838)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA Decision affirming with modification the NLRC's decision regarding disability benefits claim of a seafarer.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Wallem Maritime Services, Inc. (WMSI) and Wallem Shipmanagement Hongkong Limited (WSHL)
*   **Respondent:** Tiburcio D. dela Cruz (Seafarer/Claimant)
*   **Respondents(Public):** National Labor Relations Commission

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **POEA-SEC Incorporation:** The employment contract explicitly incorporates the POEA-SEC, specifically Section 20-B concerning compensation and benefits for injury or illness. This section outlines employer liabilities.
*   **Medical Examination & Assessment:** Requires the seafarer to undergo a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three working days of repatriation, absent physical incapacity. Failure to comply forfeits claim rights.
*   **Sickness Allowance:** Seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage until declared fit or the degree of permanent disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician, but in no case shall this period exceed one hundred twenty (120) days.
*   **Disability Benefits:** Based on medical assessments within a specific timeline and the seafarer's ability to perform his customary work.

**Liabilities:**

*   The main point of contention is whether the seafarer, Tiburcio D. dela Cruz, is entitled to permanent disability benefits due to a back injury sustained during his employment. The NLRC awarded US$25,000.00 in disability benefits plus attorney's fees, which the CA affirmed, removing the attorney's fees.
*   The core liability revolves around the interpretation of Section 20-B(3) of the POEA-SEC and the impact of the initial "unfit to work" declaration by the company-designated physician in Fujairah compared to the subsequent "fit to work" assessment by the company-designated physician in the Philippines (Dr. Lim).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of 120-day Period:**  The central issue is the interpretation of the 120-day period in Section 20-B(3). The Petitioners argue that it only limits the period for sickness allowance, not the time frame for the company-designated physician to determine fitness. The Supreme Court however ruled that the true test of whether respondent suffered from a permanent disability is whether there is evidence that he was unable to perform his customary work as messman for more than 120 days.
*   **Conflict of Medical Opinions:**  The case highlights the potential for conflicting medical opinions between company-designated physicians (Fujairah and Philippines) and the OWWA's Impediment Grade assessment.  The Supreme Court emphasizes that while the initial assessment in Fujairah is not determinative, both reports are subject to scrutiny based on their inherent merit, but what is important to consider is if seafarer was able to perform his work for more than 120 days from his repatriation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **POEA-SEC (Department Order No. 33 and Memorandum Circular No. 55, series of 1996):**  The foundation of the employment contract and the source of the obligations and liabilities. Section 20-B(3) is the primary focus.
*   **Labor Code (PD No. 626):**  Referenced for definitions of temporary total disability, permanent total disability, and permanent partial disability, used to interpret Section 20-B(3).
*   ***Remigio v. National Labor Relations Commission*** **(G.R. No. 159887):**  Cited to support the application of the Labor Code's definition of permanent disability to seafarer cases.
*   ***Crystal Shipping, Inc. v. Natividad*** **(G.R. No. 154798):** Permanent disability means the inability of a worker to perform his job for more than 120 days.
*   ***Philmare, Inc. v. Suganob*** **(G.R. No. 168753):** Court held that the latter suffered from permanent disability in view of evidence that he had been unable to work as chief cook for more than 7 months.
*   ***Micronesia Resources v. Cantomayor*** **(G.R. No. 156573):** Court declared the seafarers therein to have suffered from a permanent disability after taking evidence into account that they had remained under treatment for more than 120 days, and were unable to work for the same period.
*   ***United Philippine Lines, Inc. and/or Holland America Line, Inc. v. Beseril*** **(G.R. No. 165934):** Court declared the seafarers therein to have suffered from a permanent disability after taking evidence into account that they had remained under treatment for more than 120 days, and were unable to work for the same period.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Section 20-B(3) of the POEA-SEC:** The timing of the fitness assessment by the company-designated physician in relation to the 120-day period and its impact on the seafarer's claim for disability benefits is highly contentious.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court ultimately denied the petition and affirmed the CA decision, ruling that the seafarer, Tiburcio D. dela Cruz, was indeed entitled to permanent disability benefits because he was unable to perform his customary work for more than 120 days.
