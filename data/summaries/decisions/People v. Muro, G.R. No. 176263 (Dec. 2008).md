# Case Summary: *People v. Muro*, G.R. No. 176263 (2008)

**Subject:** Appeal from conviction for rape in relation to Republic Act 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act)

**Facts:** Michael Muro was charged with raping AAA, a 13-year-old deaf-mute girl. AAA testified that Muro forced her to a vacant lot and raped her. Medical examination revealed she was non-virgin with healed lacerations but no fresh injuries, and negative for spermatozoa. Muro claimed alibi.

**RTC Ruling:** Found Muro guilty and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*.

**CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC decision.

**SC Ruling:** Reversed CA and RTC, acquitted Muro due to reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Rape Definition & Elements:** Prosecution relied on AAA's testimony, considering her condition as a deaf-mute.
*   **Uncorroborated Testimony:** The Supreme Court reiterated the rule that in rape cases, the uncorroborated testimony of the victim must be clear, impeccable, and bear the stamp of absolute candor.
*   **Material Inconsistencies:** Discrepancies in AAA's testimony (between affidavit and court testimony, and concerning prior sexual experiences) raised doubts about her credibility.
*   **Lack of Corroboration:** Muro's alibi was challenged for lack of supporting witnesses.
*   **Physical Evidence:** Lack of fresh injuries on the victim despite the alleged forceful rape in a "watery area" was significant.
*   **Conduct of Accused:** Muro's act of fetching the victim's mother and bringing her to the barangay hall cast doubt on his culpability.
*   **Reasonable Doubt:** The cumulative effect of the inconsistencies, lack of corroboration, and questionable circumstances led the SC to conclude that the prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act) - invoked as the law violated alongside rape.

**Case Law:**

*   *People v. Mateo* - Cited for the intermediate review procedure in cases with severe penalties.
*   *People v. Mi√±ano* - Cited for the requirement that the uncorroborated testimony of the victim in a rape case be clear, impeccable, and bear the stamp of absolute candor.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Reliance on a deaf-mute witness's testimony is inherently challenging, requiring careful scrutiny of the interpreter's accuracy and the witness's understanding.
*   The medical evidence's ambiguity (healed vs. fresh lacerations) could be subject to varying interpretations.
*   The alibi defense, while weak in general, was strengthened by the discrepancies in the prosecution's evidence.
*   The court's emphasis on the victim's behavior after the alleged rape (not immediately going home, not crying) could be criticized as outdated and insensitive to trauma responses.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Interpretation of the doctor's findings regarding the healed lacerations.
*   The credibility of the complainant based on inconsistent statements in the affidavit.

**Overall:**

This case demonstrates the Supreme Court's cautious approach to rape convictions, especially when relying solely on the victim's testimony. The decision highlights the importance of corroborating evidence and the need for clear and consistent statements from witnesses, particularly in cases involving vulnerable individuals. The decision reveals a lack of diligence by the prosecution.
