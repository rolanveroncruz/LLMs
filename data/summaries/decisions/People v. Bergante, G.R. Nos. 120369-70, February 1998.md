## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Bergante*, G.R. Nos. 120369-70

**Case Overview:** This Supreme Court decision affirms the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Rex, Rodito, and Leo Bergante for murder based on eyewitness testimony and the victim's dying declaration. The Court also initially convicted Rex Bergante of illegal possession of firearms but subsequently acquitted him due to retroactive application of R.A. 8294.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Murder Conviction (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code):** The court found the Bergantes guilty of murder due to a coordinated attack on the victim. Rex shot the victim, Rodito struck him with a mangrove branch, and Leo pierced his eye with a bolo.
*   **Dying Declaration (Rule 130, Sec. 37, Rules of Court):** The victim's statements identifying the attackers and describing the attack were admitted as a dying declaration, fulfilling the requirements: (1) related to the cause and circumstances of death, (2) made under consciousness of impending death, (3) declarant was competent, and (4) offered in a homicide/murder case.  The court also mentioned res gestae as an alternative basis for admissibility (Rule 130, Sec. 42, Rules of Court).
*   **Conspiracy:** The court found the brothers acted in conspiracy, evidenced by their coordinated actions and unity of purpose. This leads to the principle that the act of one is the act of all (People v. Pama, 216 SCRA 385).
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The court identified generic aggravating circumstances of (1) disrespect due to the victim's age and (2) cruelty in inflicting unnecessary suffering. The "use of an unlicensed firearm" was also considered an aggravating circumstance specifically for Rex under R.A. 8294.
*   **Damages:** The Court modified the damages awarded, increasing actual damages to P82,000 based on evidence of expenses. They specifically awarded P50,000 as civil indemnity, P25,000 to the widow as moral damages, and P25,000 as exemplary damages.
*   **Illegal Possession of Firearms (P.D. No. 1866, as amended by R.A. 8294):** While initially convicted, Rex was acquitted due to R.A. 8294's amendment stating that using an unlicensed firearm in homicide/murder is merely an aggravating circumstance, not a separate crime. This was applied retroactively.

**Liabilities:**

*   Rex, Rodito, and Leo Bergante are jointly and severally liable for P50,000 as civil indemnity, P25,000 as exemplary damages, and P25,000 to the widow as moral damages.
*   The Bergantes had no basis for alibi.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Factual Disputes:**  The defense argued issues with the eyewitness credibility and the possibility of another shooter. The Court rejected these arguments based on the consistency and credibility of the prosecution witnesses and the victim's identification.
*   **Retroactive Application of Law:** The Court favorably applied R.A. 8294 retroactively to Rex, but future cases may present different scenarios where retroactive application is not beneficial or permissible (Art. 22, Revised Penal Code).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Establishing the *quantum* of evidence for conspiracy requires careful analysis of the accused's actions and intent.
