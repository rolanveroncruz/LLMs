**Case Summary: *Spouses Amado and Lolita Pecson vs. Sheriff Vicente Sicat, Jr., et al.* (A.M. No. P-98-1280, October 16, 1998)**

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative complaint filed by Spouses Pecson against Sheriff Liwanag, Sheriff Sicat, and Process Server Dacia for grave abuse of authority and grave misconduct related to the implementation of a writ of execution in Civil Case No. 7239 (*First Express Credit Corporation v. Amado Pecson, et al.*).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Writ of Execution:** Issued against Spouses Pecson for failure to comply with a judgment by compromise.
*   **Irregular Implementation:** Complainants alleged:
    *   Sheriff Sicat and Process Server Dacia were not deputized.
    *   Lack of coordination with barangay officials or family members.
    *   Confiscation of vehicle without proper inventory or public auction.
    *   Theft of P96,000.00 from the vehicle.
*   **Sheriff Liwanag's Defense:** Complied with the law, acted in the presence of a police officer and witnesses, and inventoried the contents (later contradicted).
*   **Sheriff Sicat's Defense:** Merely assisted Sheriff Liwanag as per customary practice.
*   **Process Server Dacia's Defense:** Only provided a ride and performed minor tasks, not involved in the execution.

**Findings & Liabilities:**

*   **Sheriff Liwanag:** Found liable for gross inefficiency and incompetence, and grave abuse of authority.  Specifically:
    *   Failure to make a detailed inventory (violating Rule 57, Section 6 of the Rules of Court). *See Evangelista v. Penserga, 242 SCRA 702 (1995); Florendo v. Enrile, 239 SCRA 22 (1994)* (ministerial duty of sheriffs).
    *   Unauthorized delivery of the seized vehicle to the plaintiff's representative. *See Jumio v. Egay-Eviota, 231 SCRA 551 (1994); Eduarte v. Ramos, 238 SCRA 36 (1994)* (Sheriff must strictly follow the mandate of the writ).
    *   Suspended for one month without pay.
*   **Sheriff Sicat:** Found liable for neglect of duty and incompetence. Failure to advise Liwanag on proper inventory procedures. Fined P1,000.00.
*   **Process Server Dacia:** Admonished for interfering in the implementation of the writ despite his position. *See Flores v. Caniya, 256 SCRA 518 (1996)* (Court employees must act with propriety).
*   **Claim of Theft (P96,000):** Not given credence due to lack of evidence and implausibility.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Deputization of Assistants:** The lack of formal deputization for Sheriff Sicat and Process Server Dacia raises questions about the validity of their actions during the execution of the writ. While Sheriff Sicat claimed it was common practice, it highlights a procedural lapse.
*   **Inventory Discrepancy:** Sheriff Liwanag's initial claim of inventory versus his later admission in the TSN presents a credibility issue and exposes him to potential criminal charges related to falsification and dereliction of duty if the complainants pursue those avenues.
*   **Liability for Damages:** While the administrative case primarily dealt with the conduct of the court personnel, the Spouses Pecson could potentially pursue civil action for damages arising from the alleged improper implementation of the writ and any resulting losses.
*   **"Customary Practice" Defense:** The reliance on "customary practice" by Sheriff Sicat to justify his involvement is a weak defense and can be challenged by highlighting the specific rules and regulations governing sheriffs' duties.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 57, Section 6, Rules of Court:** Requirement for Sheriff's return with a full statement of proceedings and a complete inventory.
*   **Evangelista v. Penserga, 242 SCRA 702 (1995); Florendo v. Enrile, 239 SCRA 22 (1994):**  Sheriff's duty is ministerial.
*   **Jumio v. Egay-Eviota, 231 SCRA 551 (1994); Eduarte v. Ramos, 238 SCRA 36 (1994):** Sheriff must strictly follow the mandate of the writ.
*    **Flores v. Caniya, 256 SCRA 518 (1996):** Court employees must act with propriety.

**Recommendations:**

*   Review the writ of execution and supporting documentation to verify its validity and scope.
*   Investigate any departmental policies regarding deputization of assistants in writ executions.
*   Assess potential civil liability risks.
*   Counsel the clients on their right to pursue further legal actions, including civil lawsuits.
