## Legal Document Summary: *Tagaro v. Garcia* (G.R. No. 173931, April 02, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' decision reversing Civil Service Commission (CSC) resolutions that declared the petitioner's removal from Director III position at the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) illegal.

**Key Issue:** Whether the petitioner, Alicia Tagaro, was illegally removed from her reclassified Director III position, and whether she is entitled to back salaries. Central to this is the question of whether a new appointment was required after the reclassification/upgrading of her position.

**Background Facts:**

*   Petitioner was appointed Director II at CHED.
*   CHED requested and obtained DBM approval to reclassify the Director II position to Director III. A NOSCA was issued, effective May 1, 1999.
*   The CHED requested certain documents from Tagaro to reclassify the position, but she did not comply.
*   CHED (Chair Garcia) subsequently attempted to roll back her salary to Director II, arguing a new appointment was required, citing the Office of the President's opinion based on CSC Memorandum Circular No. 40, series of 1998 (CSC MC No. 40, s.1998).
*   CHED later abolished the Director II position.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **CHED's Position:** New appointment was indispensable per CSC MC No. 40, s.1998, as interpreted by the Office of the President. Since Tagaro failed to fulfill requirements for new appointment, her salary was rolled back, and a new officer-in-charge was appointed. Later argued the position was abolished and removal was valid.
*   **Petitioner's Position:** No new appointment was needed per Section 28, Book V, Title I, Subtitle A, Chapter 5 of the Civil Service Law, as the position upgrade did not involve changes in qualification requirements.  She argued she was effectively automatically appointed to the upgraded position per the terms of Sec 4(k) of CSC MC No. 40, s. 1998
*   **CSC's Initial Rulings:** Initially ruled the CHED's actions illegal and ordered reinstatement and back salaries.  Later modified to only award back salaries due to Tagaro's retirement.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7722:** Act creating the CHED. Section 11 is referenced regarding appointment authority.
*   **Section 28, Book V, Title I, Subtitle A, Chapter 5 of the Civil Service Law (Revised Administrative Code of 1987):**  Petitioner's main argument against the need for a new appointment, stating that salary adjustments due to position upgrades not involving changes in qualification requirements do not require new appointments.
*   **CSC Memorandum Circular No. 40, series (s.) of 1998 (CSC MC No. 40, s.1998):** CHED's reliance on Section 4(k) of this circular, arguing that new appointments are required for reclassified/upgraded positions, as well as Tagaro's interpretation of the same section providing for automatic reclassification in her case.
*   ***Tagaro v. Garcia*, G.R. No. 158568:** Previous case involving the same parties and issues where the Court found the petitioner guilty of forum shopping.
*   **Relevant Forum Shopping Case Law:** Cites *Municipality of Taguig v. Court of Appeals* and others defining forum shopping and its consequences.
*   ***De Jesus v. Commission on Audit*, 451 Phil. 812 (2003):** Applied to argue against the refund, citing good faith acceptance of benefits.
*   ***Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary*, G.R. No. 83896, 22 February 1991, 194 SCRA 317 and *Blaquera v. Hon. Alcala*, 356 Phil. 678 (1998):** Applied to argue that the petitioner, in good faith discharged the duties pertaining to her office and is therefore legally entitled to the compensation attached to the office for the services she actually rendered.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Section 4(k), Rule III of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 40, series (s.) of 1998:**  Interpretation of the different paragraphs within this section is contested. The CHED focuses on the general requirement of new appointments. The petitioner focuses on the paragraph mandating automatic appointment of incumbents.
*   **"Changes in qualification requirements" (Section 28 of the Civil Service Law):**  Whether the reclassification from Director II to Director III involved such changes is a central factual and legal question.

**Potential Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Forum Shopping:** The Court already found petitioner guilty of forum shopping in a previous case involving similar issues.
*   **Salary Refund:** If the CHED prevails on the need for a new appointment, Tagaro could be liable for refunding the salary differential received.

**Outcome:**

*   The Court DENIED the petition due to the existence of forum shopping.
*   However, the Court also ruled that Tagaro is entitled to keep the salary differential she had received during her tenure as Director III at the CHED-HEDF.
