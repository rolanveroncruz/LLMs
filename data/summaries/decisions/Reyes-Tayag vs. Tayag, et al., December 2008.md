**Legal Document Summary: *Anna Liza Reyes-Tayag vs. Abelardo Tayag and Nerisa V. Nacion***

**Case:** A.M. OCA No. CA-02-16-P (Formerly OCA IPI No. 00-27-CA-P)

**Court:** Supreme Court, Second Division

**Date:** December 18, 2008

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Anna Liza Reyes-Tayag (Legal wife of Respondent Tayag)
*   **Respondents:**
    *   Abelardo F. Tayag (Former Clerk III, Court of Appeals)
    *   Nerisa V. Nacion (Clerk III, Records Officer I, Court of Appeals)

**Nature of Complaint:** Immorality (Adultery/Illicit Relationship)

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Allegations:** Complainant alleged Respondent Tayag was having an affair with Respondent Nacion, resulting in the birth of a child (Alexis Francesca).  Complainant later alleged a second child was born.
*   **Dual Complaints:** Complainant filed the same complaint in both the Court of Appeals (CA) and the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA). She withdrew from CA case to avoid forum shopping.
*   **CA Proceedings:** Despite withdrawal, the CA proceeded and found Nacion guilty of immorality, initially suspending her for three months, later reduced to a fine of P10,000.
*   **OCA Investigation:** OCA investigated based on the original allegations and a later allegation of a second child fathered by Tayag with Nacion.
*   **Investigating Justice Report:** CA Justice Bato found insufficient evidence to support the second child allegation and that the respondents were living together or still in an illicit relationship. Complainant failed to appear at hearings to present evidence.
*   **Tayag's Employment:** Tayag was dropped from the CA rolls due to absences without approved leave, rendering the case against him moot according to the OCA, although the Supreme Court dismissed the case based on lack of jurisdiction.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Public Officials' Conduct:**  The case concerns the standard of conduct required of public officials. Rule IV, Section 52, A(15) of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service classifies disgraceful and immoral conduct as a grave offense.
*   **Standard of Proof:** The court requires "competent and reliable evidence" to prove immoral conduct, derived from direct knowledge, not mere allegations or suppositions. *Mikrostar Industrial Corporation v. Mabalot, A.M. No. P-05-2097, December 15, 2005, 478 SCRA 6* is cited regarding the standard of evidence required.
*   **Non-Forum Shopping:** Complainant initially attempted to withdraw the CA case to avoid forum shopping, but the CA continued the case regardless.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Forum Shopping/Res Judicata Concerns:**  The simultaneous filing in the CA and OCA, despite attempted withdrawal from the CA, presents a forum shopping issue.  The CA's final ruling on the initial complaint could potentially bar re-litigation of the same issues under the principle of res judicata or double jeopardy.
*   **Evidentiary Standard:** The core issue is the standard of proof for immorality in administrative cases. Relying on the CA's prior findings without presenting new evidence in the OCA investigation proved fatal.
*   **Paternity Determination:** The paternity of the second child was not conclusively established, which undermined the complainant's case.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (MC No. 19, s. 1999, Civil Service Commission), Rule IV, Section 52, A(15) (Grave Offense of disgraceful and immoral conduct)

**Case Law:**

*   *Mikrostar Industrial Corporation v. Mabalot, A.M. No. P-05-2097, December 15, 2005, 478 SCRA 6* (Regarding the standard of evidence required in administrative cases).

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court *DISMISSED* the administrative complaint against Nerisa V. Nacion for lack of evidence. The case against Abelardo Tayag was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction as he was no longer employed by the CA.
