**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Rico de Asis y Balquin*, G.R. No. 225219, June 11, 2018 (833 Phil. 110)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which upheld with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) judgment finding Rico de Asis y Balquin guilty of violating Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of Article II of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002). The accused was acquitted of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia (Section 12, Article II, RA 9165).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, RA 9165):**  Conviction affirmed.  The elements of illegal sale were met: identity of buyer (Agent Gacus) and seller (De Asis), object (shabu), and consideration (P500.00).
*   **Section 11 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, RA 9165):** Conviction affirmed. Four sachets of shabu were found in the accused's possession during the buy-bust operation, without legal authority.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused is obligated to serve the sentences imposed: life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 for illegal sale, and an indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years and one (1) day (minimum) to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months (maximum) and a fine of P300,000.00 for illegal possession.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability under RA 9165 for illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The defense argued a potential break in the chain of custody. However, the Court found that the prosecution successfully established an unbroken chain, citing immediate marking, inventory, photography at the scene in the presence of required witnesses (barangay kagawad, media representative), proper handling and submission to the crime lab, and positive identification of the evidence in court by the officers involved and the forensic chemist. The Court specifically referenced Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640, and related jurisprudence.
*   **Entrapment vs. Instigation:**  While not explicitly raised, defense counsel might have explored whether the buy-bust operation constituted entrapment or illegal instigation.  The positive identification of the accused and the established transaction indicate a predisposition to commit the crime.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sections 5 and 11:** Defines the crimes of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, respectively, and prescribes the corresponding penalties.
*   **RA 10640:** Amendment to Section 21 of RA 9165, impacting chain of custody requirements.
*   **People v. Flor, G.R. No. 216017, January 19, 2018:** Cited regarding the elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **People v. Pundugar, G.R. No. 214779, February 7, 2018:** Cited regarding the elements of illegal possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **People v. Ejan, G.R. No. 212169, December 13, 2017:** Cited regarding chain of custody requirements.
*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 as amended by RA 10640**: Guidelines for handling and custody of seized drugs.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The case hinges on the factual determination of the chain of custody.  While the court found compliance, minor inconsistencies in testimony or documentation could have been exploited to challenge the integrity of the evidence. The "Provided, finally" clause of Section 21 allowing noncompliance "under justifiable grounds" introduces some ambiguity, but the court held it inapplicable here.

**Overall Assessment:**  The prosecution successfully proved the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs. The chain of custody was properly established, and the penalties imposed were in accordance with the law. The defense's arguments were insufficient to overcome the evidence presented by the prosecution.
