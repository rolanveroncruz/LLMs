**Court:** Supreme Court, Second Division

**Date:** April 16, 2018

**Subject Matter:** Administrative matter regarding the dropping from the rolls of Mr. Arno D. Del Rosario, Court Stenographer II, due to absences without official leave (AWOL).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Dropping from the Rolls:** The Court ordered Del Rosario dropped from the rolls, effective February 3, 2017, due to continuous AWOL since that date. The position is declared vacant.

*   **Basis for Decision:** Section 107, Rule 20 of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RACCS) and Section 63, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave, as amended by Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 13, Series of 2007 (reiterates the 30-day AWOL rule).

*   **Employee Rights:** Del Rosario retains entitlement to benefits accrued under existing laws and remains eligible for re-employment in the government. This is a non-disciplinary action.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Del Rosario's Obligation:** To adhere to duty as a public servant to serve with the utmost degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency. Duty to adhere to standards of public accountability.

*   **Court's Liability:** Limited, as this is a non-disciplinary action. The Court is obliged to notify Del Rosario of his separation at his last known address and ensure he receives benefits to which he is entitled.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Calculation of Benefits:** Disputes may arise regarding the specific calculation and disbursement of Del Rosario's accrued benefits (potential for future litigation).

*   **Re-employment:** While eligible, re-employment is not guaranteed, and Del Rosario may face difficulty finding a new position given this record (potential for grievance if re-employment is denied, but less actionable).
