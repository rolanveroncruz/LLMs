**Case Summary: Republic of the Philippines v. Rovency Realty and Development Corporation (G.R. No. 190817)**

**Legal Issue:** Propriety of granting an application for original registration of title to land to a corporation.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and denied Rovency Realty and Development Corporation's (RRDC) application for original registration of Lot No. 3009.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Sections 14(1) and 14(2) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** The application hinged on establishing compliance with either of these provisions.
    *   **14(1):** Open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.
    *   **14(2):** Acquisition of ownership of private lands by prescription under existing laws (Civil Code).

*   **Alienable and Disposable Land Status:** Applicant bears the burden to prove the land's status as alienable and disposable at the time of application. **T.A.N. Properties (578 Phil. 441, 2008) and subsequent cases** require both a CENRO/PENRO certification and a certified true copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary.

*   **Possession Requirements:**
    *   **Open:** Patent, visible, apparent, notorious, not clandestine.
    *   **Continuous:** Uninterrupted, unbroken, not intermittent.
    *   **Exclusive:** Showing exclusive dominion, appropriation to own use and benefit.
    *   **Notorious:** Conspicuous, generally known and talked about.
    *   *Mere claims are not sufficient, proof of specific acts of ownership required.*

*   **Acquisitive Prescription (Section 14(2)):** Requires an express government manifestation that the property is no longer retained for public service/national wealth development (patrimonial property under Article 422 of the Civil Code). Declaration of alienability alone is insufficient.

*   **Constitutional Limitations (Section 3, Article XII, 1987 Constitution):** While this section primarily applies to public domain lands, it becomes relevant if the applicant fails to prove that the land had already become private before its acquisition (by the corporation).

*   **Corporation Code Implications:** The capacity of a corporation to acquire land is contingent upon demonstrating land had become private at the time of acquisition, due to Section 3 Article XII, 1987 Constitution.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to Prove Alienability:**  The applicant's failure to provide a certified true copy of the original classification by the DENR Secretary, despite providing a CENRO certification, is fatal to the application.
*   **Insufficient Evidence of Possession:** The applicant failed to prove continuous and notorious possession and occupation since June 12, 1945, through concrete evidence of dominion by its predecessors-in-interest. Tax declarations post-1945 are insufficient to establish possession since 1945 or earlier.
*   **No Conversion to Patrimonial Property:** The applicant's failure to show that the land was expressly declared as no longer intended for public use/development of national wealth means acquisitive prescription could not have begun to run.
*   **Constitutional Restrictions on Corporate Land Ownership:** As the applicant failed to establish ownership since June 12, 1945 and failed to establish that the land had become private before its acquisition by the corporation, then the application for land registration could not stand.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 1529, Section 14(1) and (2)**
*   **Civil Code, Articles 420(2), 422, and 1113**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The original application did not explicitly state whether it was filed under Section 14(1) or 14(2), making it necessary for the Supreme Court to evaluate the application under both provisions.
*   The determination of when, and if, the land became private property is at issue.

**Conclusion:** The court found the evidence was insufficient to meet the requirements for original registration of land under either Section 14(1) or Section 14(2) of P.D. No. 1529.
