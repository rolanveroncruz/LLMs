## Legal Document Summary: *Soriano v. Marcelo*, G.R. No. 163017 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, challenging the Ombudsman's dismissal of criminal and administrative complaint against 2nd Assistant City Prosecutor Dimagiba for alleged violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Complaint:** Petitioner Soriano alleged Dimagiba showed manifest partiality by recommending reopening the preliminary investigation in a falsification case against Mely Palad after initially recommending filing of the Information against Palad.
*   **Ombudsman's Resolution:** The Ombudsman dismissed the complaint, finding no manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence on Dimagiba's part. Basis for reopening:  Palad's motion to re-open; absence of proof of Palad's receipt of subpoena during the original preliminary investigation. It was found that Dimagiba believed that reopening the investigation would expedite the case, preventing future motions for reinvestigation.
*   **Ombudsman's Rationale:** Relied on the principle of regularity in the performance of official functions and the Marcelo vs. Sandiganbayan definition of manifest partiality requiring clear inclination to favor one side. No evidence presented to prove bad faith, self-interest, or ill will on Dimagiba's part.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Alleged grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the complaint.

**Obligations:**

*   Ombudsman: Duty to investigate and prosecute acts of public officers that appear illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner: Failed to prove the elements of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Manifest Partiality":** The application of the "manifest partiality" standard is inherently subjective and fact-dependent. Whether Dimagiba's actions *actually* constituted favoring Palad, despite her stated intentions, could be debatable.
*   **Circumstances of Reopening:** While the lack of a return receipt for the subpoena provides some basis for reopening, the timing and initial recommendation to file the Information might raise questions about the consistency and prudence of Dimagiba's actions. The fact that a motion for re-open was filed by Palad could be a potential issue to delve into further (date, timing of the motion, and whether it would be standard practice to re-open).
*   **Motion out of Time:** Petitioner filed his Motion for Reconsideration out of time.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019, Sec. 3(e):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. This is the central statutory reference.
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Basis for the Petition for Certiorari, focusing on errors of jurisdiction, not judgment.
*   **Marcelo vs. Sandiganbayan (185 SCRA 346):** Defines "manifest partiality."
*   **Presidential Ad-Hoc Fact Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desierto (G.R. No. 138142, 2007):** Affirms the independence and broad discretion of the Ombudsman.
*   **Presidential Commission on Good Government v. Desierto (G.R. No. 139296, 2007):** Underscores the Ombudsman's discretion in determining probable cause and the limited scope of judicial review.
*   **Collantes v. Marcelo (G.R. Nos. 167006-07, 2007):** Enumerates the elements of Section 3(e) violation and reiterates the presumption of good faith for public officers.
*   **First Corporation v. Former Sixth Division of the Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 171989, 2007):** Distinction between errors of jurisdiction and errors of judgment in Certiorari proceedings.
*   **Sections 12 and 13, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution and RA 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989)** The Ombudsman's power to investigate and prosecute any act or omission of a public officer or employee when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Ombudsman's dismissal, finding no grave abuse of discretion. The ruling emphasizes the Ombudsman's independence and discretion, the presumption of good faith for public officers, and the petitioner's failure to demonstrate the elements of a violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. A deeper examination of the circumstances surrounding the reopening of the case against Palad could be pursued, especially given the subjectivity of the "manifest partiality" standard.
