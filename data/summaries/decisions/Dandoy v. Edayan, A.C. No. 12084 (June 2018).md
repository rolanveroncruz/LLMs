**Case Summary: *Hernanie P. Dandoy v. Atty. Roland G. Edayan*, A.C. No. 12084, June 06, 2018**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Roland G. Edayan for violation of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

**Facts:**

*   Atty. Edayan notarized a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) and a Deed of Extrajudicial Settlement of Real Estate where Jacinto Dandoy (deceased) was purportedly a signatory.
*   The SPA and Deed were used to mortgage land, resulting in foreclosure and prejudice to Dandoy and his siblings.
*   Complainant, Hernanie Dandoy, alleged his father, Jacinto, was deceased at the time of notarization. Death certificate provided as evidence.
*   Atty. Edayan admitted notarizing the documents, claiming he relied on residence certificates (cedulas) and confirmation from another signatory, Felipe Dandoy, for identification.

**Key Provisions Violated:**

*   **2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, Rule II, Section 12 (Competent Evidence of Identity):** Atty. Edayan failed to properly verify the identity of "Jacinto" using competent evidence, i.e., government-issued ID with photograph and signature, or oath/affirmation of credible witness NOT privy to the instrument. Cedula is not a valid form of identification.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), Canon 1, Rule 1.01:** Atty. Edayan engaged in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct by notarizing the documents with improper verification, undermining the integrity of the legal profession.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   **Duty to properly identify signatories:** Notaries public must ensure the person signing is the person they claim to be via prescribed means.
*   **Duty to uphold legal integrity:** Lawyers must not engage in dishonest conduct that undermines the public's trust in the legal profession.
*   **Duty to stay abreast of legal developments:** Lawyers are expected to be aware of changes in legal rules, including notarial practice.

**Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Edayan held liable for negligence as a notary public and as a lawyer.

**Penalties Imposed:**

*   Suspension from the practice of law for one (1) year.
*   Revocation of incumbent notarial commission (if any).
*   Disqualification from being commissioned as notary public for two (2) years.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Cedulas:** The Court clearly reiterated that reliance on residence certificates alone is insufficient and a violation of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice.
*   **Lack of Due Diligence:** Atty. Edayan's failure to notice the discrepancy between the purported "Jacinto's" signature and not seeking further ID raises concerns regarding proper diligence.
*   **Witness Credibility:** The Court specifically flagged that the testimony of Felipe Dandoy did not meet the requirements for the oath of a credible witness for identification under the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice.
*   **Lack of Acknowledgement**: Atty Edayan's continious affirmation that relying on Cedulas was enough is an aggravating factor as it implies a lack of understanding of the updated Notarial Practice law

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, Rule II, Section 12:** Sets forth the requirements for "competent evidence of identity."
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), Canon 1, Rule 1.01:** Prohibits lawyers from engaging in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.
*   **Jurisprudence:** The court cites multiple previous cases with similar penalty for the violation of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice like: *Baysac v. Aceron-Papa, Bartolome v. Basilio, Dizon v. Cabucana, Jr., Sappayani v. Gasmen, Isenhardt v. Real* These cases underscore the importance of adhering to notarial rules and the consequences of failing to do so.
