## Legal Document Summary: *Dimaporo v. COMELEC and Belmonte* (G.R. No. 179285)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65) assailing COMELEC resolutions regarding the 2007 congressional elections for the 1st District of Lanao del Norte.

**Key Issue:** Jurisdiction over an election dispute after proclamation, oath, and assumption of office of a Member of the House of Representatives.

**Facts:**

*   Dimaporo and Belmonte were candidates. During canvassing, ballot boxes from 3 municipalities were allegedly tampered.
*   COMELEC ordered the PBOC to retrieve the COCs from the tampered boxes, open them, and compare them. A new special board of canvassers was formed.
*   Belmonte objected to the inclusion of COCs due to alleged manifest errors (intercalations with correction fluid, tampering).
*   COMELEC 2nd Division granted Belmonte's petition, ordering exclusion of the questioned COCs and directing a reconvened Board to canvass, excluding the tampered COCs and proclaiming the winner.
*   Dimaporo filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied by COMELEC En Banc, resulting in a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   While the case was pending with a status quo ante order from the Supreme Court in place, Belmonte was proclaimed winner, took his oath, and assumed office.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court dismissed Dimaporo's petition.

**Reasoning:**

*   Jurisdiction shifts to the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET) once a winning candidate is proclaimed, takes their oath, and assumes office (Art. VI, Sec. 17, Constitution; *Lazatin v. COMELEC*; *Aggabao v. COMELEC*).
*   The status quo ante order was issued after Belmonte's proclamation, oath, and assumption of office, therefore the act of proclamation vested jurisdiction in the HRET.
*   The Court acknowledged the public interest and the policy that pre-proclamation controversies should be decided summarily (*Garcia v. CA*; *Vda. De Mesa v. Mencias*; *Sanchez v. COMELEC*).

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Section 15 of R.A. No. 7166:** Limits pre-proclamation cases for Congressional seats but allows *motu proprio* or upon complaint, the correction of manifest errors in COCs or election returns.

**Liabilities:**

*   The case does not explicitly assign liability but implies that Dimaporo may have to bear the cost of litigation.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Dimaporo's claim to the congressional seat is now solely within the jurisdiction of the HRET. She must file an election protest there.
*   The HRET's decision is final and not appealable to the Supreme Court on questions of fact.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article VI, Section 17 of the 1987 Constitution:** Establishes HRET's jurisdiction.
*   **Section 15 of R.A. No. 7166:** Limits pre-proclamation cases for Congressional seats but allows for correction of manifest errors.
*   ***Lazatin v. Commission on Elections*** (G.R. No. L-80007, January 25, 1988, 157 SCRA 337, 338).
*   ***Aggabao v. Commission on Elections*** (G.R. No. 163756, January 26, 2005, 449 SCRA 400, 404-405).
*   ***Garcia v. Court of Appeals*** (G.R. No. 31775, December 28, 1970, 36 SCRA 582).
*   ***Vda. De Mesa v. Mencias*** (G.R. No. L-24583, October 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 533, 538).
*   ***Sanchez v. Commission on Elections*** (G.R. No. L-78461, August 12, 1987, 153 SCRA 67, 75).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The central point of contention is whether the alleged "manifest errors" in the COCs constituted issues related to "preparation, transmission, receipt, custody and appreciation" of certificates of canvass, which would remove the matter from COMELEC jurisdiction. The COMELEC (2nd Division) ruled that this was an issue relating to manifest error, however, the Supreme Court did not make a determination on this.
