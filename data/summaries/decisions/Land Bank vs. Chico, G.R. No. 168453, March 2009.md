## Legal Document Summary - *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Chico*

**Case:** *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Hernando T. Chico and Lorna Chico* (G.R. No. 168453, March 13, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking reversal of CA decision affirming with modification the SAC's decision on just compensation for land acquired under agrarian reform.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Property:** 8.3027-hectare portion of irrigated rice land covered by TCT No. N-18893.
*   **Taking:** The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) took the property and transferred title to farmer-beneficiaries (FBs) in 1994 via Emancipation Patents (EPs) without prior notice to the landowner, Hernando Chico (Respondent).
*   **Dispute:** Respondent filed an action before the Special Agrarian Court (SAC) to determine just compensation. The Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) argues it has no obligation to pay because DAR did not endorse a Land Transfer Claim (LTC) folder, suggesting a Voluntary Land Transfer (VLT) agreement existed. LBP also claims that the Landowner-Tenant Production Agreement (LTPA) established the amount of compensation, or the farmer beneficiaries had already completed their amortization payment, either of which would excuse LBP from paying.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** SAC and CA ruled in favor of Respondent. Both Courts found the amount of just compensation was far more than the Landowner-Tenant Production Agreement, and that no agreement between the land owner and the FBs was actually agreed upon.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **LBP:** Ordered by the SAC (affirmed with modification by the CA) to pay the landowner just compensation for the expropriated land. Primary point of contention, is whether such obligation exists without formal transmittal of the claims folder by the DAR to LBP for funding of the land acquisition.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Absence of Land Transfer Claim (LTC) Folder:** LBP argues that the absence of an LTC endorsed by DAR absolves it of liability. This is a significant risk, as it challenges the procedural requirements for LBP's obligation to pay. However, the Supreme Court (SC) distinguished this case from *Crisologo-Jose v. Land Bank*, noting that in this case, actual taking and issuance of EPs to FBs *did* occur, therefore, a LTC folder is not necessary.
*   **Landowner-Tenant Production Agreement (LTPA):** LBP contends that the LTPA is a valid agreement establishing just compensation at P10,000 per hectare. Respondent disputes its validity. This poses a risk if the LTPA is deemed valid and binding, though the SAC and CA both found it to be invalid.
*   **Date of Taking:** LBP initially argued that the date of taking should be 1972 (PD 27), resulting in lower compensation. The CA applied RA 6657 as the controlling law, and was upheld by the Supreme Court.
*   **Interest:** The SC reversed the CA's imposition of 6% interest and the SAC's imposition of 12% interest, concluding that interest is unwarranted because the court accepted LBP's belief that the subject property acquisition was a VLT scheme.
*   **Amount:** SC upheld lower courts award for payment, saying they did not capriciously decide the payment amount.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Applied by the CA, which was upheld by the SC, in determining just compensation. Section 17 provides factors for determining just compensation (cost of acquisition, current value, nature, use, income, tax declarations, etc.).
*   **P.D. No. 27 (Emancipation of Tenants):** Originally invoked by LBP to argue for an earlier date of taking and lower valuation, but ultimately deemed suppletory to R.A. No. 6657.
*   **E.O. No. 228:** Also deemed suppletory to R.A. No. 6657.
*   ***Land Bank v. Natividad***, ***Meneses v. Secretary of Agrarian Reform***, ***Lubrica v. Land Bank***, ***Office of the President v. Court of Appeals***, and ***Paris v. Alfeche.*** - In this case, the Court made a comparative analysis of cases that confronted the issue of whether properties covered by P.D. No. 27 and E.O. No. 228, for which the landowners had yet to be paid, would be compensated under P.D. No. 27 and E.O. No. 228 or under the pertinent provisions of R.A. No. 6657.
*   **Land Bank v. Wycoco:** Cited regarding the imposition of 12% interest in cases of delay in payment.
*   **Crisologo-Jose v. Land Bank of the Philippines:** Distinguished on the facts, regarding the necessity of LTC folders and the fact of actual taking.
*   **Gabatin v. Land Bank of the Philippines** Court declared that the reckoning period for the determination of just compensation should be the time when the land was taken, i.e., in 1972, applying P.D. No. 27 and E.O. No. 228

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court largely affirmed the CA decision regarding the valuation of the land, but reversed the imposition of interest. A key risk in similar cases is the absence of an LTC folder, though this was mitigated here due to the undisputed taking and issuance of EPs. The case underscores the Court's equitable power to ensure just compensation for landowners, even when procedural requirements are not strictly followed and also the judicial authority over setting just compensation amounts.
