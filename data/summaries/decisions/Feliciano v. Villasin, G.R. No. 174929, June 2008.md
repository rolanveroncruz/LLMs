## Legal Document Summary: Feliciano v. Villasin, G.R. No. 174929

This document is a *certiorari* petition assailing the dismissal of a *quo warranto* petition filed by Engr. Ranulfo C. Feliciano against Nestor P. Villasin regarding the General Manager (GM) position at the Leyte Metropolitan Water District (LMWD). The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately *dismissed* Feliciano's petition, affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision.

**Key Provisions and Timeline:**

*   **1975:** Feliciano appointed GM of LMWD.
*   **1990:** Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) takes over LMWD due to debt default, pursuant to Presidential Decree (PD) No. 198.
*   **1991:** Feliciano dismissed by LMWD Board of Directors for Grave Misconduct, Dishonesty and Conduct Unbecoming an LMWD Official, based on an OGCC resolution. LMWD Resolution No. 18, Series of 1991.
*   **1993:** CSC Memorandum Circular No. 41 requires CSC approval of personnel appointments in water districts.
*   **1998:** LWUA takeover lifted; new LMWD Board reinstates Feliciano, LMWD Resolution No. 98-002.
*   **1999:** Feliciano makes appointments; CSC Regional Office disapproves because Feliciano lacks CSC-approved appointment.
*   **2000-2001:** CSC Resolution No. 002107 and No. 010218 deny Feliciano's appeal, deeming him a de facto officer, citing *Davao City Water District v. Civil Service Commission* (GR Nos. 95237-38, 201 SCRA 593).
*   **2004:** Republic Act No. 9286 amends PD No. 198, requiring "cause" and "due process" for GM removal.
*   **2005:** CSC Resolution No. 050307 orders Feliciano to vacate the GM position, declaring him a usurper since Feb 6, 2001. CA-G.R. SP No. 00489 temporarily enjoins the CSC Resolution (TRO).
*   **2005:** LMWD Board declares the GM position vacant and appoints Villasin as the new GM, LMWD Resolution No. 050307.
*   **2006:** Feliciano files *quo warranto* petition against Villasin (Civil Case No. 2006-03-29) in RTC. Petition dismissed by the RTC. This ruling is now assailed by the certiorari petition at hand.
*   **2006:** G.R. No. 172141 dismissed by the Supreme Court, upholding the legality of CSC Resolution No. 050307.
*   **2008:** This petition, G.R. No. 174929, is dismissed by the Supreme Court.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Feliciano:** Duty to submit his appointment to the CSC for attestation as per CSC Memorandum Circular 41 and CSC Resolutions.  Failure to comply resulted in him being deemed a *de facto* officer and subsequently a usurper. Feliciano held liable for FORUM SHOPPING
*   **Villasin:** As the appointed GM, obligated to fulfill the duties of the office.
*   **LMWD Board:** Power to appoint the GM, and remove the GM with cause and due process, subject to Civil Service rules.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Feliciano:** Further legal action could arise from his actions as a de facto officer after his initial dismissal, as well as his potential criminal liability for usurpation. Possible sanctions for forum shopping.
*   **LMWD:** Risk of destabilization if Villasin's appointment is challenged.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree (PD) No. 198:** *The Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973*. Governs the formation and administration of local water districts. Amended by PD No. 768, PD No. 1479, and Republic Act No. 9286.
*   **Republic Act No. 9286:** Further amends PD No. 198, requiring "cause" and "due process" for GM removal.
*   **Davao City Water District v. Civil Service Commission (GR Nos. 95237-38, 201 SCRA 593):** Establishes that water districts are government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters, subject to CSC jurisdiction. Cited as basis for CSC's assertion of authority.
*   **Villaluz v. Zaldivar, 122 Phil. 1091 (1965):** Cited by Feliciano, but deemed inapplicable.
*   **Villaluz v. Zaldivar, 122 Phil. 1091 (1965):** Cited by Feliciano, but deemed inapplicable.
*   **Garcia v. Perez, G.R. No. L-28184, 11 September 1980, 99 SCRA 628:** Established in actions for Quo Warranto to determine title to a public office, the complaint, to be sufficient in form, must show that the plaintiff is entitled to the office.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 66 and Rule 7:** Pertain to Quo Warranto and Forum Shopping

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Applicability of Civil Service Rules:** While PD No. 1479 clarified the applicability of civil service rules to water districts and their employees, Feliciano still argued that as GM, his appointment was not subject to CSC attestation.
*   **Definition of "Cause" and "Due Process":** Republic Act No. 9286 requires "cause" and "due process" for GM removal, but the precise meaning of these terms could be subject to interpretation and future litigation.
*   **"De Facto" vs. "De Jure" Officer:** The CSC Resolution made a distinction between Feliciano's status before and after a certain date, creating a hybrid situation.

**SC Ruling & Rationale:**

The SC dismissed Feliciano's petition on multiple grounds:

1.  **Failure to Implead RTC:** Petitioner fails to include RTC as part of the Certiorari.
2.  **Lack of Merit:** Feliciano lacked a clear legal right to the GM position, especially after the SC upheld CSC Resolution No. 050307 in G.R. No. 172141. A Quo Warranto petition can be dismissed at any stage if the plaintiff's claim is obviously deficient, citing *Garcia v. Perez*.
3.  **Validity of CSC Resolution:** The SC reiterated the validity of CSC's order for Feliciano to vacate the GM position, upholding the *Davao City Water District* precedent.
4.  **Forum Shopping:** Feliciano engaged in forum shopping by repeatedly litigating the legality of his termination.
5.  **Coverage of Civil Service Rules:** The SC affirmed that the GM position is covered by civil service rules.

**Conclusion:** The SC decision firmly establishes that water districts are government instrumentalities subject to civil service laws and that Feliciano had no legal basis to challenge Villasin's appointment. The decision underscores the importance of complying with CSC regulations and avoiding forum shopping.
