Here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Salvador Nieto y Cabalse @ “Ador”* (G.R. No. 177756, March 3, 2008)

**Facts:** Accused-Appellant Nieto was convicted of two counts of simple rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353) against AAA, a 24-year-old woman with a mental age of 5 years and 3 months, on two separate occasions. The RTC sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* for each count, plus civil indemnity and exemplary damages. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but added moral damages.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Rape of a Person Deprived of Reason:** The case hinges on the victim's mental state at the time of the offenses, qualifying her as "deprived of reason." *Art. 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed.-Rape is committed...b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious. (Revised ` Penal Code).*
*   **Credibility of Victim's Testimony:** The defense challenged the victim's credibility due to alleged discrepancies in her testimony regarding a prior rape incident. The SC affirmed the lower courts' reliance on her testimony, finding it categorical, straightforward, and corroborated by medical evidence.
*   **Defense of Alibi:** Nieto presented an alibi, claiming to be elsewhere at the time of the offenses. The Court rejected this defense, finding it weak, unsubstantiated, and contradicted by the fact that it was physically possible for him to be at the scene of the crime.
*   **Medical Evidence:** Testimony of Dr. Llamas established that AAA's hymen had a day-old healed laceration at the 6 o'clock position, which, according to Dr. Llamas, could have resulted from sexual intercourse

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Nieto is held criminally liable for two counts of simple rape, punishable by *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:** Nieto is liable for:
    *   Civil indemnity (P50,000 per count): Automatic upon finding of rape.
    *   Moral damages (P50,000 per count): Automatic award to rape victim.
    *  Exemplary damages: were deleted by the court for want of legal basis.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility Challenges:**  Despite the ruling, the cross-examination highlights a potential avenue for challenging the victim's clarity and recall, even if ultimately unsuccessful.
*   **Alibi Evidence:** The reliance on family members' testimony for the alibi could be viewed as biased.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 335 (amended by RA 8353):** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 266-A:** Rape is committed
*   **Article 2230 of the New Civil Code:** Addresses awarding of exemplary damages
*   **People v. Mateo (G.R. Nos. 147678-87, 7 July 2004, 433 SCRA 640):** Case relating to transmittal of appeal of this kind to Court of Appeals.
*   **People v. Cabalquinto (G.R. No. 167693, 19 September 2006, 502 SCRA 419):** This case is referenced for the anonymization policy for victims of sexual violence.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and the Court of Appeals ruling that the trial court's findings are supported by clear, convincing, and credible evidence. The only modification was the deletion of exemplary damages, however the civil and moral damages remain. The denial and alibi provided by the accused were insufficient to overcome the positive identification and testimony of the victim, as well as the medical evidence presented.
