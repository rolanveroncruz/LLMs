## Legal Document Summary: People v. Gamboa

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Manuel Gamboa y Francisco @ "Kuya"

**Citation:** G.R. No. 233702, June 20, 2018 (833 Phil. 1055)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines (Second Division)

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of conviction for Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs (Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or "Shabu") under Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, RA 9165:** Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs. Requires proof of identity of buyer and seller, object (dangerous drug), consideration (payment), delivery, and payment.
*   **Section 11, Article II, RA 9165:** Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs. Requires proof of possession, lack of legal authorization, and conscious possession.
*   **Section 21, Article II, RA 9165 (Pre-RA 10640 Amendment):** Chain of Custody Rule for seized drugs. Mandates physical inventory and photography immediately after seizure, in the presence of the accused, a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official, all of whom must sign the inventory. The seized drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within 24 hours.

**Facts:**

*   Buy-bust operation conducted against Gamboa based on information that he was selling shabu.
*   Poseur-buyer (PO2 Nieva) allegedly purchased shabu from Gamboa.
*   Gamboa was arrested and found in possession of another sachet of shabu.
*   Seized items were marked and inventoried at the place of arrest in the presence of Gamboa and a media representative. No DOJ representative or elected public official was present.
*   Drugs tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride.
*   Gamboa denied the charges, claiming he was arrested for vagrancy.

**Lower Court Rulings:**

*   **RTC (Regional Trial Court):** Convicted Gamboa of both Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession. Found the chain of custody unbroken and that the absence of a DOJ representative and a barangay official during the inventory was not fatal.
*   **CA (Court of Appeals):** Affirmed the RTC ruling.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Reversed and set aside the CA decision; Gamboa acquitted.**
*   Held that the police officers committed unjustified deviations from the chain of custody rule under Section 21 of RA 9165 (pre-RA 10640 amendment), compromising the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs.
*   The absence of an elected public official and a DOJ representative during the inventory and marking was not justified. The prosecution failed to provide a plausible explanation for the non-compliance.
*   Mere statements of unavailability, without serious attempts to contact the required witnesses, are insufficient.
*   The prosecution failed to prove the integrity of the *corpus delicti* beyond reasonable doubt.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Law Enforcement:** Strict adherence to Section 21, RA 9165 is required to maintain the integrity and evidentiary value of seized drugs. Must justify any deviations with plausible explanations.
*   **Prosecution:** Has the burden of proving compliance with Section 21, RA 9165, and must justify any perceived deviations. Failure to do so can lead to acquittal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Failure to strictly comply with Section 21, RA 9165 can result in the suppression of evidence and the acquittal of the accused, particularly in cases involving small quantities of drugs.
*   Reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty is insufficient to overcome evidence of non-compliance with Section 21, RA 9165.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Mendoza*, 736 Phil. 749 (2014): Emphasizes the importance of the presence of media and DOJ representatives during seizure and marking to prevent evidence tampering.
*   *People v. Almorfe*, 631 Phil. 51 (2010): Requires the prosecution to explain reasons for procedural lapses and prove the integrity of seized evidence.
*   *People v. De Guzman*, 630 Phil. 637 (2010): Justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21 must be proven as a fact.
*   *People v. Umipang*, 686 Phil. 1024 (2012): Requires earnest efforts to contact the required witnesses and deems mere statements of unavailability insufficient.
*   *People v. Sagana*, G.R. No. 208471, August 2, 2017: three witnesses were intended as a guarantee against planting of evidence and frame up
*    *People v. Teng Moner y Adam*, G.R. No. 202206, March 5, 2018: chain of custody rule is a matter of evidence and a rule of procedure, and that the Court has the last say regarding the appreciation of evidence
*   **IRR of RA 9165:** Defines procedures and provides exceptions to strict compliance with Section 21 requirements.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   "Justifiable grounds" for non-compliance with Section 21 is subject to interpretation and requires clear justification from law enforcement.
*   The level of "earnest efforts" required to secure the presence of the required witnesses is also open to interpretation.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of strict compliance with the chain of custody rule in drug cases to ensure the integrity of the evidence and prevent abuses. The prosecution's failure to justify the absence of the required witnesses at the inventory and marking of the seized drugs was fatal to its case, leading to the acquittal of the accused. This case highlights the need for law enforcement agencies to be diligent in following the prescribed procedures and documenting their efforts to comply with the law.
