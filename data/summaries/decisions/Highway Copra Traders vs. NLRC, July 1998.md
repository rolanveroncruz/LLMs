## Legal Document Summary: Highway Copra Traders vs. NLRC & Empeynado (G.R. No. 108889)

**Nature:** Supreme Court Decision on Illegal Dismissal Case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Employee Status:** Private respondent Empeynado, initially hired as a general utility man, is declared a regular employee under Article 280 of the Labor Code. The court emphasizes that his activities (weighing, bagging copra/charcoal, driving, mechanic, messenger) were necessary and desirable to the employer's copra trading business.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Empeynado's termination was deemed illegal, as he was told not to report for work and not re-hired.
*   **Remedies:** The NLRC ordered reinstatement with backwages. If reinstatement is impractical due to lawful supervening events, separation pay of three months' salary will be awarded.
*   **Backwages Calculation:** Backwages are to be calculated from the date of lay-off (January 12, 1987) until January 11, 1990, in accordance with the "Mercury Drug Rule" (3-year limit) since the illegal dismissal occurred before Republic Act No. 6715 (Herrera-Veloso Law) took effect on March 21, 1989.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer (Highway Copra Traders):** Obligated to reinstate Empeynado and pay backwages, unpaid wages, salary differentials, and proportionate 13th-month pay, less cash advances. If reinstatement is impractical, they must pay separation pay.
*   **Labor Arbiter:** Tasked with determining the impracticability of reinstatement during the execution stage and computing separation pay accordingly.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Employer:** Joint and several liability for monetary awards. Liable for illegal dismissal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Impracticability of Reinstatement:** The Labor Arbiter will determine if reinstatement is impractical due to any lawful supervening event. This introduces uncertainty and could lead to further litigation if the parties dispute the basis for such a determination.
*   **Execution Stage Disputes:** Computation of backwages and the determination of any income earned by Empeynado during the period of illegal dismissal may give rise to disputes during the execution proceedings. Proof of income earned elsewhere must be presented.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 280, Labor Code:** Defines regular vs. casual employment.
*   **Article 279, Labor Code (as amended by RA 6715):**  Governs security of tenure and remedies for illegal dismissal (not applicable since illegal dismissal occurred before the amendment).
*   **Republic Act No. 6715 (Herrera-Veloso Law):** Amended Article 279, but its provisions on backwages are not applied retroactively.
*   **Mercury Drug Co., Inc., et al. vs. CIR, et al. (56 SCRA 694):** Established the 3-year cap on backwages for dismissals before RA 6715.
*   **Ferrer vs. NLRC (G.R. No. 100898):**  Allows deduction of earnings made by the employee during the dismissal period (potentially applicable during execution).
*   **Baguio Country Club Corporation vs. NLRC (206 SCRA 643):** Reinforces the principle of safeguarding employee tenure.
*   **Bustamante vs. NLRC (265 SCRA 61):** Clarifies backwages calculation for illegal dismissals *after* the RA 6715 amendment.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Lawful Supervening Event"**: This phrase is ambiguous regarding the determination to deny reinstatement.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the NLRC's decision, finding the employee to be a regular employee who was illegally dismissed. The backwages are to be calculated under the "Mercury Drug Rule," capping them at three years. The primary risk lies in potential disputes during execution proceedings, particularly regarding the determination of the practicability of reinstatement and calculation of backwages with considerations for income earned elsewhere. The phrase 'lawful supervening event' is open to interpretation and could cause further dispute.
