**Case Summary: *AFP General Insurance Corporation vs. Noel Molina, et al.*, G.R. No. 151133, June 30, 2008**

**Nature:** Review on *certiorari* of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the NLRC's denial of AFPGIC's motion to quash a writ of garnishment against an appeal bond.

**Facts:** Private respondents (employees) won an illegal dismissal case against Radon Security. Radon Security appealed to the NLRC, posting a surety bond from AFPGIC. The NLRC affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision with modification. Radon Security's appeal to the Supreme Court was dismissed. When the NLRC decision became final, a writ of execution was issued and the NLRC Sheriff garnished the supersedeas bond. AFPGIC moved to quash the writ, arguing the bond was cancelled due to Radon Security's non-payment of premiums. The Labor Arbiter denied the motion, and the NLRC affirmed. The Court of Appeals upheld the NLRC's decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 223 of the Labor Code & Section 6, Rule VI of the NLRC Rules of Procedure:**  Mandate the posting of a cash or surety bond by the employer as the exclusive means of perfecting an appeal involving a monetary award in a labor case.  The bond must be effective until final disposition of the case.
*   **Section 177 of the Insurance Code:**  A surety bond, once accepted by the obligee, becomes valid and enforceable, irrespective of whether or not the premium has been paid by the obligor.
*   **Section 176 of the Insurance Code:** Affirms solidary liability between the surety and the obligor.

**Liabilities:**

*   **AFPGIC (Surety):** Liable on the bond until formally discharged. The court determined that non-payment of premiums by the principal (Radon Security) does not automatically discharge the surety's obligation to the winning employees (obligees). AFPGIC is obligated to comply with the writ of garnishment.
*   **Radon Security (Principal/Obligor):** Jointly and severally liable with AFPGIC for the monetary award.
*   **Ever Emporium, Inc.:** Held jointly and severally liable with Radon Security for the monetary award.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **For AFPGIC:** Immediate financial liability to the extent of the bond. Risk of delayed or incomplete recovery from Radon Security due to its financial status.
*   **For Radon Security:** Continued liability for the judgment amount, plus potential legal action and costs from AFPGIC to recover amounts paid under the bond and unpaid premiums.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** The main point of contention was whether AFPGIC could unilaterally cancel the surety bond *vis-a-vis* the employee beneficiaries due to Radon Security's non-payment of premiums, without notice to the NLRC. The court decisively ruled against AFPGIC.

**Key Holding:**  A surety bond posted in a labor appeal remains effective until final disposition of the case, and the surety cannot unilaterally cancel the bond for non-payment of premiums without notice to the NLRC and the beneficiaries. The Court prioritized labor protection, viewing the appeal bond as crucial to ensuring judgment satisfaction.  AFPGIC's remedy is to seek reimbursement from Radon Security.

**Implications:**

This decision reinforces the stringent requirements for employers appealing labor judgments involving monetary awards. It protects employees by preventing employers from evading judgment through non-payment of surety bond premiums. It also underscores the importance of sureties diligently monitoring premium payments and notifying relevant parties of any potential lapse to mitigate potential liability.
