**Legal Document Summary: *Tabuada v. Certeza***

**Case:** *Sofia Tabuada, et al. v. Eleanor Tabuada, et al.* (G.R. No. 196510, September 12, 2018)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to reverse the CA decision which reversed the RTC decision declaring the nullity of a mortgage and damages.

**Key Issue:** Validity of a real estate mortgage constituted by a person impersonating a deceased titleholder.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Article 2085 of the Civil Code:** Outlines the requisites for a valid mortgage: (1) securing a principal obligation, (2) mortgagor is the absolute owner, and (3) mortgagor has free disposal or is legally authorized.
*   **Obligations of Mortgagor:** To possess rightful ownership and legal capacity/authorization to mortgage the property.
*   **Obligations of Mortgagee:** To exercise prudence and due diligence in ascertaining the mortgagor's identity and authority, especially when circumstances suggest potential irregularities.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Nullity of Mortgage:** The mortgage was declared null and void because it was constituted by Eleanor Tabuada, impersonating the deceased titleholder, Loreta Tabuada, four years after her death. Eleanor Tabuada lacked ownership and authorization. This violates Art. 2085.
*   **Mortgagee Not in Good Faith:** The Spouses Certeza (mortgagees) were not considered mortgagees in good faith. They had knowledge that the petitioners were the relatives by blood or affinity of their co-defendants and residents of the property. They failed to exercise due diligence by inquiring into Eleanor Tabuada's authority to mortgage, despite the presence of other residents on the property. *Embrado v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 51457, June 27, 1994, 233 SCRA 335) and *Ereña v. Querrer-Kauffman* (G.R. No. 165853, June 22, 2006, 492 SCRA 298, 320) was cited to emphasize the due diligence requirement.
*   **Proof of Legal Relationship:** The Supreme Court emphasized that proof of legal relationship can be established by totality of evidence including testimonial and circumstantial evidence and not strictly limited to authenticated documentary evidence from NSO/PSA. *People v. Sales* (G.R. No. 177218, October 3, 2011, 658 SCRA 367) was cited on the matter of establishing filiation.
*   **Reversal of Moral Damages:** The RTC's award of moral damages based on disrespect to the dead (Article 309 of the Civil Code) was reversed. The Court ruled that Article 309 envisions disrespect committed during mourning or funeral rites, not a fraudulent act several years after death.

**Liabilities:**

*   Eleanor Tabuada, Julieta Trabuco, Laureta Redondo, and Spouses Bernan and Eleanor Certeza are held jointly and severally liable to the petitioners for attorney's fees and costs of suit.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Due Diligence Standard:** The level of due diligence required of mortgagees can be a contentious issue, depending on the specific circumstances. The decision highlights the need for inquiry when red flags exist (e.g., presence of other residents, knowledge of familial relationships).
*   **Proof of Identity and Authority:** Future cases may hinge on the quality of evidence presented to establish identity and authority to mortgage, particularly in situations involving impersonation or potentially fraudulent documents.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 2085:** Requisites of a valid mortgage.
*   **Civil Code, Article 309:** Disrespect to the dead (basis for moral damages; deemed inapplicable in this case).
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 128:** General Provisions (admissibility of evidence)
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 130:** Rules for admissibility of object, documentary, and testimonial evidence.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 133:** Preponderance of Evidence.
*   ***Embrado v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 51457, June 27, 1994, 233 SCRA 335:** Due diligence required of persons dealing with realty.
*   ***Ereña v. Querrer-Kauffman*, G.R. No. 165853, June 22, 2006, 492 SCRA 298, 320:** Mortgagee in Good Faith.
*   ***People v. Sales*, G.R. No. 177218, October 3, 2011, 658 SCRA 367:** On the matter of establishing filiation.

**Overall Assessment:**

The decision reinforces the importance of verifying the identity and authority of a mortgagor. It clarifies that mortgagees cannot claim good faith if they ignored circumstances that should have prompted further inquiry. The reversal of moral damages highlights the narrow application of Article 309 in cases of disrespect to the dead. This case also confirms that relationship may be established through other relevant evidence and not limited to documentary evidence.
