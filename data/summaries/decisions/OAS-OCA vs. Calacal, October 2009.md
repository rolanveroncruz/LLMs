**Key Provisions/Facts:**
*   Respondent left the country for Singapore from May 15, 2008, to June 6, 2008.
*   Respondent did not obtain the required travel authority from the OCA as mandated by OCA Circular No. 49-2003.
*   Respondent claimed unawareness of OCA Circular No. 49-2003.
*   Respondent's leave application was approved by the Clerk of Court, but lacked OCA travel authority.

**Obligations:**

**Liabilities:**
*   Respondent was found guilty of violating reasonable office rules and regulations per Rule IV, Section 52 (C) (3) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.

**Sanctions:**
*   Reprimand.
*   Warning that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be penalized more severely.

**Statutory References:**
*   OCA Circular No. 49-2003 (B) (4) - mandates travel authority and stipulates disciplinary action for non-compliance.
*   Rule IV, Section 52 (C) (3) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service - provides the basis for the finding of guilt.

**Case Law References:**
*   *Noynay-Arlos v. Selconag, A.M. No. P-01-1503, January 27, 2004, 421 SCRA 138, 146* - Establishes that unawareness of a circular is not an excuse for non-compliance.
*   *Reports on the Financial Audit Conducted on the Books of Accounts of OIC Melinda Deseo, MTC, General Trias, Cavite, A.M. No. 99-11-157-MTC, August 7, 2000, 337 SCRA 347, 352* - Same principle as above.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**
*   The respondent's unawareness of the circular, while not an excuse, could potentially be argued as a mitigating circumstance, though unsuccessful here. The Court is firm that it is the personnel's obligation to be aware of internal rules.
*   The approval of the leave by the Clerk of Court could be misconstrued as an implicit approval for the travel, but the Court underscores the necessity of obtaining the specific OCA travel authority.

**Conclusion:**

This document is a resolution finding the respondent, Rodrigo C. Calacal, administratively liable for violating OCA Circular No. 49-2003 by leaving the country without the required travel authority. The key legal principle affirmed is that ignorance of internal office rules is not a valid defense for non-compliance. He was reprimanded and warned of more severe penalties for subsequent violations.
