## Legal Document Summary: *Alberto Granton v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 226045

**Case Overview:** This is a *certiorari* appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Alberto Granton for two counts of Rape through Sexual Assault under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately *denied* the petition but *modified* the CA ruling.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Original Charges:** Two counts of Rape through Sexual Assault for allegedly inserting his finger into the vagina of a two-year-old child (CCC) on separate dates.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Prosecution:** Testimony of the victim (CCC, 4 years old at trial), the housekeeper (NNN), the victim's mother (MMM), a medico-legal officer (Dr. Maribeth R. Aguilar), and SP02 Evelyn Bernal.
    *   **Defense:** Denial and alibi. Testimonies of Alberto, Arturo Cadano (father of Alberto's common-law wife), and Mary Jane Enriquez (Alberto's common-law wife).
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty on both counts. Relied on CCC's testimony and corroborating medical findings (abrasion/laceration). Rejected alibi.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed conviction but modified the penalty based on R.A. No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act). Held medical certificate was corroborative, not essential.
*   **SC Ruling:** Upheld the conviction but modified the nomenclature of the offense to **Acts of Lasciviousness** under Article 336 of the RPC, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610. Modified penalty and damages.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Conviction for:** Two counts of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of Republic Act No. 7610.
*   **Penalty:** Indeterminate imprisonment of 12 years and 1 day of *reclusion temporal* (minimum) to 15 years, 6 months, and 21 days of *reclusion temporal* (medium) for each count.
*   **Damages:** The victim should receive moral damages and exemplary damages in the amount of Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00) each and Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) as civil indemnity for each count committed.
*   **Interest:** All damages awarded shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Factual Issues Raised:** The petition originally contested the credibility of the victim's testimony and the weight of the medical certificate, framing the appeal on issues primarily factual in nature. While generally beyond the scope of *certiorari*, the SC addressed the merits.
*   **Reliance on Child Testimony:** The conviction heavily relies on the testimony of a child victim. While the courts gave it "full weight and credit," this can be a contentious point subject to scrutiny.
*   **Retroactive Application:** The application of *People v. Macapagal* to modify the nomenclature of the offense to Acts of Lasciviousness is significant. The court's rationale for prioritizing R.A. No. 7610 over R.A. No. 8353 (amending the RPC) is a key legal point.
*   **Lack of Demonstrable Ill-Motive:** The court emphasized the absence of evidence indicating ill-motive on the part of prosecution witnesses, a factor strengthening the credibility of their testimonies.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Art. 266-A (Rape through Sexual Assault), Art. 336 (Acts of Lasciviousness).
*   **Republic Act No. 7610:** Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act (Section 5(b), Article III specifically).
*   **Republic Act No. 8353:** Amends the Revised Penal Code on Rape.
*   ***People v. Macapagal*** (G.R. No. 218574, November 22, 2017): Basis for modifying the offense nomenclature.
*   ***People v. Chingh***
*   ***People v. Noel Go Caoili***
*   ***People v. Dimakuta***

**Summary for Lawyer:**

This case involves the conviction of Alberto Granton for sexual acts against a minor. While the initial conviction was for Rape through Sexual Assault, the SC, relying on *People v. Macapagal*, modified the charge to Acts of Lasciviousness under R.A. 7610, prioritizing it over the amended RPC provisions on rape due to the victim's age. The key evidence was the child's testimony, deemed credible despite arguments questioning her reaction. The defense of alibi was rejected. This case highlights the application of R.A. 7610 in cases of sexual offenses against children and the importance of child victim testimony. Further research into the *Macapagal* ruling and its impact on similar cases is recommended. The damages awarded and potential for further appeal should also be considered.
