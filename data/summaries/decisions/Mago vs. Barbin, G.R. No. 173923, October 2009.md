## Legal Document Summary: *Pedro Mago vs. Juana Z. Barbin* (G.R. No. 173923)

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board's (DARAB) order to cancel the Emancipation Patents (EPs) of the petitioners (Pedro, Augusto, and Ernesto Mago) due to their failure to pay amortizations under a direct payment scheme with the respondent (Juana Z. Barbin). The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately **denied** the petition.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Cancellation of EPs:** EPs can be cancelled despite registration, if there are irregularities in their issuance or non-compliance with attached conditions (citing *Mercado v. Mercado* and *Gabriel v. Jamias*).
*   **Grounds for Cancellation:** DAR Administrative Order No. 02, series of 1994, lists grounds for EP cancellation, including failure to pay amortizations in a direct payment scheme.
*   **Direct Payment Scheme:** The petitioners entered into a direct payment scheme (Deeds of Transfer) with the respondent.
*   **Failure to Pay Amortizations:** The petitioners failed to remit amortizations as agreed upon, justifying cancellation under DAR A.O. No. 02, s. 1994. The Court found that the evidence of payment was insufficient or non-existent.
*   **Indefeasibility of Title:** The SC rejected the argument that the registered EPs and TCTs (Transfer Certificates of Title) had become indefeasible. Registration does not shield EPs from scrutiny or cancellation for violations of agrarian laws.
*   **Full Payment Requirement:** The SC emphasized that EPs should only be issued *after* full payment of just compensation (citing P.D. No. 266, E.O. No. 228, and *Coruña v. Cinamin*). It reaffirmed the principle that ownership under P.D. No. 27 is contingent upon full payment.

**Obligations:**

*   **Farmer-Beneficiaries (Petitioners):** Obligated to remit amortization payments to the landowner (Respondent) under the agreed-upon direct payment scheme, as stipulated in the Deeds of Transfer.
*   **Landowner (Respondent):** Entitled to receive just compensation for the land transferred under P.D. No. 27.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Farmer-Beneficiaries (Petitioners):** Liable to have their EPs cancelled and the land reallocated if they fail to meet their amortization obligations, based on their agreement with the landowner or fail to pay for at least 3 annual amortizations to the LBP except for fortutitous events and force majeure.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Land Ownership:** Failure to comply with amortization payments can lead to the cancellation of EPs and the reallocation of land to other qualified beneficiaries.
*   **Legal Action:** Landowners can pursue legal action to cancel EPs and recover possession of land if farmer-beneficiaries fail to meet their financial obligations.
*   **Invalidation of Emancipation:** If the land was not paid in full the Emancipation Patent would be null.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 27 (PD 27):** Emancipation of Tenants.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 266:** Mechanics of Registration of Ownership and/or Title to Land under PD 27.
*   **Executive Order No. 228 (EO 228):** Manner of payment by farmer beneficiaries covered by PD 27 and the mode of compensation to the landowner.
*   **Letter of Instruction No. 474 (LOI 474):** Directs placement of tenanted rice/corn lands under Land Transfer Program pursuant to PD 27.
*   **DAR Administrative Order No. 02, Series of 1994:** Grounds for cancellation of registered EPs or CLOAs.
*   ***Mercado v. Mercado*** **(G.R. No. 178672):** Mere issuance of EP does not put ownership beyond attack.
*   ***Gabriel v. Jamias*** **(G.R. No. 156482):** EPs may be corrected and cancelled for violations of agrarian laws.
*   ***Coruña v. Cinamin*** **(G.R. No. 154286):** Mandates full compensation before issuance of EPs.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The main point of contention revolves around whether the petitioners actually made the required amortization payments. The Court of Appeals, siding with the DARAB, found that the evidence presented by the petitioners was insufficient to prove that they had complied with their obligations under the direct payment scheme.
