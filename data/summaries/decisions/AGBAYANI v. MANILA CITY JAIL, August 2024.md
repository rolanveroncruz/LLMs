**Summary of G.R. No. 268876, August 07, 2024: *Dr. Benigno A. Agbayani, Jr. vs. Director of Manila City Jail***

**Nature of the Document:** Resolution on a Petition for Habeas Corpus.

**Key Provisions & Holding:** The Supreme Court *dismissed* the Petition for Habeas Corpus filed on behalf of Dr. Agbayani, who was incarcerated for reckless imprudence resulting in serious physical injuries, for the following reasons:

1.  **Habeas Corpus is the Wrong Remedy:** Dr. Agbayani's confinement was pursuant to a final and executory judgment rendered by the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. 215121. Habeas corpus is not available to a person imprisoned under a lawful judgment. (Rule 102, Sec. 4, Rules of Court).
2.  **Principle of Immutability of Judgment:** The Court's Resolutions in G.R. No. 215121 had already become final and executory. The legal correctness of the dismissal of Dr. Agbayani’s appeal before the RTC Manila can no longer be assailed.
3.  **Res Judicata:** The Supreme Court’s rulings on the dismissal of Dr. Agbayani's appeal constitute res judicata to this petition challenging its validity.
4.  **Violation of Hierarchy of Courts:** The Petition should have been filed before the lower court. The court stated that petitions for habeas corpus fall under the concurrent jurisdiction of the RTC, the CA, and the Court, and hence, should have been filed before the RTC.
5. **Moot and Academic:** The supervening death of Dr. Agbayani rendered the Petition moot and academic.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Dr. Agbayani was obligated to serve the sentence imposed for reckless imprudence.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The dissent argued that Dr. Agbayani was deprived of his liberty without due process because of the incorrect application of the Rules of Court, the issues are now moot because of his death.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 102, Sections 1, 2, and 4 of the Rules of Court:** Scope and limitations of Habeas Corpus.
*   **Rule 40, Section 7(b) of the Rules of Court:** Duty to submit memorandum on appeal; failure to do so is ground for dismissal.
*   **Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code:** Penalties for imprudence and negligence.
*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 129:** Jurisdiction of Metropolitan Trial Courts.
*   **G.R. No. 215121:** Previous Supreme Court decision upholding the conviction.
*   ***Mangila v. Pangilinan, 714 Phil. 204, 208-209 (2013) [Per J. Bersamin, First Division]*
*   ***In the Matter of the Petition for Habeas Corpus of Datukan Malang Salibo v. Warden, Quezon City Jail Annex, 757 Phil. 630, 644 (2015) [Per J. Leonen, Second Division]*
*   ***Gerobiese v. People, G.R. No. 221006, July 7, 2021 [Per J. Leonen, Third Division]*

**Overall Assessment:** The Supreme Court rejected the Petition for Habeas Corpus, emphasizing the finality of judgment, lack of jurisdiction, and proper venue.
