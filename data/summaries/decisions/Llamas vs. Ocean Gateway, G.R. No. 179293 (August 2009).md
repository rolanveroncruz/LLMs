**Case Summary: *Eden Llamas v. Ocean Gateway Maritime and Management, Inc.*** (G.R. No. 179293, August 14, 2009)

**Nature:** Illegal Dismissal Complaint

**Facts:**

*   Eden Llamas (Petitioner), Accounting Manager, was terminated by Ocean Gateway Maritime and Management, Inc. (Respondent) for gross and habitual neglect of duty and/or serious misconduct/willful disobedience, based on failure to timely remit SSS/PhilHealth contributions and underreporting company income.
*   Petitioner claimed workload and lack of assistance caused the delays, and argued the underreporting benefited the company.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding the Labor Arbiter's finding of valid dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 282(b) of the Labor Code:**  Just cause for termination includes gross and habitual neglect of duty.
*   **Employee Obligation:** To diligently perform assigned duties, including timely remittance of government contributions and accurate financial reporting.
*   **Employer Obligation:**  To provide due process (notice and opportunity to be heard) prior to termination.

**Liabilities & Just Cause for Dismissal:**

*   **Gross and Habitual Neglect of Duty:** The Court found the Petitioner's repeated failures to remit SSS/PhilHealth contributions, resulting in penalties for the Respondent, constituted gross and habitual neglect. *Tres Reyes v. Maxim's Tea House, et al.* (G.R. No. 140853, February 27, 2003) defines this as acting with conscious indifference to consequences.
*   **Serious Misconduct:** Petitioner's admission of underreporting company income to City Hall for licensing purposes was deemed serious misconduct because it was willful, potentially illegal, and put the company at risk of legal liability. *Fujitsu Computer Products v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 158232. March 31, 2005) defines the elements of serious misconduct.
*   The Court held that an employer cannot be compelled to retain an employee whose actions are inimical to its interests. The court referenced *Amadeo Fishing Corporation v. Nierra* (G.R. No. 163099, October 4, 2005) in support of this.
*   **Salary Deductions:** The court did not find that the salary deductions were illegal as it was a penalty for non-remittance of the company contributions to SSS and PhilHealth.

**Due Process:**

*   Respondent complied with due process by issuing a show cause order, detailing the charges, and providing Petitioner an opportunity to respond.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity in "Gross Negligence":**  The definition of "gross negligence" can be fact-dependent and subject to interpretation. The frequency and impact of the negligence are key considerations.
*   **Dishonesty:** The Petitioner's declaration that "I believe that I did something good for our office when our declaration of gross income submitted to City Hall for the renewal of our municipal license was lower than our actual gross income for which the office had paid a lower amount," was considered as serious misconduct.
*   **Salary deductions may be illegal deductions.**

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 282(b)** (Just Causes for Termination)
*   **Social Security System (SSS) Law, as amended**
*   **National Health Insurance Act (PhilHealth)**
