**Summary for Legal Counsel: *Samson Lim Bio Hian vs. Joaquin Lim Eng Tian***

This case (G.R. No. 195472 & 195568) involves a petition for review on certiorari seeking to overturn the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision nullifying the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) orders which allowed petitioners to cross-examine the respondent in an action for partition (Civil Case No. 08-0246). The core issue is whether the petitioners should have been allowed to cross-examine the respondent after failing to appear at the pre-trial conference and/or failing to file a pre-trial brief in a timely manner.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Partition Action:** Respondent (Joaquin) initiated the action for partition due to disagreement with petitioners (Samson & Johnson) regarding the division of co-owned land (TCT No. 81239).
*   **Pre-Trial Brief & Appearance:** Petitioners failed to appear for the pre-trial conference and file a pre-trial brief on time.
*   **RTC Orders:** The RTC initially granted motions for reconsideration allowing cross-examination and admitting the late-filed pre-trial briefs.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA reversed the RTC, holding that the RTC acted with grave abuse of discretion in allowing the petitioners to cross-examine Joaquin and to file a pre-trial brief; because the petitioners had clearly failed to show that their failure to attend the pre-trial conference and to file a pre-trial brief was due to fraud, accident, mistake or excusable neglect.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Waiver of Rights:** By failing to attend the pre-trial and submit the pre-trial brief, the petitioners risk waiving their right to present evidence and participate fully in the partition proceedings.
*   **Adverse Judgment:** A final and executory judgment in the partition action will bind the petitioners, potentially forcing a division of the property on terms unfavorable to them.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Procedure:** The CA emphasized the importance of adhering to the rules of procedure and the limited scope of liberal construction.
*   **Mootness Doctrine:** The Supreme Court ultimately *denied* the petition, holding it as moot and academic because the underlying partition case had already reached a final and executory judgment and the issue was purely procedural. Cites *Go v. Tabanda, 272-A Phil. 122, 126 (1991)* on the mootness of procedural issues after a final judgment.
*   **Exceptions to Mootness Doctrine:** The Court acknowledged exceptions to the mootness doctrine (grave constitutional violations, exceptional character, public interest, opportunity for guidance, repetition evading review), but found none applicable. Cites *Republic v. Moldex Realty, Inc., G.R. No. 171041, 10 February 2016, 783 SCRA 414, 422-423*.
*   **Justiciable Controversy:** The court reiterated the requirement of an actual controversy for the exercise of its power of adjudication. Cites *Reyes v. Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd., 731 Phil. 155, 160 (2014)*; *Sanlakas v. Executive Secretary Reyes, 466 Phil. 482, 505 (2004)*.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "excusable neglect" standard for excusing non-appearance and late filing is subjective and open to interpretation. The CA found the excuses offered by petitioners insufficient.
*   **The final and executory status of the decision on the action for partition renders the procedural questions moot.**

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition because the issue was considered moot and academic.
