**Case Summary: *Buenaventura v. Career Philippines Shipmanagement, Inc.*, G.R. No. 224127 (August 15, 2018)**

**Legal Issue:** Whether the seafarer, Benedicto Buenaventura, is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits under either the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) or the POEA-SEC.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **CBA (ITF Cruise Ship Model Agreement):** The LA and NLRC initially ruled in favor of Buenaventura based on the CBA's accident-related disability provision (Art. 10). The Supreme Court (SC) found insufficient proof of an "accident" as required by the CBA. Lack of ship log or Master's report of the incident and the LA's conclusion based on medical finding were not adequate to prove accident as a basis for disability benefits.
*   **POEA-SEC (Section 20(B)(4)):** The SC invokes POEA-SEC even in the absence of an accident compensable under CBA and analyzes the case under its provisions.
    *   **Work-Related Injury:** The SC held that even absent an accident, Buenaventura's shoulder injury ("superior labral tear") was work-related as it occurred "arising out of and in the course of employment." The court emphasized the "work-connection" concept, citing *Sy v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc.*
    *   **Disability Assessment & Third Doctor Rule (Section 20(A)(3)):** Crucially, the SC found that Buenaventura failed to comply with the mandatory third-doctor procedure outlined in Section 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC. Because the seafarer's independent medical assessment conflicted with that of the company-designated physician, the SC held that Buenaventura was obligated to seek a mutually agreed-upon third doctor, and his failure to do so rendered the company-designated physician's assessment controlling, citing *Calimlim v. Wallem Maritime Services, Inc.*
    *   **Disability Grading:** As a result of the seafarer's failure to avail of a third doctor, the company doctor's disability grades of 11 (shoulder) and 12 (neck) were upheld. The Court awarded benefits commensurate with these disability grades.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Respondents (Career Philippines Shipmanagement, Inc. and Columbia Shipmanagement Ltd.) are liable for disability benefits based on disability grades 11 and 12.
*   Petitioner (Buenaventura) failed to fulfill his obligation to undergo third-doctor evaluation as prescribed by POEA-SEC.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Definition of "Accident":** The CA originally dismissed the case due to lack of factual basis for an accident. The SC's analysis sidesteps this by focusing on the broader "work-relatedness" under the POEA-SEC.
*   **Third-Doctor Rule Application:** The strict application of the third-doctor rule in Section 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC presents a significant hurdle for seafarers disputing company-designated physician assessments. Failure to follow this procedure, even in good faith, effectively forfeits their right to a higher disability rating.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The denial of attorney's fees due to absence of bad faith on the part of the employer indicates that the issues were genuinely contested.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **POEA-SEC (Section 20(A)(3) and Section 20(B)(4))** Standard Employment Contract terms that govern this case.
*   **Sy v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc.** Defines "work-related injury" in the context of seafarer claims.
*   **Calimlim v. Wallem Maritime Services, Inc.** Reinforces the mandatory nature of the third-doctor rule in POEA-SEC.
*   **Racelis v. United Philippines Lines, Inc., et al.** States that the POEA-SEC and CBA govern the employment relationship between the seafarer and respondent.

**Conclusion:**

The SC partially reverses the CA ruling and awards disability benefits based on the company-designated physician's disability grades. The key takeaway is the strict adherence to the third-doctor procedure in the POEA-SEC when contesting medical assessments of seafarer injuries. The case highlights the importance of proper documentation and reporting of incidents on board, even if they do not initially appear to be serious accidents.
