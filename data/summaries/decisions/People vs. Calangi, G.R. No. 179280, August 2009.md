## Legal Document Summary: People v. Calangi, G.R. No. 179280

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (G.R. No. 179280) reversing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision and acquitting Pedro Calangi of rape charges in Criminal Case Nos. 6886-G and 6888-G.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Pedro Calangi was charged with two counts of rape of his daughter-in-law AAA (Crim. Cases 6886-G and 6887-G) and two counts of rape of his granddaughter BBB (Crim. Cases 6888-G and 6889-G). Charges based on incidents allegedly occurring in July 1996 (AAA) and August 1999 (BBB).
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** RTC convicted Calangi on all counts, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* for the AAA rapes and death for the BBB rapes. CA acquitted him on Crim. Cases 6887-G and 6889-G (one count of rape each for AAA and BBB, respectively) due to insufficient evidence but affirmed the convictions in Crim. Cases 6886-G and 6888-G.
*   **Defense:** Calangi interposed alibi and denied the charges.
*   **Victim Testimony Issues:**
    *   **BBB's Testimony:** Found to be vague, disjointed, and lacking essential details to establish the crime of rape. BBB could not recall critical details such as the date, year, or even feelings during the alleged rape.
    *   **AAA's Testimony:** Focused on a different alleged rape in 1986, contradicting the Information which alleged rape in 1996. Her testimony included improbabilities.
*   **Supervening Event:** Calangi died during the pendency of the appeal.

**Key Legal Issues and Rationale:**

*   **Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt:** The Supreme Court found that the prosecution failed to prove Calangi's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt due to the inconsistencies, vagueness, and improbabilities in the testimonies of the alleged victims, therefore warranting the application of the constitutionally mandated presumption of innocence. The court emphasized that although the sole testimony of a victim is enough to sustain a conviction, it must meet the test of credibility.
*   **Right to be Informed of the Nature and Cause of Accusation:** AAA's testimony focused on a purported rape in 1986, a date significantly different from the 1996 alleged in the Information. The Supreme Court held that convicting Calangi based on the 1986 incident would violate his constitutional right. *See Rule 115 (b) of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure*
*   **Medical Findings:** The medical findings of BBB's pregnancy did not establish that the pregnancy was a result of rape.
*   **Effect of Death Pending Appeal:** While Calangi's death would ordinarily result in dismissal and acquittal, the Court reviewed the case to vindicate his name, finding the appeal to be impressed with merit. *People v. Yanson-Dumancas, 378 Phil. 341, 363 (1999); People v. Bayotas, G.R. No. 102007, September 2, 1994, 236 SCRA 239*

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Extinguishment of Criminal Liability:** Calangi's death extinguished his criminal liability.
*   **Extinguishment of Civil Liability ex delicto:** Calangi's death also extinguished any civil liability arising from the crimes. *People v. Bayotas, G.R. No. 102007*
*   **Potential Risk:** Erroneous conviction in the lower courts due to reliance on problematic victim testimonies, highlighting the importance of credible and consistent evidence in rape cases.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Dates of incidents:** Significant discrepancies between the dates alleged in the Information and the testimonies of the alleged victims.
*   **Credibility of witnesses:** Assessment of the credibility of BBB's and AAA's testimonies proved decisive.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, acquitting Calangi based on the prosecution's failure to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The decision highlights the importance of credible victim testimony and adherence to due process in criminal proceedings, as well as the effect of death pending appeal.
