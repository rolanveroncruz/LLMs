Okay, here's a legal summary of the *Megaworld Globus Asia, Inc. vs. Mila S. Tanseco* case (G.R. No. 181206, October 9, 2009):

**Case:** *Megaworld Globus Asia, Inc. vs. Mila S. Tanseco*, G.R. No. 181206, October 9, 2009.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision reversing the HLURB and Office of the President's decisions. The case involves a Contract to Buy and Sell a condominium unit.

**Facts:**

*   Megaworld (Seller) and Tanseco (Buyer) entered into a Contract to Buy and Sell for a condominium unit.
*   Purchase price: P16,802,037.32, payable in installments with a balance due upon delivery.
*   Stipulated delivery date: October 31, 1998, with a 6-month grace period.
*   Tanseco paid all installments except the final balance.
*   Megaworld failed to deliver the unit by the extended deadline (April 30, 1999).
*   Megaworld sent a notice of turnover almost three years later (April 23, 2002).
*   Tanseco demanded rescission and a refund.
*   Megaworld cited the Asian financial crisis as a *force majeure* event justifying the delay.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 4 (Construction Schedule):**  Establishes the completion/delivery deadline and a 6-month grace period, barring delays due to *force majeure*. Includes a clause allowing Megaworld to withdraw and refund payments without interest if the project cannot be completed due to reasons beyond its control. *Ambiguous Clause*: "or it can only be completed at a financial loss to the SELLER," - open to broad interpretation.
*   **Reciprocal Obligations:** Megaworld's obligation to deliver and Tanseco's obligation to pay the balance are reciprocal.
*   **Implied Condition:** Buyer must be ready, willing, and able to accept delivery of the unit and tender payment of the balance, but only after the Seller performs by tendering delivery.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Megaworld's Liability:** Found liable for breach of contract due to failure to deliver the unit on time.  The Asian financial crisis was *not* considered *force majeure* as it was deemed foreseeable for a real estate company. Liable for refund of payments, interest, attorney's fees, exemplary damages, and costs.
*   **Tanseco's Liability:** Original decision found Tanseco liable for the balance due to failure to make demand for rescission; reversed on appeal.

**Legal Issues & Rulings:**

*   **Default (Mora):** Court of Appeals relied on Article 1169 of the Civil Code, holding that no demand was necessary because the contract specified a delivery date, making time of the essence. Supreme Court agreed, holding that demand would have been useless as Megaworld had already failed to deliver on time, and Tanseco was not in delay due to lack of performance by Megaworld.
*   ***Force Majeure***: Court ruled that the Asian financial crisis did not constitute *force majeure* excusing Megaworld's delay, citing *Fil-Estate Properties, Inc., v. Go* (G.R. No. 165164, August 17, 2007).
*   **Laches:**  The Court rejected Megaworld's argument that Tanseco's claim was barred by laches, emphasizing equitable considerations.
*   **Remedy:** The Supreme Court held that the proper remedy was *cancellation* of the contract, not *rescission* under Article 1191 of the Civil Code, as this was a contract to buy and sell and the suspensive condition had not occurred. Citing *Sta. Lucia Realty v. Romeo Uyecio* (G.R. No. 176217, August 13, 2008).
*   **Non-Forfeiture of Payments:**  Supreme Court cited Section 23 of PD 957, affirming Tanseco's right to reimbursement.
*   **Interest:** Interest was awarded at 6% per annum from the date of demand (May 6, 2002) and 12% per annum from the finality of the judgment, citing *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994).
*   **Exemplary Damages:** Awarded to deter real estate companies from making empty promises.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The *force majeure* clause in Section 4:**  The phrase "or it can only be completed at a financial loss to the SELLER" is overly broad and could be exploited by the developer. This clause, coupled with the "reasons beyond its control" language, creates ambiguity and could be argued to apply to various economic conditions.
*   **Interpretation of "Demand":** Megaworld's argument centered around the timing of Tanseco's demand.  This highlights the importance of clearly establishing default in such contracts.
*   **Precedent & Market Risk:** This case serves as precedent cautioning real estate developers against overpromising delivery times and relying on broadly defined *force majeure* clauses.

**Outcome:**

The Court of Appeals' decision was affirmed with modification. The Contract to Buy and Sell was cancelled. Megaworld was ordered to pay Tanseco:

*   P14,281,731.70 (total payments)
*   6% interest per annum from May 6, 2002
*   12% interest per annum from the finality of the judgment
*   P200,000 attorney's fees
*   P100,000 exemplary damages
*   Costs of suit.

**Summary for Legal Strategy:**

This case favors buyers in pre-selling condominium contracts where developers fail to deliver on time. The *force majeure* defense is difficult to sustain for events foreseeable to a real estate developer. The case underscores the developer's duty to deliver on the contracted timeline and suggests careful drafting of *force majeure* clauses. The Supreme Court affirmed that a real estate developer cannot retain funds from the buyer and the buyer is entitled to their funds back with interest under PD 957.
