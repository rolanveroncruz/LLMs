## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 97-9-278-RTC

**Nature:** Resolution on a judicial audit conducted in RTC Branches 29 and 59, Toledo City, following the retirement of Judges Delgado (Branch 29) and Roque (Branch 59).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Judge Delgado (Branch 29):**
    *   Left ten (10) cases undecided.
    *   Optional retirement approved despite lack of certification regarding pending cases, seemingly due to oversight by both Administrative Services and the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA).
*   **Atty. Bajarias (Branch Clerk of Court, Branch 29):**
    *   Failed to timely transmit records of appealed cases to the Court of Appeals. *Rule 122, Sec. 8; Rule 41, Sec. 10*.
    *   Delayed issuance of writ of execution in one case, records are incomplete.
*   **Judge Roque (Branch 59):**
    *   Failed to decide eight (8) criminal and nine (9) civil cases within the reglementary period (3 months as per *Section 15, Article VIII of the Constitution*). Three criminal cases involved detention prisoners.
    *   Actions on nineteen (19) criminal and eleven (11) civil cases were significantly delayed.
*   **Clerk of Court Marfil (Assisted Branch 59):**
    *   Assigned new docket numbers to cases in Branch 59, causing difficulty in verifying case status; potentially confusing practice not in the *Manual for Clerks of Court*
    *   Did not maintain separate docket books for Branch 59.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Bajarias:** Liable for neglect of duty for failing to promptly transmit records of appealed cases (*Ramos vs. Gregorio, A.M. P-91-600*). Obligation to transmit records within 5 days for criminal appeals and 30 days for civil appeals (*Rule 122, Sec. 8; Rule 41, Sec. 10*).
*   **Judge Roque:** Liable for gross inefficiency for failing to decide cases within the reglementary period (*Re: Judge Danilo M. Tenerife, A.M. No. 95-5-42-MTC*), violating *Canon 3, Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct*. A case is considered submitted once the memoranda are submitted or the period to submit has lapsed.
*   **Clerk of Court Marfil:** Reminded to be more circumspect in handling court records and to adhere to the Manual for Clerks of Court.

**Penalties:**

*   **Atty. Bajarias:** Fined P1,000.00.
*   **Judge Roque:** Fined P50,000.00, deducted from retirement pay.
*   **Clerk of Court Marfil:** Absolved from liability but reminded to follow established procedures.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document highlights the systemic failures in the supervision and monitoring of judges' performance and court administration.
*   The interpretation of when a case is "submitted for decision" (particularly when memoranda are allowed but not filed) could be contentious.
*   The reliance on self-reporting and certifications could lead to further issues if not thoroughly verified by the appropriate offices (OAS and OCA).
*   The fact that Judge Delgado's retirement was approved despite unresolved cases presents a risk of future similar occurrences, emphasizing the need for improved inter-office coordination and stricter adherence to established procedures.
