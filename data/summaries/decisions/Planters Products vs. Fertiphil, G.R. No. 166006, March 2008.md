## Legal Document Summary: *Planters Products, Inc. v. Fertiphil Corporation* (G.R. No. 166006)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision, holding Planters Products, Inc. (PPI) liable to Fertiphil Corporation (Fertiphil) for levies paid under Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 1465.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **LOI No. 1465:** Issued by then-President Marcos, imposing a "capital recovery component" (CRC) of P10 per bag on domestic fertilizer sales. Proceeds were to be remitted to PPI to ensure its financial viability.
*   **Fertiphil's Obligation:** Fertiphil paid the P10 levy per bag to the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA), which then remitted the funds to PPI.
*   **Fertiphil's Claim:** Fertiphil sought a refund, arguing the LOI was unconstitutional, unjust, unreasonable, oppressive, invalid, and amounted to a denial of due process.

**Court Rulings:**

*   **RTC:** Ruled in favor of Fertiphil, declaring LOI No. 1465 unconstitutional as it violated the public purpose limitation on the power of taxation. It ordered PPI to refund the amount of P6,698,144.00 to Fertiphil plus legal interest at 12%.
*   **CA:** Affirmed the RTC ruling, holding the LOI unconstitutional even if issued under the police power, as it did not promote public welfare.

**Issues and Analysis:**

1.  **Locus Standi:** The Court held that Fertiphil had locus standi because it suffered a direct injury by being forced to pay the P10 levy on each bag of fertilizer sold in the domestic market.
2.  **Jurisdiction:** The Court affirmed that RTCs have the authority to rule on the constitutionality of statutes, executive orders, and presidential decrees (Art. VIII, Sec. 5 of the 1987 Constitution).
3.  **Collateral Attack:** The Court dismissed PPI's argument that constitutionality cannot be collaterally attacked, finding that Fertiphil's complaint adequately raised the constitutional issue and that the validity of the LOI was the *lis mota* of the case.
4.  **Constitutionality of LOI No. 1465:** The Court found that LOI No. 1465 was an invalid exercise of the power of taxation because it violated the inherent limitation that taxes can only be levied for a public purpose. The law expressly benefited PPI, a private corporation, by using tax revenue to address the company's debt. Even considered under police power, it fails the "lawful means" and "lawful subjects" test by not promoting public interest.
5.  **Doctrine of Operative Fact:** The Court rejected PPI's argument for its application, stating that no undue burden would be imposed on PPI and that is was only just and equitable to return the funds as doing so would allow unjust enrichment by PPI.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Vera* (65 Phil. 56) - Discussed the "direct injury test" for locus standi in public suits.

*   *Equi-Asia Placement, Inc. v. Department of Foreign Affairs* (G.R. No. 152214) - Further reinforced RTC's jurisdiction on the constitutionality of agency rules.
*   *Tropical Homes, Inc. v. National Housing Authority* (G.R. No. L-48672) - Explains that the constitutional issue must be properly raised and that it must be necessary to a determination of the case.
*   *Edu v. Ericta* (G.R. No. L-32096) - Differentiates the power of police from the power of taxation.
*   *Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Edu* (G.R. No. L-41383) - Differentiates between taxes and regulatory fees.
*   *Lutz v. Araneta* (98 Phil. 148) - Holds that taxation may be used as an implementation of police power.
*   *Cojuangco, Jr. v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 119398) - Affirms that no issue will be entertained on appeal unless raised in the court a quo.
*   *Republic v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 79732) - States the doctrine of operative fact only applies as a matter of equity and fair play.
*   *Tan v. Barrios* (G.R. Nos. 85481-82) - States when the doctrine of operative fact applies in a criminal case.
*   *Municipality of Malabang v. Benito* (G.R. No. L-28113) - States that the doctrine of operative fact can put in limbo acts of the municipality done in reliance of a law creating it.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Art. VIII, Sec. 5, 1987 Constitution:** Grants RTCs jurisdiction over cases involving constitutionality of laws.
*   **Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 3, Sec. 2:** Defines "real party-in-interest" for determining locus standi.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 7:** States that when courts declare a law to be unconstitutional, the law shall be void and the Constitution will govern.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 22:** Provides that "every person who, through an act of performance by another comes into possession of something at the expense of the latter without just or legal ground shall return the same to him."

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **No ambiguities were mentioned.**
*   The Court rejected the application of the doctrine of operative fact, holding that because the levy was unconstitutional, it never had legal effect.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, finding LOI No. 1465 unconstitutional and ordering PPI to refund Fertiphil. The ruling firmly establishes the limits of the power of taxation and police power and the principle that public funds cannot be used for private benefit.
