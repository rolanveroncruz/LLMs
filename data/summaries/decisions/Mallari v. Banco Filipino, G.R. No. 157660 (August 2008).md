**Legal Document Summary: *Mallari v. Banco Filipino***

**Case:** Eligio P. Mallari v. Banco Filipino Savings & Mortgage Bank, G.R. No. 157660, August 29, 2008.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging CA dismissal of a Certiorari petition.

**Facts:**

*   Mallari (Petitioner) obtained a loan from Banco Filipino (Respondent) secured by a mortgage.
*   Petitioner defaulted, leading to extrajudicial foreclosure by Respondent.
*   Respondent was the highest bidder and consolidated title after Petitioner failed to redeem within the one-year period prescribed by law.
*   Respondent filed an ex-parte petition for a writ of possession under Act No. 3135.
*   Petitioner opposed, citing a pending action for nullity of the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings.
*   RTC granted the writ of possession, and the CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended):** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages.
*   **Section 7, Act No. 3135:**  Impliedly dictates the ministerial duty of the court to issue a writ of possession to the purchaser (Respondent) after consolidation of title.
*   **Section 8, Act No. 3135:**  Provides the debtor (Petitioner) a remedy to petition for the setting aside of the sale and cancellation of the writ of possession within 30 days after the purchaser is given possession, alleging non-violation of the mortgage or improper sale, and the court shall follow summary procedure under Section 112 of Act No. 496.
*  **Petitioner's Obligation:** Obligated to pay loan.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioner:** Risk of losing possession of the property due to valid foreclosure.
*   **Respondent:** Primarily, the risk of defending against the action to declare the foreclosure null and void, though successful in obtaining the writ of possession.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended):** "An Act To Regulate The Sale Of Property Under Special Powers Inserted In Or Annexed To Real Estate Mortgages."
*   **Act No. 496:** Provided for the summary procedure referenced in Section 8.
*   **Espiridion v. Court of Appeals:**  Reiterates the ministerial nature of writ of possession issuance after consolidation of title. (G.R. No. 146933, June 8, 2006)
*   **Saguan v. Philippine Bank of Communications:**  Reinforces that the duty to grant a writ of possession is ministerial. (G.R. No. 159882, November 23, 2007)
*   **Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co., Inc. v. National Wages and Productivity Commission:**  Defines requisites for certiorari as a special civil action.(G.R. No. 144322, February 6, 2007)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Legal Issues:**

*   **Pendency of Nullity Action:**  Petitioner's argument hinges on the alleged nullity of the foreclosure. While a pending action for annulment doesn't automatically prevent the issuance of the writ, successful annulment *would* retroactively invalidate the foreclosure and potentially require restitution. This action for nullity is the heart of the dispute.
*   **Propriety of Certiorari:** The Court found that appeal was the adequate remedy, as described in Section 8 of Act 3135, making certiorari improper.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *denied* Mallari's petition.  The CA correctly held that the RTC's issuance of the writ of possession was a ministerial duty.  The pending nullity action is not a bar to the writ.  Appeal, per Act No. 3135, was the appropriate remedy.

**Analysis for a Lawyer:**

This case reaffirms the established procedure for extrajudicial foreclosure under Act No. 3135. While the Petitioner's action for nullity of foreclosure is separate from the writ of possession, advise client to diligently pursue the nullity action. Section 8 of Act 3135 provides recourse for the debtor who contests the validity of the foreclosure sale and writ of possession.
