## Legal Document Summary: Wong v. City of Iloilo

**Case:** *Spouses Francisco and Betty Wong and Spouses Joaquin and Lolita Wong vs. City of Iloilo, et al.* G.R. No. 161748, July 03, 2009

**Subject Matter:** Validity of a tax sale of real property.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Property:** 184-sqm property in Iloilo City, originally owned by Hodges spouses, sold to Vicente Chan (unregistered), then to Wongs (petitioners, adverse claim annotated).
*   **Tax Delinquency & Sale:** City of Iloilo initiated tax sale due to delinquency. Notice sent to Hodges' estates (returned as undeliverable). Melanie Uy (respondent) was the highest bidder and acquired title.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:** Wongs (petitioners) sought annulment of the tax sale, alleging lack of notice as required by Section 73 of PD 464 (Real Property Tax Code), which mandates notice to the delinquent taxpayer.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** The city argues the petitioners were not registered owners and therefore not entitled to notice.

**Obligations:**

*   **City Treasurer:** Obligated under Section 73 of PD 464 to provide notice of tax sale to the "delinquent taxpayer."
*   **Taxpayer:** Obligated to pay real property taxes to avoid delinquency and potential tax sale.

**Liabilities:**

*   **If tax sale is deemed invalid:** City potentially liable to reimburse the purchaser (Melanie Uy).
*   **If tax sale is deemed valid:** Petitioners lose their claim to the property.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Notice Requirement & Definition of "Delinquent Taxpayer":** The central contention is whether Wongs, as holders of an unregistered interest with an adverse claim, qualify as "delinquent taxpayers" entitled to notice under Section 73 of PD 464. The CA ruled negatively, stating only registered owners were entitled to notice.
*   **Compliance with PD 464 Sec 73**: Notice to proper parties is critical to a tax sale validity.
*   **Jurisdictional Issue: Deposit Requirement (Section 83 PD 464 / Section 267 Local Government Code):** A key issue is the RTC's jurisdiction, specifically the petitioners' failure to deposit the sale price plus interest as required by Section 83 of PD 464 (now Section 267 of the Local Government Code). This deposit is argued to be a jurisdictional prerequisite.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **National Housing Authority v. Iloilo City (G.R. No. 172267, 20 August 2008):**  Cited to support the argument that the deposit requirement under Section 267 of the Local Government Code is jurisdictional. This precedent heavily influenced the Supreme Court's denial of the petition.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 464 (Real Property Tax Code):** Specifically Sections 73 (notice of sale) and 83 (suits assailing validity).
*   **Local Government Code:** Section 267 (action assailing validity of tax sale).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "delinquent taxpayer" under Section 73 of PD 464 and whether it encompasses parties with unregistered interests like the Wongs.
*   Application of Section 83 PD 464: Whether the payment into court is a pre-requisite to questioning a tax sale.

**Supreme Court Decision:**

The Supreme Court DENIED the petition, affirming the CA decision and upholding the validity of the tax sale because the petitioners failed to deposit the sale price plus interest, a jurisdictional requirement under Section 83 of PD 464 (and Section 267 of the Local Government Code). The tax sale was never validly challenged.
