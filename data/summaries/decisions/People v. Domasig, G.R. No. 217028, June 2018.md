## Legal Document Summary: People v. Domasig, G.R. No. 217028

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for Robbery with Homicide under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) *partially granted* the appeal, setting aside the CA decision. The SC *downgraded* the conviction to *Homicide* and modified the penalty and damages.

**Facts:**

*   Accused-appellant (Domasig) was charged with Robbery with Homicide for allegedly robbing and stabbing a 14-year-old victim (AAA).
*   Eyewitness (Gloriana) testified to seeing Domasig stabbing the victim after leaving him to defecate.
*   The RTC found Domasig guilty of Robbery with Homicide based on Gloriana's testimony.
*   The CA affirmed the conviction with a modification regarding interest on damages.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 294(1), RPC (Robbery with Homicide):** Requires proof of (a) taking personal property with violence/intimidation, (b) property belonging to another, (c) intent to gain (animus lucrandi), and (d) homicide committed by reason or on occasion of the robbery.
*   **Prosecution Burden:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving *beyond reasonable doubt* all elements of Robbery with Homicide.  Crucially, they must establish the intent to rob *preceded* the killing (People v. Palma, 754 Phil. 371, 378 (2015)).  The robbery itself must be proven as conclusively as any other element (People v. Orias, 636 Phil. 427, 442 (2010)).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Initially:** Convicted of Robbery with Homicide.
*   **SC Decision:** Convicted of Homicide. Sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of six (6) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor* to seventeen (17) years of *reclusion temporal*. Ordered to pay P50,000 civil indemnity and P50,000 moral damages to the victim's heirs. 6% interest per annum from finality of the decision.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence for Robbery:** The SC found the prosecution's evidence *insufficient* to prove the "taking" element of robbery. Gloriana did not witness the taking, and the victim having money and the accused stealing it was considered speculation.
*   **Intent to Rob vs. Intent to Kill:** The SC emphasized the prosecution's failure to prove Domasig's *intent to rob* before the killing occurred. The lack of evidence connecting the alleged robbery to the homicide was fatal to the Robbery with Homicide charge.
*   **Qualifying Circumstances for Murder:** The Information must clearly allege circumstances that would raise the charge to murder.
*   **Alibi Defence:** Note the impact of a weak alibi, particularly the failure to present corroborating witnesses to support Domasig's claim of being at a Bingo hall.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 294(1):** Defines Robbery with Homicide.
*   **People v. Beriber, 693 Phil. 629, 640-641 (2012):**  Elements of Robbery with Homicide.
*   **People v. Palma, 754 Phil. 371, 378 (2015):** Intent to rob must precede killing.
*   **People v. Orias, 636 Phil. 427, 442 (2010):**  Robbery must be proven conclusively.
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806, 852 (2016):** Regarding civil indemnity and moral damages.
*   **Espino v. People, 713 Phil. 377, 384 (2013):** Nature of crime determined by facts in the information.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contentious issue is the lack of concrete evidence directly linking the homicide to a prior or simultaneous robbery.

**Overall Analysis:**

The SC overturned the Robbery with Homicide conviction because the prosecution failed to adequately prove the robbery element, specifically the "taking" and the intent to rob. The single eyewitness testimony was deemed insufficient to establish the crime of Robbery with Homicide beyond reasonable doubt.  The SC correctly downgraded the conviction to Homicide, based on the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the killing. This case underscores the importance of establishing *all* elements of a crime beyond reasonable doubt, particularly the element of intent.
