**Case Summary: *John Dy v. People of the Philippines***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 158312, November 14, 2008

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's conviction of John Dy for two counts of Estafa (Art. 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code) and two counts of violation of B.P. Blg. 22.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Estafa (Art. 315, par. 2(d)):**
    *   Elements: Postdating/issuing a check for an obligation contracted *at the time of issuance*, insufficiency of funds, and damage to payee are present.
    *   *Issue* of blank checks: Valid if delivered to payee (W.L. Foods) who then has prima facie authority to fill in blanks (Sec. 14, Negotiable Instruments Law). Burden on Dy to prove lack of authority, which he failed to do.
    *   *Deceit*: Court finds *prima facie* evidence of deceit established only for FEBTC Check No. 553615 (P226,794.36) due to dishonor for *insufficiency of funds* and failure to cover it after notice (letter of counsel dated November 10, 1992).
    *   Prior business relationship not a bar, as each transaction is separate.
    *   Absent proof of good faith in attempting to pay, Dy is guilty of estafa for dishonored check FEBTC Check No. 553615, however is acquitted from liability of Estafa for FEBTC Check No. 553602 (P106,579.60).

*   **B.P. Blg. 22:**
    *   Elements: Making/issuing a check for value, knowledge of insufficient funds at the time of issue, subsequent dishonor.
    *   Blank checks: Issuance still punishable under B.P. Blg. 22; *malum prohibitum*, focus is on act of issuing bad check. Non-fulfillment of obligation is immaterial.
    *   Notice: Dy, as sole signatory and proprietor, received notice of dishonor.
    *   Held liable for B.P. Blg. 22 violation (FEBTC Check No. 553615) as he failed to pay or make arrangements with bank after dishonor due to *insufficiency of funds* and for issuing stop payment order. But is acquitted for issuing FEBTC Check No. 553602

*   **Uncollected Deposits vs. Insufficient Funds:** Critical distinction. Check No. 553602 dishonored for "drawn against uncollected deposit" (DAUD), not insufficiency of funds.  Court states uncollected deposits do not fall under Estafa and B.P. Blg 22. Criminal laws construed strictly against the government.

*   **Civil Liability:** Sustained appellate court's award of damages to W.L. Foods for *both* checks despite acquittal on one Estafa and B.P. Blg 22 charges.  Civil liability proven by preponderance of evidence, distinct from criminal standard.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Blank Check Authority:** Could be challenged on grounds of lack of express authorization for *specific amounts*, even though N.I.L. presumes authority. Focus will be on W.L. Foods' internal controls and accounting practices.
*   **Uncollected Deposits:** The acquittal regarding Check No. 553602 hinges on the "DAUD" dishonor. This is open to interpretation.
*   **Double Recovery?:** Civil liability is imposed for both checks despite the acquittal on one set of criminal charges. This raises the question of whether W.L. Foods is receiving unjust enrichment.

**Case Law References:**

*   *People v. Romero* (Estafa elements)
*   *De la Victoria v. Burgos* (Definition of "issue" and delivery)
*   *Navarro v. Court of Appeals* (B.P. Blg. 22 elements)
*   *Cruz v. Court of Appeals* (B.P. Blg. 22 intent immaterial)
* *Dingle v. Intermediate Appellate Court* (Notice of Dishonor)
* *Lao v. Court of Appeals* (Notice of Dishonor)

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 315, par. 2(d) (Estafa)
*   Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (Bouncing Check Law)
*   Negotiable Instruments Law, Sec. 14 (Blank Instruments), Sec. 191 (Definition of Issue)

**Conclusion:**

The case presents a mixed outcome. Dy is acquitted on some charges due to a technicality (DAUD vs. insufficiency). He remains liable for one count each of estafa and B.P. Blg. 22, as well as civil damages for the entire debt. A strong argument could be made regarding excessive civil damages in lieu of the acquittal.
