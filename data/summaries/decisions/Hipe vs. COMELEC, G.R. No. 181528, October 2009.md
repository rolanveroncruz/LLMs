**Case Summary: *Hipe v. COMELEC & Vicencio*, G.R. No. 181528 (2009)**

**Nature of Document:** Decision on Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition challenging a COMELEC En Banc Resolution affirming the exclusion of election returns in a mayoral election.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Hector T. Hipe (Mayoralty Candidate)
*   **Respondents:** COMELEC, Ma. Cristina L. Vicencio (Mayoralty Candidate)

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Election Contest:** May 14, 2007 mayoral election in Catubig, Northern Samar.
*   **Exclusion of Election Returns:** Vicencio successfully petitioned the MBOC to exclude seven election returns (Precinct Nos. 0037B, 0052A, 0053A, 0058A, 0080A, 0081A, 0082A) due to alleged duress, threats, intimidation, coercion, and vote buying.
*   **MBOC Ruling:** Granted Vicencio's petition to exclude the returns on May 19, 2007.
*   **Hipe's Appeal:** Hipe appealed to COMELEC. The COMELEC Second Division initially dismissed the appeal as being filed out of time. The COMELEC En Banc affirmed the dismissal and upheld the exclusion.
*   **Proclamation:** Vicencio was proclaimed mayor on July 17, 2007.

**Issue:** Whether COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the exclusion of the election returns and dismissing Hipe's appeal as untimely.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court **partially granted** Hipe's petition.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** The Court found COMELEC erred in dismissing Hipe's appeal as untimely. The Court found Hipe had presented substantial evidence that the written ruling of the MBOC was not properly served to him or his counsel. The Court reminded the COMELEC that it has the discretion to construe its rules liberally to achieve its purpose - to effectuate and safeguard the will of the electorate.
*   **Validity of Exclusion:** However, the Court **affirmed** the COMELEC's finding that the exclusion of the seven election returns was valid and supported by the evidence (affidavits of Board of Election Inspectors indicating duress, etc.). The court deferred to the COMELEC's factual findings as binding unless unsupported by any evidence (citing *Dagloc v. COMELEC*).

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **COMELEC's Obligation:** To fairly and accurately ascertain election results based on untampered returns (citing *Cauton v. COMELEC*), balancing procedural rules with the need to effectuate the electorate's will.
*   **Hipe's Liability:** Ultimately, Hipe is bound by the COMELEC's finding of irregularities in the excluded returns, despite the procedural error regarding the appeal.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Findings of COMELEC:** The Court deferred to the COMELEC's factual findings regarding irregularities. The court must determine if this deference is appropriate, as the COMELEC's fact-finding process may have been tainted by the initial procedural error.
*   **"Substantial Compliance":** The court’s acceptance of Vicencio’s submission of supporting documents the day after filing written objections as “substantial compliance” could set a potentially problematic precedent if not carefully considered.
*   **Recanted Testimony:** The COMELEC's reliance on a witness's recanted testimony as further support for their findings raises concerns about the reliability of the evidence. The original testimony, under oath, should be carefully scrutinized.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 64 & 65, Rules of Court:** Basis for the petition for certiorari and prohibition.
*   **Sec. 20(d) of R.A. No. 7166:** Requirement for MBOC's written ruling.
*   **Rule 131, Sec. 3(m), Rules of Court:** Presumption of regularity in official duty.
*   **Evidence Rule (Burden of Proof)**: Where a party asserts a negative fact, the party has the burden of proof that he was not furnished with a copy of the written ruling.
*   **Dagloc v. COMELEC:** Deference to COMELEC's factual findings.
*   **Cauton v. COMELEC:** Object of canvass is to determine results based on official election returns.
*   **Marabur v. COMELEC:** "Substantial Compliance" in an election protest.

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The determination of whether the MBOC ruling was actually received by Hipe or his counsel is crucial for determining the timeliness of the appeal.
*   The affidavits of the Board of Election Inspectors, presented to establish duress, threats, and intimidation.

**Actionable Items:**

*   Analyze the evidence supporting the exclusion of the election returns to determine if there was "substantial evidence" to support the COMELEC's findings.
*   Evaluate the impact of COMELEC’s initial error regarding the timeliness of the appeal on the fairness and objectivity of its subsequent factual findings.
*   Research case law on the treatment of recanted testimony and determine its impact on the admissibility and weight of evidence.
