**Legal Document Summary: *Lopez v. Court of Appeals and Primex Corporation***

**Case:** G.R. No. 163959 & 177855, August 1, 2018 (383 Phil. 1)

**Nature of Document:** Resolution of the Supreme Court resolving consolidated appeals concerning a land sale dispute.

**Parties:**
*   Petitioners: Marcelino E. Lopez, et al. (Heirs of Marcelino Lopez)
*   Respondents: Court of Appeals and Primex Corporation

**Key Issue 1: Validity of Compromise Agreement**

*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court declared a Compromise Agreement void due to the death of Marcelino Lopez prior to its execution.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   Agency is extinguished by the death of the principal (Art. 1919, Civil Code).
    *   Atty. Sergio Angeles, acting as agent for the Lopezes, entered into the Compromise Agreement after Marcelino Lopez's death, rendering his authority (based on the special power of attorney) *functus officio*.
    *   Any act by the agent subsequent to the principal's death is *void ab initio*, unless exceptions under Art. 1930 and 1931 of the Civil Code apply (Rallos v. Felix Go Chan & Sons Realty Corporation, G.R. No. L-24332, January 31, 1978). The Court did not find these exceptions applicable.
*   **Risk:**  The Compromise Agreement is unenforceable against the heirs of Marcelino Lopez. Atty. Angeles' failure to disclose the death of his client raises ethical concerns and possible liability.

**Key Issue 2: Finality of CA Decision**

*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision of January 23, 2007 because the Lopezes' Motion for Reconsideration was filed out of time.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   The petitioners were represented by two attorneys, Atty. Sergio Angeles and Atty. Martin Pantaleon. Notice to either counsel is considered notice to the client.
    *   Atty. Pantaleon received the CA's decision on January 30, 2007, triggering the 15-day period for filing a motion for reconsideration (or appeal).
    *   The Motion for Reconsideration, filed on March 6, 2007, was beyond the deadline and therefore did not toll the period to appeal making the original CA decision final and executory.
*   **Statutory Reference:** Section 2, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court (service upon counsel).
*   **Risk:** The petitioners lost their right to appeal the CA decision due to the late filing of the Motion for Reconsideration.

**Overall Outcome:**

1.  The Compromise Agreement is void.
2.  The March 7, 2012 resolution granting the Joint Motion to Dismiss and Withdrawal of Petition is set aside.
3.  The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appealsâ€™ judgment ordering Primex to pay the full balance of the purchase price plus 6% legal interest.

**Potential Areas of Concern:**

*   **Atty. Angeles' Conduct:** The resolution highlights concerns over Atty. Angeles' actions, particularly his failure to inform the Court of Marcelino Lopez's death and his execution of the Compromise Agreement without valid authority. This could lead to disciplinary action.
*   **Enforcement of Judgment:** Despite the voided compromise agreement, the underlying CA decision stands, ordering Primex to pay the balance. Enforcement may still present complications given the protracted history and potential disputes over the precise amount due.
*   **Ambiguity in the Scope of Agency:**  The document hinges on the scope and termination of agency. A careful examination of the original power of attorney and its wording is crucial.
