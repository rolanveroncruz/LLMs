Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in Markdown.

**Case:** *Sps. Elizabeth S. Tagle & Ernesto R. Tagle vs. Hon. Court of Appeals, RTC, Quezon City, Branch 97, Sps. Federico and Rosamyrna Carandang and Sheriff Carol Bulacan* G.R. NO. 162738, July 08, 2009

**Summary:**

This case involves a petition for certiorari by the Tagles (petitioners) challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision upholding the RTC's orders that validated public auctions of their properties. The core issue stems from the execution of a judgment in favor of the Carandangs (respondents) in a rescission of contract case. The Tagles allege irregularities in the auction process, specifically lack of proper notice and grossly inadequate sale prices. The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately denied the Tagles' petition.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Assignment:**  The central agreement. The Tagles assumed the Carandangs' right to repurchase a property from Philippine Banking Corporation (PBC). The Tagles then acquired the property directly from PBC, triggering the rescission claim by the Carandangs for non-payment under the Deed of Assignment.
*   **Judgment Obligation:** The CA ordered the Tagles to pay the Carandangs P445,115.04 plus legal interest from the filing of the complaint. This judgment became final and executory.
*   **Rule 39, Section 15 (Rules of Civil Procedure):**  Governs notice requirements for execution sales. The Tagles argued they didn't receive proper written notice of the auctions. The SC interpreted this in relation to Rule 13, Section 6.
*   **Duty to Prove Inadequacy of Price:**  The Tagles had the burden of proving that the auction prices were grossly inadequate.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Tagles' Debt to Carandangs:**  The principal liability is the monetary judgment affirmed by the SC.
*   **Potential Liability for Deficiency:** If the proceeds from the execution sales did not fully satisfy the judgment debt, the Tagles would remain liable for the deficiency.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Notice of Sale (Rule 39, Sec. 15 vs. Rule 13, Sec. 6):** The dispute over whether notice was properly served. The SC's interpretation of "written notice" not requiring *personal* service on the judgment debtor is key.  *The core contentious point is whether service on the secretary constitutes sufficient notice under the rules.*
*   **Inadequacy of Price:** The Tagles failed to provide sufficient evidence of the true value of the artworks sold.  *A key risk for the Tagles was their inability to demonstrate "gross inadequacy" of the price, a standard often requiring evidence of fraud or other unfairness in the sale itself.*
*   **Sheriff's Report:** The court gave credence to the Sheriff's Report, presuming regularity in its performance.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 15 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Notice of Sale of property on execution
*   **Rule 13, Section 6 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Personal service.
*   **Rule 131, Section 3(m) :** Presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Written Notice":** Interpretation of what constitutes sufficient "written notice" under Rule 39, Sec. 15, particularly the latitude afforded by Rule 13, Sec. 6. This is the most contentious point and hinges on whether service on the Tagles' secretary was sufficient.
*   **Burden of Proof for "Gross Inadequacy":** While the Tagles alleged gross inadequacy, they failed to provide compelling evidence.

**Legal Analysis & Considerations for Lawyer:**

*   The SC's decision hinged significantly on procedural matters (notice) and the evidentiary burden (proving inadequate price).
*   The fact that the Tagles' son attended the auction was damaging to their claim of lack of notice.
*   Challenge to the regularity of the Sheriff's report is needed to refute.
*   Focus should be placed on challenging the Sheriff's execution and conduct of sale.
*   The outcome reinforces the principle that judgments must be executed, and the courts will generally uphold the validity of execution sales absent compelling evidence of irregularity or unfairness.
*   The lack of expert valuation significantly undermined the Tagles' case.

This summary should provide a lawyer with the crucial information needed to quickly grasp the key elements of this case.
