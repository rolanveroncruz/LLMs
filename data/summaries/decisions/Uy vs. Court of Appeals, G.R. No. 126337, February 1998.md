## Legal Document Summary: *Uy v. Court of Appeals, Civil Service Commission, and Millana* (G.R. No. 126337)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Civil Service Commission (CSC) decision regarding an illegal termination and reinstatement dispute.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Uy was promoted to Supervising Mechanical Engineer in 1982.
*   In 1988, a reorganization by Governor Paredes led to Uy's termination while Millana (a Mechanical Engineer two steps below Uy) was retained.
*   Uy filed a complaint with the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB), CSC, challenging his termination.
*   While the case was pending, the Equipment Pool Division was reorganized into the Motor Pool Division. Uy's former position was abolished, and Millana was appointed to the upgraded position of Chief of Division.
*   RA 6758 (Salary Standardization Law) took effect in 1989, reclassifying positions. Millana became Head Mechanical Engineer (Engineer IV).
*   In 1993, MSPB declared Uy's termination illegal and ordered his reinstatement.
*   Uy was initially reinstated as Engineer IV by Governor Plaza, revoking Millana's appointment.
*   Millana appealed to the CSC, challenging his termination as Engineer IV.
*   The CSC (Resolution No. 95-2104) granted Millana's appeal, ordering his reinstatement as Engineer IV and directing Uy's reinstatement to a comparable position.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Illegal Termination and Reinstatement:** MSPB's initial ruling found Uy's termination illegal and mandated reinstatement.
*   **Security of Tenure:** Millana's appointment as Head Mechanical Engineer/Engineer IV was recognized by the CSC based on his status as a permanent employee entitled to security of tenure.
*   **Reorganization:** The reorganization of the Equipment Pool Division and subsequent abolition of Uy's position were central to the dispute.
*   **RA 6758 (Salary Standardization Law):** This law triggered the reclassification of positions, affecting the ranks and designations of both Uy and Millana.
*   **CSC Resolution No. 95-2104:** The central point of contention is the CSC's order to reinstate Millana to Engineer IV and Uy to a "comparable" position, implying Uy could not directly replace Millana.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Provincial Government of Agusan del Sur:** Initially liable for illegal termination, later for failure to comply with MSPB orders, and ultimately directed to reinstate both Uy and Millana. The liability included back salaries and benefits to Millana for the period he was out of service.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **"Comparable Position":** The phrase "position comparable with that which he was holding at the time of his illegal termination" is ambiguous and subject to interpretation, potentially leading to further disputes regarding Uy's proper reinstatement.
*   **Discretion of Appointing Authority:** The Court of Appeals (and cited case law like *Panis v. CSC*) recognized the broad discretion of the appointing authority (the Governor) in personnel appointments, potentially limiting the CSC's power to dictate specific placements.
*   **Procedural Issue (Motion for Reconsideration):** The Supreme Court's decision hinged primarily on the procedural failure of Uy's counsel to file a timely motion for reconsideration in the Court of Appeals, rendering the CA decision final and executory. This overshadowed the substantive issues.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6758 (Salary Standardization Law):** Crucial for understanding the reclassification of positions.
*   **1987 Administrative Code:** Referenced in the contempt charge against Governor Plaza.
*   ***Panis v. CSC, Mendenilla v. CSC, Central Bank v. CSC, Rimonte v. CSC, Lapinid v. CSC:***  Cited by the Court of Appeals regarding the discretion of the appointing authority.  These cases suggest the Governor has broad authority in appointments as long as minimum qualifications are met, but that discretion can't be used to arbitrarily remove tenured employees.
*   ***Habaluyas Enterprises v. Japzon, Lacsamana v. Second Special Cases Division of the Intermediate Appellate Court, Rolloque v. Court of Appeals, Caltex (Phil), Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court:***  Cited by the Supreme Court regarding the strict prohibition against motions for extension of time to file motions for reconsideration.
*   ***Azores vs. Securities and Exchange Commission*** Cites that failure to perfect appeal within a period fixed by law renders the decision final

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity in the CSC Resolution No. 95-2104, ordering the reinstatement of Uy to a "comparable" position

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately denied Uy's petition based on a procedural error (failure to file a timely motion for reconsideration).  The CA's ruling, therefore, stands, requiring Millana's reinstatement as Engineer IV and Uy's reinstatement to a comparable position.  The key unresolved issue is the definition and determination of what constitutes a "comparable position" for Uy.  The case highlights the interplay between security of tenure, the appointing authority's discretion, and the impact of reorganization and salary standardization laws.
