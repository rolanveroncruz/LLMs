**Case Summary: *Bautista v. Mercado*, G.R. No. 174405, August 26, 2008 (Estafa under Article 315, par. 1(b) RPC)**

**Legal Issue:**  Whether Flora Bautista (Petitioner) is guilty of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code for misappropriating loan proceeds obtained using Felicidad Castillo Mercado's (Respondent) land title as collateral.

**Facts:**

*   Respondent gave Petitioner a TCT and executed a Special Power of Attorney (SPA), authorizing the Petitioner to mortgage Respondent's land.
*   The agreement was that Petitioner would use the land as collateral for a loan and turn over the proceeds to the Respondent for a piggery business venture.
*   Petitioner obtained a P100,000 loan, but misappropriated the funds for her own use, rather than turning them over to the Respondent.
*   The property was foreclosed by the bank (Feati Bank).
*   The lower courts found the Petitioner guilty of Estafa, and this appeal followed.

**Key Provisions & Elements of Estafa:**

*   **Article 315, par. 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines Estafa as defrauding another with unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence by misappropriating or converting money/property received in trust, on commission, for administration, or under any other obligation involving the duty to deliver or return.
*   **Elements of Estafa (Art. 315, par. 1(b)):**
    1.  Receipt of money/property in trust/commission/administration/obligation to deliver/return.
    2.  Misappropriation/conversion/denial of receipt.
    3.  Prejudice to another.
    4.  Demand for return.
*   **Case Law:** Elements of Estafa cited from *Salazar v. People*, G.R. No. 149472, 18 August 2004 and *Serona v. Court of Appeals*, 440 Phil. 508 (2002).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** Petitioner had a fiduciary duty to deliver the loan proceeds to the Respondent. The Court found that the Petitioner received the TCTs in trust, and breached this duty.
*   **Criminal Liability:**  Guilty of Estafa.
*   **Civil Liability:** Ordered to indemnify the Respondent P100,000 as actual damages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Petitioner's Defense:**  Petitioner claimed the loan was for her personal benefit and that she had no obligation to account for the proceeds. This defense was rejected by the Court based on the established fiduciary relationship.
*   **Lack of Written Agreement:** While Petitioner argued the absence of a formal written agreement outlining the business partnership, the Court gave weight to the testimonies establishing the agreement to remit proceeds, thus disproving the element.
*   **Penalty Calculation:** The court applied Article 315 and Article 65 of the RPC, as well as the Indeterminate Sentence Law, to determine the penalty, considering the amount defrauded (P100,000).
*   **Dissent:** Justice Reyes dissented on the penalty, referencing *Pao v. Temporada*, pending en banc. This dissent suggests a potential point of contention regarding the application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law in Estafa cases with amounts exceeding the base threshold.

**Ambiguities:** None apparent. The court found the evidence of the agreement and the breach of trust to be clear and convincing.

**Summary of Holdings:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding the Petitioner guilty of Estafa and ordering her to pay P100,000 in damages. The Court held that all the elements of Estafa were proven beyond reasonable doubt.
