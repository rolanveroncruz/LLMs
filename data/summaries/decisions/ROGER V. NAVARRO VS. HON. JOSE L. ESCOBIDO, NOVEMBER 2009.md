**Case Summary: Navarro v. Escobido & Go (G.R. No. 153788)**

This case involves a petition for review on certiorari challenging the CA's affirmation of the RTC's denial of Navarro's motion to dismiss two consolidated complaints for replevin and/or sum of money filed by Karen Go, dba Kargo Enterprises, against Navarro. The complaints stemmed from Lease Agreements with Option to Purchase, where Kargo Enterprises (represented by Glenn Go, Karen's husband) leased vehicles to Navarro, who allegedly defaulted on rental payments.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Cause of Action/Real Party in Interest:** Navarro argued that the complaints failed to state a cause of action because Karen Go was not a party to the Lease Agreements, only Glenn Go was. He argued that Karen Go wasn't the real party in interest.
*   **Kargo Enterprises' Nature:** Navarro contended Kargo Enterprises lacked juridical personality to sue directly, and since the agreement was with Glenn Go, Karen couldn't sue independently.
*   **Spouses as Parties (Rule 3, Section 4):** The RTC initially dismissed the case for lack of cause of action, but reconsidered, ordering Karen Go to include Glenn Go as co-plaintiff, based on the presumption the leasing business was conjugal property. Navarro argued this was improper, as a complaint without cause of action can't be remedied by amendment.
*   **Nature of Property (Paraphernal vs. Conjugal):** Navarro claimed the vehicles and Kargo Enterprises were Karen Go's paraphernal property (owned separately), so Glenn Go's inclusion as co-plaintiff was erroneous.
*   **Prior Demand:** Navarro argued the replevin actions were premature due to lack of prior demand.
*   **Replevin (Rule 60):** Navarro argued that the writs of replevin were improperly issued based on the flawed complaints, thus vehicles were illegally seized.

**Court's Holding & Rationale:**

*   **Karen Go as Real Party in Interest:** The Supreme Court held that Karen Go, as the registered owner of Kargo Enterprises, was indeed the real party in interest, as defined by Rule 3, Section 2 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. Citing *Juasing Hardware v. Mendoza*, the Court stated that the suit should be filed in the name of the owner.
*   **Kargo Enterprises as Conjugal Property:** The Court presumed Kargo Enterprises and the vehicles to be conjugal property under Article 116 of the Family Code, placing the burden of proof on Navarro to prove otherwise. Citing *Castro v. Miat*, the presumption is that all property acquired during the marriage is conjugal unless proven otherwise.
*   **Article 124 of the Family Code:** The Court cited Article 124 of the Family Code, allowing either spouse to act in managing conjugal property (Kargo Enterprises). This means either Karen or Glenn can seek possession of these properties without necessarily obtaining the other's consent.
*   **Co-Ownership & Action for Recovery of Property:** Citing *Carandang v. Heirs of De Guzman*, the Court analogized the situation to co-ownership, where any co-owner can bring an action to recover co-owned property. This means Karen can sue without Glenn's indispensable participation (though including him is proper).
*   **Non-Joinder of Parties (Rule 3, Section 11):** Citing *Macababbad v. Masirag*, the court held that failure to include Glenn Go as co-plaintiff wasn't grounds to dismiss the action. The RTC properly directed Karen Go to include her husband as a party plaintiff to begin with.
*   **Demand Not Required:** The court held there's no legal requirement for prior demand before filing a replevin action under Rule 60. Additionally, Navarro already admitted receiving demand letters.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Liability for Rental Payments:** Navarro remains liable for the unpaid rental payments under the Lease Agreements, as the underlying contractual obligation was not extinguished.
*   **Potential Damages:** Navarro could be liable for damages to Karen Go and/or Kargo Enterprises due to the breach of the Lease Agreements.
*   **Risk of Adverse Judgment:** Navarro faces the risk of an adverse judgment requiring him to pay the unpaid rentals, return the vehicles (if still recoverable), and pay damages and costs.
*   **Spousal Consent:** Lack of spousal consent could come into play if Kargo enterprises decides to take actions that would be considered as an alienation/encumbrance of property.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Rules of Court (Rules 3, 60, 11).
*   Family Code (Articles 116, 124).
*   Civil Code (Article 160).
*   *Juasing Hardware v. Mendoza* (201 Phil. 369).

*   *Carandang v. Heirs of De Guzman* (G.R. No. 160347).
*   *Macababbad v. Masirag* (G.R. No. 161237).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main contention revolves around the interpretation of the lease agreements in relation to sole proprietorships, conjugal property, and procedural rules on parties.
*   While the court ruled that it's conjugal property, further proof in a lower court would be needed.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions, finding that Karen Go was the real party in interest and that the complaints stated a cause of action. It highlighted the presumptions surrounding conjugal property and the rules on co-ownership, emphasizing that either spouse can act on behalf of the conjugal partnership.
