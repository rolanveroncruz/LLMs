**Case:** *United Coconut Planters Bank v. Atty. Lauro G. Noel*, A.C. No. 3951, June 19, 2018

**Summary:** This is a disciplinary action against Atty. Lauro Noel for violating the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility arising from his handling of an injunction case filed against United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB).  Atty. Noel failed to file a comment on the application for preliminary injunction and an answer for UCPB, resulting in a default judgment against the bank.  He repeatedly assured UCPB he would address the issue but took no action, ultimately leading to enforcement of the writ of execution against UCPB's assets.  Further, Atty. Noel repeatedly ignored orders from the Supreme Court (SC) to comment on the disbarment complaint, resulting in fines, contempt charges, and eventual detention.

**Key Provisions & Violations:**

*   **Canon 17 & 18, Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):** Failure to serve client (UCPB) with competence and diligence. Neglect of a legal matter entrusted to him, rendering him liable under Rule 18.03.
*   **Canon 12, CPR & Rule 12.03:** Failure to assist in speedy and efficient administration of justice due to repeated delays and non-compliance with court orders.
*   **Lawyer's Oath:** Violated by neglecting client interests, disregarding court orders, and exhibiting unprofessional conduct.
*   **Section 27, Rule 138, Rules of Court:** Grounds for suspension or disbarment due to gross misconduct and willful disobedience of lawful orders of a superior court.
*   **Contempt of Court:** Repeated failures to comply with SC resolutions to comment on the disbarment complaint.

**Obligations:**

*   Atty. Noel had a duty to file pleadings, protect his client's interests, and respond to the Court's orders.  He repeatedly failed to meet these obligations.

**Liabilities:**

*   Subject to disciplinary action by the SC for violation of CPR and Rules of Court.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The decision relies heavily on Atty. Noel's repeated failure to respond to the Court's orders to comment on the complaint.  A possible defense might be that he never received proper notice, although the Court's record appears to show that he did.
*   The 25 year delay in adjudication, while largely attributable to Atty. Noel's actions, could be argued as mitigating circumstance in a petition for reconsideration.

**Case Law:**

*   **Santiago v. Atty. Fojas, 318 Phil. 79 (1995):**  Reiterates a lawyer's duty to the client, court, and legal profession.
*   **Sebastian v. Atty. Bajar, 559 Phil. 211 (2007):**  Similar case involving a lawyer's willful disobedience of court orders leading to suspension.  Cited as a precedent for applying a similar penalty.
*   **Bernal Jr. v. Fernandez:** Failure to comply with the Court's directive to comment on a letter-complaint constitutes gross misconduct and insubordination, or disrespect.
*   **Cuizon v. Macalino:** A lawyer's failure to comply with the Court's Resolutions requiring him to file his comment was one of the infractions that merited his disbarment.
*   **Figueras, et al. v. Atty. Jimenez, 729 Phil. 101 (2014).** The penalties for a lawyer's failure to file a brief or other pleading range from reprimand, warning with fine, suspension and, in grave cases, disbarment.
*   **Del Mundo v. Atty. Capistrano, 685 Phil. 687, 693 (2012).** The practice of law is a privilege given to lawyers who meet the high standards of legal proficiency and morality, including honesty, integrity and fair dealing.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 138, Sec. 27:**  Grounds for suspension or disbarment.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR)**

**Outcome:**

The SC suspended Atty. Noel from the practice of law for three (3) years due to inexcusable negligence, gross misconduct, and willful disobedience of lawful court orders. Disbarment as recommended by IBP was not imposed but he was warned that repetition of similar offense would be dealt with more severely.
