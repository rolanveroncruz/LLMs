## Legal Document Summary: Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) vs. Powergen, Inc. (G.R. No. 164299)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the trial court's order for issuance of a preliminary mandatory injunction.

**Key Issue:** Propriety of the trial court's issuance of a preliminary mandatory injunction compelling MIAA to comply with Article 7.3 of the Power Generation Agreement (PGA) regarding guaranteed minimum energy consumption.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversed the CA decision, and set aside the trial court's orders and writ of preliminary mandatory injunction.  The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Power Generation Agreement (PGA):** MIAA contracted Powergen to build and operate a power plant to provide a continuous power supply.
*   **Article 7.3 (PGA):** MIAA obligated to purchase a minimum guaranteed energy consumption of 4,000,000 KWH per month from Powergen at a discounted rate.
*   **Sixth Schedule (PGA):** Defines terms of power delivery, including billing based on MERALCO's billing system less a 40% discount.
*   **Notice to Proceed:**  Issued by MIAA, containing a clause *temporarily* waiving the minimum guaranteed energy consumption provision (Article 7.3) until full power capacity was attained. Powergen acknowledged receipt and acceptance.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Powergen's Claim:** MIAA breached the PGA by not purchasing the minimum guaranteed energy consumption and by underpaying based on a lower MERALCO rate. Powergen sought reformation of contract and specific performance.
*   **MIAA's Defense:** Relied on the Notice to Proceed, arguing it amended the PGA by temporarily suspending the guaranteed minimum consumption obligation.  MIAA argued no irreparable injury would result if the injunction was not granted.
*   **Risk of Prematurely Deciding the Merits:** The Supreme Court found that the issuance of the preliminary mandatory injunction effectively disposed of the main case (reformation of contract) without a full trial on the merits.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. CA (G.R. No. 79128):** Cited regarding the impropriety of issuing preliminary injunctions that effectively dispose of the main case.
*   **Capitol Medical Center, Inc. v. CA (G.R. No. 82499):**  Relied upon to define the purpose of a preliminary injunction (preserving status quo) and the exceptional circumstances under which a mandatory injunction may be issued.
*   **Rules of Court:** Reference to Rule 45 (Petition for Review on Certiorari) and Rule 65 (Certiorari).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The Notice to Proceed:**  The core of the dispute. Whether Powergen's "Certified Acknowledgment of Receipt and Acceptance" of the Notice to Proceed effectively amended Article 7.3 of the PGA is the central question. The Supreme Court suggests that a full trial is needed to assess the true intention of the parties.
*   **"Irreparable Injury":** The Court found Powergen's allegation of extreme urgency and irreparable injury (potential financial ruin) to be unsubstantiated and speculative.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Supreme Court correctly reversed the CA's decision.  The trial court abused its discretion by issuing a preliminary *mandatory* injunction that effectively granted Powergen the ultimate relief sought in its complaint (specific performance of Article 7.3).  The Court emphasized that a mandatory injunction is generally disfavored prior to a final hearing, and only warranted in cases of extreme urgency and clear entitlement. Powergen failed to demonstrate these prerequisites. The legal standard for preliminary injunction, as established in *Capitol Medical Center, Inc. v. CA*, was not met. The Court further recognized the potential for unfairly determining the outcome on a provisional matter before the merits can be heard. The central issue remains whether the parties intended to temporarily suspend the clause providing for a minimum energy consumption.
