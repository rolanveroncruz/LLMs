**Case Summary: *Ana De Guia San Pedro and Alejo Dope√±o vs. Hon. Fatima G. Asdala, et al.* (G.R. No. 164560, July 22, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing the CA's dismissal of a previous certiorari petition concerning the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) over an *accion reivindicatoria* (action for recovery of ownership).

**Key Issue:** Whether the MeTC has jurisdiction over a complaint for *accion reivindicatoria* where the assessed value of the subject property is within the jurisdictional limit set by R.A. No. 7691 amending B.P. Blg. 129.

**Facts:**

*   Heirs of spouses Dionisio filed a complaint for *accion reivindicatoria*, quieting of title, and damages against petitioners in the MeTC.
*   Petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss arguing the MeTC lacked jurisdiction as the subject matter was incapable of pecuniary estimation.
*   The MeTC denied the Motion to Dismiss, asserting jurisdiction under B.P. Blg. 129 as amended by R.A. No. 7691, because the assessed value of the property was within jurisdictional limits.
*   RTC dismissed Petitioners' certiorari petition.
*   The CA dismissed Petitioners' certiorari petition, stating appeal was the proper remedy.

**Holding:** Supreme Court dismissed the petition. The MeTC properly had jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The MeTC has exclusive original jurisdiction over actions involving title to or possession of real property where the assessed value does not exceed Php 50,000 in Metro Manila (R.A. No. 7691 amending B.P. Blg. 129, Section 33(3)).
*   **Remedy:** Appeal (Rule 45) is the proper remedy for assailing CA decisions, not certiorari (Rule 65), when appeal is available and adequate. Certiorari is not a substitute for a lost appeal.
*   **Accion Reivindicatoria:** An *accion reivindicatoria* falls under the classification of cases that involves "title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein." (citing *Heirs of Valeriano S. Concha, Sr. v. Spouses Lumocso*, G.R. No. 158121, December 21, 2007)
*   **Obligation to surrender possession:** The ruling in effect, implies that the petitioners have an obligation to surrender possession if the Dionisio heirs prevail in the lower court with their *accion reivindicatoria*.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are potentially liable for damages and attorney's fees as claimed in the original complaint if judgment is found against them.
*   Risk of dispossession of the property if the lower courts rule in favour of the respondents.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The decision rests heavily on procedural grounds (failure to appeal), which suggests the petitioners did not timely and properly appeal.
*   The lower court will proceed to decide on the substance of the ownership claim. Petitioners face the risk of losing the ownership claim.
*   The Court's reiteration of existing case law underscores the lack of legal basis for the Petitioners' claim that the MeTC lacked jurisdiction.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 (as amended by R.A. No. 7691), Section 33(3):** Defines the jurisdiction of the MeTC.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Provides for appeal by certiorari.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for certiorari.
*   *Pasiona, Jr. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 165471, July 21, 2008:  Addresses the exclusivity of appeal and the impropriety of certiorari as a substitute.
*   *Heirs of Valeriano S. Concha, Sr. v. Spouses Lumocso*, G.R. No. 158121, December 21, 2007:  Clarifies that actions for reconveyance or quieting of title are actions involving title to property.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The decision does not delve into the merits of the ownership dispute. The lower courts must determine the veracity of the conflicting claims.
