## Legal Document Summary: Cabulisan v. Pagalilauan (A.M. No. RTJ-96-1363)

**Type:** Administrative Matter against a Judge

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, First Division

**Date:** October 12, 1998

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Tomas Cabulisan (identity disputed)
*   **Respondent:** Judge Adrian N. Pagalilauan, RTC-Br. 12, Sanchez Mira, Cagayan

**Summary:**

This case concerns an administrative complaint filed against Judge Pagalilauan for (1) voyeurism (peeping at a tenant's daughter while she was bathing), (2) having a mistress, and (3) allowing local practitioners to write decisions for him. The Supreme Court found Judge Pagalilauan guilty of voyeurism and fined him P10,000.00, with a warning. The other charges were dismissed for lack of evidence.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Voyeurism (Grave Misconduct):**
    *   The Court found Judge Pagalilauan guilty of grave misconduct for peeping at Marilyn C. Dumayas.
    *   The Court gave more weight to Marilyn C. Dumayas' sworn affidavit despite her later testimony recanting key details. The Court reasoned her affidavit was more detailed and persuasive.
    *   The Court rejected the Judge's explanation of accidentally seeing her while balancing himself in the comfort room as "feeble."
    *   Voyeurism violates the "moral righteousness and uprightness" required of judges.

*   **Mistress:** This charge was dismissed.  Divina Calaycay, the alleged mistress, was found to be the widow of Judge Pagalilauan's predecessor and a friend.  No evidence of an illicit relationship was presented.

*   **Allowing Lawyers to Write Decisions:**  This charge was dismissed due to lack of evidence. Court interpreter denied knowledge, and no proof was offered.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Pagalilauan:**  Obligated to pay a fine of P10,000.00.  Subject to more severe penalties for repetition of similar acts. Obligated to uphold a high standard of moral conduct befitting a member of the judiciary.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Recanted Affidavit:**  The Court's decision to rely heavily on Dumayas' prior affidavit, despite her later testimony that contradicted it, could be viewed as problematic. Vitug, J. dissented on this point. The weight given to affidavits versus court testimony is a significant point of contention.
*   **Identity of Complainant:** The initial investigation questioned the existence of the complainant, Tomas Cabulisan. While the investigation continued based on witness testimony, the dubious identity of the complainant could raise concerns about the legitimacy of the initial complaint and potential bias.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** While the Court emphasizes Marilyn's positive assertion, the evidence is largely circumstantial, relying on interpretations of events in adjacent rooms with a partially open divider. This could be a point of challenge.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The decision cites numerous cases emphasizing the high moral standards expected of members of the judiciary (e.g., *Legaspi v. Garrete*, *Talens-Dabon v. Arceo*, *Abadilla v. Tabiliran, Jr.*).
*   General references to the principle that every government office is a public trust.

**Ambiguous Clauses & Points for Further Scrutiny:**

*   The precise layout and dimensions of the bathroom and comfort room, while described, leave room for interpretation regarding visibility. More detailed architectural information could further elucidate or refute the plausibility of the peeping.
*   The specific legal basis for the fine is not explicitly stated. Was the "grave misconduct" classified under a particular provision of the Code of Judicial Conduct or other relevant legislation? Clarification on this point would be beneficial.
