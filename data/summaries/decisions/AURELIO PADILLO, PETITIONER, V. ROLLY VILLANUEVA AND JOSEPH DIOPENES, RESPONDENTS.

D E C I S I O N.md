## Legal Document Summary: *Aurelio Padillo v. Rolly Villanueva and Joseph Diopenes* G.R. No. 209661

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari contesting the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld the denial of the cancellation of Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs) issued to Respondents Diopenes and Villanueva. Petitioner Padillo sought inclusion as a farmer-beneficiary, claiming a right to portions of land awarded to Respondents under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). The central issue is whether the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) can cancel registered CLOAs or Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) four years after their issuance.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **CARP Implementation:** The case revolves around the implementation of Republic Act No. 6657 (CARP Law) and its provisions for land distribution to farmer-beneficiaries.
*   **Issuance of CLOAs/TCTs:** The initial issuance of CLOAs to Diopenes and Villanueva created certain rights and expectations of ownership. Registration of CLOAs placed the land under the Torrens system.
*   **Petition for Inclusion:** Padillo's petition sought to be included as a farmer-beneficiary, effectively diminishing the land area awarded to Diopenes and Villanueva. The Regional Director initially granted this petition.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Indefeasibility of Title:** The Supreme Court, citing *Lonoy v. City of Iloilo* and *Estribillo v. Department of Agrarian Reform*, reaffirms the principle that CLOAs, once registered and after one year from issuance, become indefeasible and incontrovertible, similar to titles issued in registration proceedings. This poses a significant obstacle to Padillo's claim.
*   **Collateral Attack:** The Court held that Padillo's Petition for Inclusion was a collateral attack on Respondents' title, prohibited under Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree). *De Pedro v. Romasan Development Corporation* and *Goco v. Court of Appeals* are cited to define direct vs. collateral attack.
*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** The Court determined that the Regional Director lacked jurisdiction to entertain the Petition for Inclusion over land already covered by registered CLOAs and TCTs. Actions affecting title must be brought before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) or Municipal Trial Court (MTC) based on assessed value.
*   **DAR's Limited Authority:** While Republic Act No. 9700 (amending Section 24 of RA 6657) grants the DAR Secretary exclusive jurisdiction over cancellation of registered emancipation patents, CLOAs, and other titles, this authority is limited to certificates *under the DAR's jurisdiction*. Cancellation of registered CLOAs or TCTs requires a direct action in court.
*   **Potential for Alternative Action:** While Padillo cannot pursue cancellation through the DAR, the Court indicates he may file an action to *annul* Respondents' title before the competent court, acknowledging that certificates of title can be declared null and void if issued irregularly (citing *De Pedro v. Romasan Development Corporation*). This presents a high bar, given the principle of indefeasibility.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (CARP Law):** Foundation of the case, governing land distribution and farmer-beneficiary rights.
*   **PD 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Specifically Section 48, prohibiting collateral attacks on certificates of title.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980):** Determines court jurisdiction over actions involving title to real property.
*   **RA 9700:** Amends RA 6657, defining the DAR Secretary's jurisdiction over cancellation of certain titles.
*   **Lahora, et al. v. Dayanghirang, Jr., et. al.:** Affirms the indefeasibility of titles derived from public land grants after one year.
*   **Estribillo v. Department of Agrarian Reform:** Reaffirms that emancipation patents and CLOAs are entitled to indefeasibility.
*   **Lonoy v. City of Iloilo:** Cited on indefeasibility of title and the effect of registration.
*   **De Pedro v. Romasan Development Corporation** and **Goco v. Court of Appeals:** Defines direct vs. collateral attack of title.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The key contentious point is the interpretation of DAR's authority to correct or cancel CLOAs versus the indefeasibility of registered titles.
*   There may be questions regarding the Regional Director's initial decision to include Padillo as a farmer-beneficiary, given the potential jurisdictional issues raised by the Supreme Court decision, and if this decision became final and its effects on the land in dispute.
*   The Courtâ€™s suggestion that Padillo may pursue an action for annulment of Respondents' title is potentially misleading. While technically possible, it faces a difficult legal hurdle given the strong presumption of indefeasibility and the lack of clear evidence suggesting the CLOAs were issued irregularly.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied Padillo's petition, reinforcing the indefeasibility of titles and the limits of DAR's authority. The decision highlights the importance of direct challenges to title within the prescribed timeframe and before the correct forum. The case serves as a cautionary tale regarding collateral attacks on titles and the consequences of pursuing administrative remedies when judicial action is required. Padillo's legal options are now limited, with a potential, albeit challenging, path forward via an action to annul the titles in court.
