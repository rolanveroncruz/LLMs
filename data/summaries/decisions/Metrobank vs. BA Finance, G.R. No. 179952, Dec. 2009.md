## Legal Document Summary: *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. BA Finance Corporation and Malayan Insurance Co., Inc.* G.R. No. 179952, December 4, 2009

**Case Overview:** This case concerns the liability of a collecting bank (Asianbank, now Metrobank) for allowing the deposit and withdrawal of a crossed check payable to two payees (BA Finance and Lamberto Bitanga) without the endorsement of one payee (BA Finance). The check represented insurance proceeds for a stolen car, where BA Finance was the mortgagee and loss payee under the insurance policy.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Mortgage Clause:** Bitanga mortgaged his car to BA Finance, covenanting to insure it and make any loss payable to BA Finance.
*   **Insurance Policy:** Malayan Insurance issued a policy stating "Loss, if any, shall be payable to BA FINANCE CORP. as its interest may appear" and prohibiting cancellation without BA Finance's consent.
*   **Theft and Check Issuance:** The car was stolen, and Malayan Insurance issued a crossed check payable to "B.A. Finance Corporation and Lamberto Bitanga" marked "For Deposit Payees' Account Only."
*   **Improper Deposit and Withdrawal:** Bitanga deposited the check into his personal account at Asianbank without BA Finance's endorsement and withdrew the full amount.
*   **Breach and Claim:** Bitanga defaulted on his loan with BA Finance. BA Finance discovered the check deposit and demanded payment from Asianbank, which was refused, leading to this litigation.

**Legal Issues:**

*   Does BA Finance have a cause of action against Asianbank in the absence of delivery of the check to BA Finance?
*   Is Asianbank liable for the full value of the check, or only half, given that BA Finance was a co-payee?
*   Is Asianbank liable for exemplary damages?
*   Is Malayan Insurance liable to Asianbank under a third-party complaint?

**Court's Holding & Reasoning:**

*   **Cause of Action:** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts, holding that BA Finance *does* have a cause of action against Asianbank. The bank breached its duty by accepting the check without proper endorsement.
*   **Full Liability:** Asianbank is liable for the *full* value of the check. As the collecting bank, it warranted all prior endorsements and acted negligently in allowing the deposit without BA Finance's endorsement. This constitutes payment on a missing endorsement, equivalent to payment on a forged endorsement. The Court reasoned that Article 1207 and 1208 of the civil code are irrelevent as the obligation of Malayan Insurance to pay the proceeds is independent of the payee’s internal arrangement.
*   **Exemplary Damages:** The award of exemplary damages was upheld. The Court found that the negligence of the bank’s employee was gross, justifying the award of exemplary damages to serve as a warning to the bank.
*   **Dismissal of Third-Party Complaint:** The dismissal of Asianbank's third-party complaint against Malayan Insurance was upheld. Malayan Insurance acted reasonably in issuing a check with joint payees, ensuring the funds would be properly disbursed, as supported by company policy.

**Key Legal Principles and Statutory References:**

*   **Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL), Section 41:** Requires all payees to endorse a check payable to two or more payees who are not partners, unless one has authority to endorse for the others.
*   **NIL, Sections 65 & 66:** Guarantees of indorsers regarding the genuineness and validity of instruments.
*   **Associated Bank v. CA (208 SCRA 465):** While the SC agreed with the CA, it qualified its ruling, and said that the rule under Associated Bank applies because the payment of the check over a missing indorsement is equivalent to payment on a forged indorsement. The Court applied this precedent. The Court noted that in the Cross claim the Trial court ordered Bitanga to pay back the full amount with interest to the bank, thus to find the bank not liable for the full amount to BA finance would amount to unjust enrichment.
*   **Civil Code, Article 2176:** Basis for quasi-delict liability.
*   **Civil Code, Article 2231:** Provides for exemplary damages in quasi-delict cases for gross negligence.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Metrobank (formerly Asianbank):** Liable to BA Finance for the full amount of the check (P224,500) with interest, plus exemplary damages and attorney's fees. Liable for gross negligence in allowing deposit without proper endorsement.
*   **Bitanga:** Liable to Metrobank under the cross-claim for the amounts Metrobank is ordered to pay BA Finance.
*   **Malayan Insurance:** No liability. Fulfilled its obligations by issuing the check with joint payees.
*   **BA Finance:** Entitled to recover the full amount of the check from Metrobank.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Establishing Gross Negligence:** While the court found gross negligence, this is a fact-specific determination, and future cases with different circumstances may have different outcomes on this point.

**Conclusion:**

The Court affirmed the principle that collecting banks have a high duty of care in handling negotiable instruments and are liable for negligence that results in improper payment. The case underscores the importance of strict compliance with endorsement requirements, especially for checks with multiple payees. The final judgment shifts the loss to Metrobank, as the collecting bank, which must seek recourse from Bitanga.
