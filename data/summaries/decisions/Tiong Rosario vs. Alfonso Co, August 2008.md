**Case Summary: *Tiong Rosario v. Alfonso Co*, G.R. No. 133608, August 26, 2008 (585 Phil. 236)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the RTC's order suspending criminal proceedings (violation of B.P. Blg. 22) against a corporate officer due to the pendency of the corporation's petition for suspension of payments before the SEC under P.D. No. 902-A.

**Facts:**

*   Alfonso Co, as Chairman/President of Modern Paper Products, Inc. (MPPI), issued China Banking Corporation checks to Tiong Rosario (TR Mercantile) for paper product purchases on credit.
*   The checks were dishonored due to stop payment or insufficient funds.
*   TRM demanded payment, but Co failed to comply. TRM filed criminal complaints for violation of B.P. Blg. 22.
*   Prior to the criminal cases, MPPI filed a Petition for Suspension of Payments with the SEC under P.D. No. 902-A, seeking rehabilitation. The SEC issued an order creating a Management Committee and suspending all actions for claims against MPPI.
*   Co moved to suspend the criminal proceedings in the MTC, arguing that the SEC case presented a prejudicial question.
*   The RTC granted Co's petition for certiorari and ordered the suspension of the criminal cases.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Issue:** Whether criminal proceedings against a corporate officer for B.P. Blg. 22 can be suspended due to the corporation's pending petition for suspension of payments with the SEC.
*   **Applicable Laws:**
    *   Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law): Defines the offense and liability for issuing dishonored checks.
    *   Presidential Decree No. 902-A: Grants the SEC authority to suspend actions for claims against corporations under rehabilitation (Section 6(c)).
    *   Rules of Court (Rules 41 & 45, Rule 111).
    *   Insolvency Law (limited relevance - only suspends executions and collection suits)

**Holding and Rationale:**

The Supreme Court reversed the RTC, holding that the criminal cases should proceed.

*   **"Actions for Claims" Defined:** The term "actions for claims" under Section 6(c) of P.D. No. 902-A refers to *debts or demands of a pecuniary nature* (citing *Finasia Investment and Finance Corp. v. Court of Appeals*).
*   **B.P. Blg. 22 as a Criminal Prosecution:** Violation of B.P. Blg. 22 is an offense against *public order*, not simply a debt collection mechanism (citing *Lozano v. Martinez*). The purpose is to deter worthless checks to prevent public harm. Criminal prosecution is initiated by the *State*.
*   **Distinction between Criminal and Civil Aspects:** While conviction might lead to restitution, the primary objective of a criminal action is punishment, and the civil action is merely incidental.
*   **Timing of Suspension:** The suspension of actions for claims takes effect only *upon appointment of a management committee, rehabilitation receiver, board, or body* (citing *Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court*).  Here, Co had a period between dishonor/demand and the SEC order where he could have made good on the checks.
*   **Absurdity of Allowing Escape from Criminal Liability:** P.D. No. 902-A should not allow individuals to avoid criminal prosecution for B.P. Blg. 22 simply by filing a petition for corporate rehabilitation. However, any *indemnification* awarded by the criminal court constitutes a "claim" suspendible under Sec. 6(c).
*   **Corporate Officer Liability:** B.P. Blg. 22 explicitly states that the person signing the check on behalf of the corporation is liable.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main contention revolves around the interpretation of "actions for claims" under P.D. 902-A and its applicability to criminal prosecutions under B.P. 22. The SC clarified that "actions for claims" means pecuniary claims and therefore excludes criminal cases where the primary intent is punishment.
*   A potential area of dispute is the distinction between the criminal and civil aspects. This ruling suggests that while the criminal prosecution can proceed, any monetary award of damages would be considered a "claim" and therefore is subject to stay of execution during rehab proceedings.
*   The ruling emphasizes that the suspension of actions applies only after the creation of a management committee. This point can affect cases where dishonor and demand happened prior to the creation of such a committee.

**Relevance for a Lawyer:**

*   **Criminal Defense:** If representing a corporate officer charged with B.P. 22 while the corporation is under rehabilitation, argue that *any monetary award* should be suspended but concede that the criminal prosecution can proceed (according to this case).
*   **Creditor's Rights:** If representing a creditor of a corporation under rehabilitation, rely on this case to pursue criminal prosecution of the officer *simultaneously* with the rehabilitation proceedings, but acknowledge that any monetary damages recovered must be asserted as a claim within the rehabilitation.
*   **Corporate Rehabilitation:** This case sets the stage for the fact that PD 902-A will not be used as a shield for the criminal activity of the corporation.
