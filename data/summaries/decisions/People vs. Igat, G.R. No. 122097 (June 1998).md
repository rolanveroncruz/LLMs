**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense Arguments:** The defense argued insufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, raising issues of inconsistencies in the victim's testimony, the timing of the hymenal tear, and the credibility of witnesses. They also argued for the application of Article 27 of the Revised Penal Code to limit the duration of the Reclusion Perpetua to 20 years.
*   **Victim's Credibility:** The Court heavily relied on the victim's testimony, emphasizing its consistency, emotional delivery, and the absence of any apparent motive to falsely accuse her father.
*   **Intimidation:** The court emphasizes that the accused's moral authority as a father can substitute violence or intimidation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:**
    *   Article 27: Addresses the duration of perpetual penalties, including Reclusion Perpetua (pre-RA 7659 amendment). The court decided that the penalties would not be limited to 20 years, due to the date the crime was committed.
*   **People v. Echegaray (257 SCRA 561):** Cited for principles in evaluating evidence in rape cases, including the need for thorough examination and caution due to the ease of accusation and difficulty of disproving.
*   **People v. Magpantay:** Addressed the victim's willingness to undergo the physical examination and testifying in public trial.
*   **People v. Caballes:** The improbability of the victim to fabricate lies against her own father.
*   **People v. Tumala, Jr.:** Emphasizing that error-free testimonies are not expected, especially if the witness recounts the details of a harrowing experience.
*   **People v. Agbayani:** The different facets of intimidation relative to rape cases.
*   **People v. Esquela, People v. Dones, People v. Taneo:** The fact that the bare denial of the appellant cannot overcome the testimony of the victim.
*   **People v. Entes:** Addressed the affidavit of desistance or a pardon by the offended party, not justifying dismissal of the complaint for rape.
*   **RA No. 7659:** Cited in relation to the imposition of the death penalty.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Aspects & Areas for Further Inquiry:**

*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The defense raised inconsistencies in the victim's testimony regarding the presence of a bolo. While the Court addressed this, further analysis of the transcript might reveal additional nuances.
*   **Flight of the Accused:** The Court considered the flight of the accused as a sign of guilt; however, there might have been external causes or plausible explanations behind this occurrence.

**Overall Assessment:** The court strongly affirmed the trial court's decision, highlighting the victim's credibility and the weight of the evidence presented. The defense arguments were dismissed, and the sentence of Reclusion Perpetua was upheld.
