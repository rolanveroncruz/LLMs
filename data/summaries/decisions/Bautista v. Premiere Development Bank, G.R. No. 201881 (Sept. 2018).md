**Legal Document Summary: Bautista v. Premiere Development Bank (G.R. No. 201881)**

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court (SC) partially granted the petition of Spouses Bautista, finding the extrajudicial foreclosure sale of their property by Premiere Development Bank (PDB) void ab initio due to non-compliance with mandatory posting and publication requirements under Act No. 3135 after a rescheduled sale date. The RTC and CA had previously upheld the sale, deeming the Bautistas estopped by their attempts to redeem the property. The SC reversed, asserting that the posting and publication requirements are jurisdictional, rooted in public policy, and cannot be waived. The SC declined to determine the exact amount of the Bautistas' outstanding debt, characterizing it as a factual matter.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgage:** The Bautistas mortgaged their property to PDB to secure a loan. Key terms included a floating interest rate, penalty charges (24% per annum), and prepayment penalties (3% of outstanding balance).
*   **Act No. 3135:** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure sales and mandates posting and publication of the notice of sale. Section 3 requires publication in a newspaper of general circulation for at least three consecutive weeks if the property value exceeds P400.00.
*   **Rescheduled Sale & Notice:**  The initial sale was properly noticed (published in "The Challenger News"). However, the rescheduled sale was conducted without any subsequent posting or publication. This is the core of the legal issue.
*   **Redemption:**  The Bautistas attempted to redeem the property, tendering an amount PDB rejected as insufficient.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Premiere Development Bank:** Held liable for the invalid foreclosure sale due to the failure to properly post and publish notice of the rescheduled sale. Risks include potential liability for damages related to the wrongful foreclosure (though not explicitly addressed in this decision). PDB has the obligation to initiate a new extrajudicial foreclosure, adhering strictly to Act No. 3135.
*   **Spouses Bautista:** The specific amount of their outstanding debt remains undetermined and will likely be subject to further proceedings or negotiation. They are still obligated to repay the loan.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135:** Central to the case, specifically Section 3 (posting & publication requirements).
*   ***Philippine National Bank v. Nepomuceno Productions, Inc.*** (G.R. No. 139479):  Emphasizes the public policy considerations behind posting and publication requirements in Act No. 3135, stating that the purpose is not primarily for the benefit of the mortgagor but for the public.  This case specifically rejected arguments that rescheduling a sale waives the need for republication and reposting.
*   ***Perez v. Court of Appeals*** (G.R. No. 157616): Distinguished and deemed inapplicable by the Supreme Court. The CA incorrectly relied on this case. The SC stated that the irregularities in *Perez* were limited to issues such as erroneous computation of the debt and lack of notice, unlike this case where the non-compliance with posting and publication requirements was the primary issue.
*   ***Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Miranda*** (G.R. No. 187917) and ***Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals*** (G.R. No. 125838): Reinforced that publication in a newspaper of general circulation is essential to the validity of the foreclosure proceedings.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Amount of Debt:** The precise amount owed by the Bautistas is not resolved. The SC declines to address this factual issue, meaning the debt remains undetermined.
*   **Estoppel:** The lower courts' finding of estoppel was overturned. The Bautistas' attempt to redeem did not waive the mandatory posting and publication requirements.
*   **Waiver:** The SC emphasizes that the requirements of posting and publication cannot be waived by either party, as they serve a broader public policy purpose.

**Legal Precision & Key Takeaways:**

*   **Strict Compliance Required:** Extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings must strictly adhere to the notice requirements of Act No. 3135. Rescheduled sales necessitate new notices.
*   **Jurisdictional Defect:** Failure to properly post and publish notice of a rescheduled sale renders the sale void ab initio.
*   **Public Policy Paramount:** The posting and publication requirements are designed to protect the public interest in fair and transparent foreclosure sales, not just the mortgagor.
*   **Limited Scope of Appeal:** The Supreme Court's jurisdiction is limited to questions of law, precluding a determination of the specific amount owed.

**Recommendations**
*   PDB must reinitiate foreclosure proceedings, ensuring strict compliance with Act No. 3135.
*   Negotiation with the Bautistas regarding the outstanding debt is advisable to avoid further litigation.
