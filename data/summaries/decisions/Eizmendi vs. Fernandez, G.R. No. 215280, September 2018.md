## Legal Document Summary: *Eizmendi v. Fernandez*, G.R. No. 215280 (2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision allowing evidence related to the February 23, 2013 Valle Verde Country Club, Inc. (VVCCI) board of directors election.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in allowing evidence regarding the February 23, 2013 election when Fernandez's primary complaint was for invalidation of corporate acts (his suspension) based on the allegedly illegal constitution of the board, effectively circumventing the 15-day period to file an election contest under the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) *GRANTS* the petition, reversing the CA and reinstating the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order excluding evidence related to the election.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Fernandez's Complaint:** Filed an action to invalidate his suspension by VVCCI's Board, claiming they lacked authority due to the alleged lack of quorum during the February 23, 2013 election. Includes requests for invalidation of the election itself.
*   **Petitioners' Argument (Eizmendi, et al.):** Fernandez is improperly attempting to circumvent the 15-day election contest period. Allowing such evidence effectively re-opens the issue of the election's validity, which was already addressed in a prior case (G.R. No. 209120) involving a complaint filed by VVCCI.
*   **SC's Reasoning:**
    *   Fernandez's complaint is *partly* an election contest because it challenges the legitimacy of the Board's election.
    *   Allowing the evidence to prove the Board's illegitimacy would violate the 15-day rule, frustrating the purpose of speedy resolution of corporate leadership disputes. *Tawang Multi-Purpose Cooperative v. La Trinidad Water District* (2011) is cited regarding indirect actions.
    *   The RTC correctly limited the issue to whether due process was observed in Fernandez's suspension.
    *   Dismissed the claims of res judicata and "law of the case" citing lack of identicality in parties and causes of action.
    *  Affirmed the principle of stare decisis as applied to previous holding that a complaint challenging election as based on improper conduct/lack of quorum is an election contest per Interim Rules.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies, Rule 6, Section 2:** Defines "election contest."
*   **Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies, Rule 6, Section 4:** Authorizes outright dismissal of insufficient election contest complaints.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 135, Section 5:** Inherent power of courts to amend and control processes.

**Case Law:**

*   **Valley Verde Country Club, Inc. v. Eizmendi Jr, et al.,** (G.R. No. 209120, October 14, 2013) This is a similar case involving same parties. SC ruled that complaint filed by VVCC was an election contest, but did not definitely rule on the effect of filing an election contest beyond the 15 day period under the Interim Rules. SC used this case as basis for principle of *stare decisis* to apply.
*   **Yu v. Court of Appeals:** Distinguishes from the principle of *stare decisis* to this case, due to the claim that the lack of due process in failing to provide a member with notice for a membership share due.
*  **Valley Golf Club, Inc. v. Vda. De Caram** the principle of *stare decisis* does not apply.
*   **Abaria, et al. v. National Labor Relations Commission, et al.:** The *stare decisis* principle states, "under the doctrine of stare decisis, once a court has laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle and apply it to all future cases where the facts are substantially the same, even though the parties may be different."

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   **For Fernandez:** His claim for invalidation of his suspension based on the Board's alleged illegitimacy is now significantly hampered. He is limited to challenging the *process* of his suspension (due process) but not the Board's authority *per se*.
*   **Precedent:** The ruling reinforces the strict application of the 15-day period for election contests, potentially hindering challenges to corporate governance based on questionable elections if not timely filed.
*   **Ambiguity:** It is arguable whether the remedy should have been an intervention in the Commercial Case No. 13-190, and the Court may have blurred the lines regarding the validity of the Board.

**Conclusion:** The SC's decision prioritizes the stability of corporate governance by strictly enforcing the election contest filing deadline. Fernandez is limited to challenging the process of his suspension. The ruling underscores the importance of promptly challenging election results within the statutory period to prevent disruption of corporate affairs.
