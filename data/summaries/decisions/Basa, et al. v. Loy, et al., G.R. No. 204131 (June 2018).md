**Case Summary: Basa, et al. vs. Loy, et al., G.R. No. 204131 (2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the dismissal of a quieting of title action filed by petitioners (Basa, Ogale, Lagasca, and Apostol) against respondents (Loy, heirs of Carantes).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Subject Property:** A 496 sq. m. residential lot originally titled to Busa Carantes, later mortgaged and foreclosed by Angeline Loy.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:** Petitioners allege that Robert Carantes (heir of Busa Carantes) sold them portions of the property *prior* to the foreclosure, presenting unnotarized deeds of sale and an affidavit from Carantes. They sought to quiet their titles and invalidate Loy's title as a cloud on their ownership.
*   **Respondents' Defense:** Loy claimed good faith as a mortgagee and subsequent owner through foreclosure, unaware of any prior unrecorded sales. Carantes initially disputed the sales to petitioners, alleging non-payment.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** Dismissed the case due to petitioners' failure to present the *original* deeds of sale (best evidence rule) and the inadmissibility of Carantes's affidavit without his testimony.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** Affirmed the trial court. Held that petitioners failed to prove legal or equitable title, an essential element for a quieting of title action. Found discrepancies in petitioners' evidence (mismatched documents presented at trial vs. in motion for reconsideration, inconsistencies in testimony).

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Obligated to prove legal or equitable title to the property to succeed in their quieting of title action. They failed to present admissible evidence of valid sales from Robert Carantes.
*   **Angeline Loy:** Asserted her right to the property as a result of the foreclosure sale.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioners' Loss of Property:** The dismissal of the case means petitioners may face eviction or loss of possession of the portions of the land they occupy, as Loy's title is recognized.
*   **Loy's Title:** Loy's title is now free from the cloud asserted by the petitioners' claims.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Quieting of Title Requirements:** Cites *Mananquil v. Moico* (2012) and *Eland Philippines, Inc. v. Garcia* (2010) regarding the essential elements: (1) legal or equitable title in the plaintiff and (2) a cloud on that title that is invalid or inoperative.
*   **Best Evidence Rule (Section 3, Rule 130, Rules of Court):** Original documents must be presented unless an exception applies (e.g., loss of original, original in opponent's possession).  The court found no applicable exception to the failure to provide originals
*   **Burden of Proof in Civil Cases:**  *Acabal vs. Acabal, 454 SCRA 555* stresses that the burden of proof rests upon the party who asserts an affirmative issue.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Validity of Unrecorded Sales:** The core issue revolves around the enforceability of the unnotarized/unrecorded deeds of sale to petitioners against Loy, a subsequent mortgagee/purchaser. The court implicitly ruled against their validity in this context.
*   **"Good Faith" of Loy:**  While petitioners argued Loy was not a good faith purchaser, the court did not explicitly rule on this point, focusing instead on the lack of evidence supporting the petitioners' claims to the property in the first place.
*    **Affidavit of Robert Carantes:  - *People vs. Brioso, 37 SCRA 336* Affidavits are generally rejected in judicial proceeding as hearsay, unless the affiants themselves are placed on the witness stand to testify thereon

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   **Petitioners Failed to Meet Burden of Proof** Petitioners did not sufficiently discharge the burden of proof for a claim of quieting of title. The failure to adduce adequate evidence of the land sale, and the best evidence rule caused critical damage. 

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of the quieting of title action. The petitioners failed to establish their legal or equitable title to the property through admissible evidence, primarily due to the failure to present the original deeds of sale and inconsistencies in their evidence. Loy's title, obtained through foreclosure, remains valid.
