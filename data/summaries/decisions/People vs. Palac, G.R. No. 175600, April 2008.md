## Legal Document Summary: *People vs. Pasaol Palac*, G.R. No. 175600

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Leonel Pasaol Palac for three counts of rape.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charges:** Appellant, along with two co-accused (still at large), was charged with three counts of rape under the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The information alleged conspiracy to commit rape by force and intimidation against a 15-year-old victim (AAA).
*   **Prosecution's Case:** The victim was drugged with a beverage and subsequently raped by appellant and his co-accused in succession. The victim testified to the events, including the discussions among the accused regarding the act and their encouragement of each other during the commission.
*   **Defense:** Alibi; Appellant claimed to be at CCC's house (AAA's uncle) on the night of the incident.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Appellant is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of rape.
*   Appellant is sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* for each count.
*   Appellant is obligated to pay the victim P50,000 in moral damages for each count (P150,000 total), P50,000 as civil indemnity, and P25,000 as exemplary damages each count (P75,000 total), the costs of the suit.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Conspiracy:** The ruling hinges on the finding of conspiracy, even though the co-accused were not tried. The success of the finding of concert can be affected by the availability of the co-conspirators to testify in court and the circumstances surrounding their absence.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The conviction relies heavily on the victim's testimony. While the courts gave great deference to the credibility of her as a witness, the defense made points regarding several instances of inconsistencies regarding the incident. The inconsistencies could be cause for error given the reliance of the victim's statements.
*   **"Craft" as Aggravating Circumstance:** The Court of Appeals justified the award of exemplary damages based on the aggravating circumstance of "craft" because the Appellant, along with Argentillo and Vilarde, hoodwinked AAA by offering her a drink laced with drugs that caused her to become dizzy and weakened her resistance. This determination should be consistent with evidence and in line with RPC provisions.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** Although the Court dismissed the issue regarding the delay in reporting, the delay in the report could affect the conviction.
