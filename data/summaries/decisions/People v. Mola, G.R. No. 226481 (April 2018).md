## Legal Document Summary: People v. Mola, G.R. No. 226481

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision; Drug Possession/Sale (Violation of Section 5, Article II, R.A. No. 9165).

**Holding:** Appellant Jaycent Mola acquitted due to the prosecution's failure to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, specifically regarding the chain of custody and compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Illegal sale of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (Shabu) in violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165.
*   **Chain of Custody (Crucial Issue):** The Court focused on the broken chain of custody as the primary basis for acquittal. Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 21 of R.A. 9165 regarding the immediate inventory and photographing of seized drugs in the presence of mandatory witnesses (accused, media representative, DOJ/NPS representative, and elected public official).

**Problems with Prosecution's Case**
1. Non-compliance with Section 21, R.A. 9165:
  * Marking not done at the place of arrest without justifiable reason.
  * Lack of required witnesses (media, DOJ/NPS representative, elected public official) during inventory.
  * The prosecution failed to sufficiently explain why these witnesses were absent.
  * The "witness" (store owner) was not present during the inventory process.
2. Deficient testimony of the forensic chemist.
  * Failed to certify the seized item presented for laboratory examination was the substance seized.
  * Failed to show how the sachet of shabu was handled during and after the laboratory examination and on the identity of the person/s who had custody of the item before it was presented to the court as evidence.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Specifically Section 5, Article II (illegal sale of drugs) and Section 21 (chain of custody requirements).
*   **R.A. No. 10640 (Amendment to R.A. No. 9165):** Although not applicable directly (crime committed before its effectivity), the Court discussed the legislative intent behind the amendment, recognizing the impracticality and frequent non-compliance with the original Section 21 and the intention to avoid dismissals on technicalities.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The Court found the prosecution's explanation for failing to comply with Section 21 insufficient. The argument that the arresting officer was alone and that there were too many people at the scene was unpersuasive.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court reiterated that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty cannot prevail over the constitutionally enshrined presumption of innocence. Non-compliance with the chain of custody requirements negates the presumption of regularity.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving a valid cause for non-compliance with Section 21. They must show justifiable grounds and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved. This burden was not met.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The case highlights the importance of strict adherence to chain of custody requirements in drug cases, particularly Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165. Failure to comply can lead to acquittal, even if the accused is otherwise potentially guilty.
*   The ruling serves as a reminder that the prosecution must proactively address any deviations from the required procedures during trial and provide convincing justifications for non-compliance.
*   It could create future precedence.
