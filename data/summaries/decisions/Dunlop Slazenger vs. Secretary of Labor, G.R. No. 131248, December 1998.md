**Case Summary: Dunlop Slazenger (Phils.), Inc. vs. Hon. Secretary of Labor and Employment and Dunlop Slazenger Staff Association - APSOTEU, G.R. No. 131248, December 11, 1998**

**Facts:**

Dunlop Slazenger (Phils.), Inc. (Employer) challenges the Secretary of Labor's Resolution and Order calling for a certification election sought by Dunlop Slazenger Staff Association - APSOTEU (Union). The Employer argues that the Union is composed of both supervisory and rank-and-file employees, which is impermissible under Article 245 of the Labor Code, and lacks legal standing.

**Key Provisions & Legal Issues:**

*   **Article 245 of the Labor Code:** This is the central provision. It prohibits supervisory employees from joining a labor organization of rank-and-file employees. The Employer argued that the Union violated this.
*   **Definition of Supervisory Employee (Article 212(m) of the Labor Code & Section 1(t), Rule I, Book V of the Omnibus Rules):** Key to the dispute. The Court reiterates the test: does the employee have the authority to act in the interest of the employer using independent judgment, not just routine/clerical tasks?
*   **Appropriate Bargaining Unit:** The court acknowledges that supervisors can form a bargaining unit separate from rank-and-file employees. However, the composition of the Union seeking representation is the problem.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court granted the petition, annulling the Secretary of Labor's order for a certification election.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Mixed Membership is Fatal:** The Court, citing *Toyota Motor Philippines v. Toyota Motors Philippines Corporation Labor Union, 268 SCRA 573 [1997]*, emphasized that a union composed of both supervisory and rank-and-file employees is *not a legitimate labor organization*. Such a union lacks the right to file a petition for certification election.
*   **Pre-election Conference Remediation Rejected:** The Secretary of Labor's suggestion to remedy the mixed membership through exclusion-inclusion proceedings during the pre-election conference was rejected. The Court stated that the "basic antipathy" between the interests of supervisors and rank-and-file employees cannot be cured that way.
*   **Job Description vs. Title:** The Court looked beyond job titles to the actual job descriptions to determine if the employees were supervisory or rank-and-file, in line with precedent such as *Engineering Equipment, Inc. v. NLRC, 133 SCRA 752 [1984]*.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Employee Classification:** The core issue hinges on the classification of employees as supervisory or rank-and-file.  The Employer argued that the Union included rank-and-file employees. The lack of concrete evidence during the initial petition process about job responsibilities created grounds for dispute.
*   **Statutory Compliance:** While the Union attempted to comply with reportorial requirements, the Court's decision didn't focus on the legal personality of the union but rather on the core issue of mixed membership.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Toyota Motor Philippines v. Toyota Motors Philippines Corporation Labor Union, 268 SCRA 573 [1997]:**  Cited as precedent on the illegitimacy of mixed unions and their inability to petition for certification elections.
*   **Engineering Equipment, Inc. v. NLRC, 133 SCRA 752 [1984]:** Cited for the principle that job description, not the employee's title, determines the nature of employment.
*   **San Miguel Corp. Supervisors and Exempt Employees Union v. Laguesma, 277 SCRA 370 [1997]; Belyca Corporation v. Ferrer-Calleja, 168 SCRA 184 [1988]:** Cited as examples of rulings regarding appropriate bargaining units.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

This case involves a petition for certiorari challenging the DOLE Secretary's order for a certification election. The critical issue is whether the petitioning Union is composed of both supervisory and rank-and-file employees. The Supreme Court, relying heavily on Article 245 of the Labor Code and *Toyota Motor Philippines*, held that a union with mixed membership is not a legitimate labor organization and cannot petition for a certification election. The case highlights the importance of accurately classifying employees as either supervisory or rank-and-file, focusing on the actual job duties, and serves as a warning against attempting to remedy mixed memberships through pre-election conferences. The decision underscores the irreconcilable interests between supervisory and rank-and-file employees in collective bargaining.
