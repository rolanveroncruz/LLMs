## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Capco* (G.R. No. 183088)

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Donato Capco for violation of Section 5 (illegal sale of dangerous drugs) and Section 15 (use of dangerous drugs) of RA 9165, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, RA 9165:** Illegal sale, trading, etc., of dangerous drugs. Penalty: Life imprisonment to death and a fine of P500,000.00 to P10,000,000.00
*   **Section 15, RA 9165:** Use of dangerous drugs. Penalty: Minimum of six months rehabilitation for the first offense.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165:** Custody and Disposition of Confiscated Drugs. Details the procedures for inventory, photography, and handling of seized drugs immediately after confiscation.

**Accusations and Convictions:**

*   **Criminal Case No. 03-3233:**  Sale of 0.03 gram of Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride (shabu) for P100.00 (Violation of Sec. 5, Art. II, RA 9165). Conviction affirmed.
*   **Criminal Case No. 03-3561:** Use of Methylamphetamine (shabu) based on confirmatory test (Violation of Sec. 15, Art. II, RA 9165). Initially pleaded guilty and sentenced to rehabilitation, execution deferred.

**Appellant's Arguments:**

1.  **Failure to Present Informant:** The prosecution's failure to present the confidential informant or adequately explain their absence constitutes suppression of evidence.
2.  **Violation of Sec. 21, RA 9165:**  Failure of the buy-bust team to take Capco's photograph with the seized shabu and conduct a physical inventory in his presence, violating mandatory procedures.
3.  **Hiatus in Chain of Custody:** Lack of testimony from all personnel involved in handling the evidence, from seizure to forensic examination, casts doubt on the integrity of the chain of custody.

**Court's Ruling & Rationale:**

*   **Affirmed the CA's decision** upholding the RTC conviction.
*   **Informant's Testimony:** Presentation of the informant is not essential for conviction. Their testimony is merely corroborative and revealing their identity could endanger them, citing *People v. Peñaflorida, Jr.*
*   **Sec. 21 Compliance:** Strict compliance with Sec. 21 is not mandatory if the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved, citing *People v. Teodoro.* Non-compliance alone does not render the arrest illegal or the evidence inadmissible.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Prosecution sufficiently proved the chain of custody was unbroken. PO2 Barrameda identified the marked sachet, corroborated by PO1 Santos. Forensic chemist's report confirms the substance as shabu.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:**  The court upheld the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties by law enforcement officers, absent evidence to the contrary.
*   **Penalty:** Upheld the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00, consistent with Sec. 5, Art. II of RA 9165.

**Case Law References:**

*   *People v. Peñaflorida, Jr.* (G.R. No. 175604) - Regarding the non-presentation of informants.
*   *People v. Teodoro* (G.R. No. 185164) - Regarding the non-compliance of Section 21 and it's affect on the evidence.
*   *People v. Santos* (G.R. No. 176735) - Regarding the requirement for drug cases (proof of the transaction + presentation of the drug)
* *People v. Macatingag* (G.R. No. 181037) - Presumption of integrity for the evidence preserved.
*  *People v. Llamado* (G.R. No. 185278) - Testimony of police officer is credible under the presumption that officers performed their duties.
*   *People v. Darisan* (G.R. No. 176151) - Reaffirming the trial court's decision,

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Reliance on Presumption of Regularity:** Heavily relies on the presumption of regularity, which could be challenged if evidence of bad faith or tampering emerges.
*   **Chain of Custody Arguments:** While the court found sufficient evidence, meticulous documentation of the chain of custody remains crucial to avoid challenges.
*   **Discretion in Sec. 21 Compliance:** Courts interpretation of the Sec. 21 could vary. A future case with more egregious violations might yield a different result.
*   **No actual photo in record.** The court noted that the photograph of the drugs seized was non existant. This would cast doubt on the case.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld Capco's conviction based on the evidence presented and legal presumptions. However, potential challenges remain regarding the application of Sec. 21 and the reliance on the presumption of regularity. Any future case must pay strict adherence to the rules for preservation of evidence.
