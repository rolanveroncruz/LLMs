**Legal Document Summary: *Romeo Samonte v. S.F. Naguiat, Inc.* (G.R. No. 165544, October 2, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of Samonte's petition for certiorari against the RTC's denial of his Petition for Relief from Judgment.

**Facts:**

*   S.F. Naguiat, Inc. (Naguiat) sued S.B. Commercial Traders, Inc. (SB Traders) and its President/GM, Romeo Samonte (Samonte), for collection of sum of money (P1,105,143.27) due to unpaid Mobil Oil products.
*   Naguiat alleged SB Traders was Samonte's alter ego, making him solidarily liable.
*   Samonte and his counsel failed to appear at pre-trial. The RTC allowed Naguiat to present evidence ex parte.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Naguiat, holding SB Traders and Samonte jointly and severally liable, plus interest, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   Samonte did not appeal. Instead, filed a Petition for Relief from Judgment, arguing the RTC erred in holding him personally liable for SB Traders' obligations.
*   RTC denied the Petition for Relief from Judgment, a decision upheld by the CA.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Joint and Several Liability:** RTC initially imposed joint and several liability on Samonte for SB Traders' debt.  This is a core point of contention.
*   **Payment of Debt:**  SB Traders has the primary obligation to pay Naguiat for the purchased products (P1,105,143.27), plus interest.
*   **Payment of Damages:** The RTC also awarded Naguiat exemplary damages and attorney's fees, obligations now attached to both SB Traders and Samonte.
*  **Rule 38, Rules of Court:**  The entire case hinges on the proper application (or lack thereof) of this Rule concerning Relief from Judgment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Romeo Samonte:** Initially held jointly and severally liable for SB Traders' debt.  His attempt to be relieved of this liability via Rule 38 was unsuccessful.
*   **S.B. Commercial Traders, Inc.:** Primarily liable for the debt.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Alter Ego Doctrine:** The central risk is whether Naguiat can successfully pierce the corporate veil and hold Samonte personally liable. This depends on establishing that SB Traders was a mere alter ego of Samonte.  The document doesn't provide details about the evidence presented on this point.
*   **Procedural Default:** Samonte's failure to appear at pre-trial and failure to file a timely appeal are fatal flaws.
*   **Improper Use of Rule 38:** The SC correctly points out that a Petition for Relief from Judgment is not a substitute for an appeal. Samonte attempted to use Rule 38 to correct alleged errors of law, which is inappropriate. *Agan v. Heirs of Sps. Andres Nueva and Diosdada Nueva, G.R. No. 155018, December 11, 2003, 418 SCRA 421, 426*,
*   **Lack of Affidavit of Merit/Verification:** The lack of a proper affidavit of merit (or even a verified petition) further weakens Samonte's case under Rule 38.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 38, Sections 1 and 3, Rules of Court:**  The statutory basis for Petition for Relief from Judgment.  Cited for requirements regarding time limits, contents, and affidavits.
*   **Ibabao v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. L-74848, May 20, 1987, 150 SCRA 76, 86:** Provides that relief from judgment is only available in exceptional cases with no other remedies.
*   **Agan v. Heirs of Sps. Andres Nueva and Diosdada Nueva, G.R. No. 155018, December 11, 2003, 418 SCRA 421, 426:** Establishes the principle that "mistake" in Rule 38 refers to mistake of fact, not law.
*   **Saint Louis University v. Cordero, G.R. No. 144118, July 21, 2004, 434 SCRA 575:** Reinforces the importance of strict compliance with procedural rules.
*   **Principles of Corporate Law (Alter Ego Doctrine):** Although not explicitly mentioned in the Supreme Court's disposition, the underlying issue is based on the principle that a corporation possesses a distinct and separate legal personality from its officers and stockholders. This principle is not absolute, and it is not applicable when the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is warranted.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the alter ego doctrine depends on the facts and evidence presented. Without seeing the evidence presented at the RTC level, it's impossible to definitively assess the strength of Naguiat's alter ego claim.

**Conclusion:**

Samonte's petition is without merit due to procedural missteps and his attempt to misuse the remedy of Petition for Relief from Judgment.  The CA's decision upholding the RTC's denial was correct. The key challenge for the respondent will be successfully executing the judgment against Samonte by proving he is indeed an alter ego of SB Commercial Traders, Inc.
