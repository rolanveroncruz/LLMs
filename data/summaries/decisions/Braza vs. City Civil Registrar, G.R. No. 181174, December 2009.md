**Case Summary: Braza v. City Civil Registrar of Himamaylan City, G.R. No. 181174 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review of RTC dismissal of a petition for correction of entries in the birth record of Patrick Alvin Titular Braza. The petitioners (Ma. Cristina Braza et al., the legitimate wife and children of Pablo Braza) sought to: (1) correct Patrick's birth certificate to remove entries related to his legitimation and acknowledge of Pablo as his father, (2) compel DNA testing of Patrick, and (3) declare Pablo's marriage to Lucille Titular as bigamous.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioners' Argument:** Petitioners argued that the RTC could rule on the validity of marriage and legitimacy in an action for correction of entries under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court. They cited *Cari単o v. Cari単o*, *Lee v. Court of Appeals*, and *Republic v. Kho* to support the argument that substantial errors can be corrected under Rule 108.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, holding that a special proceeding under Rule 108 is limited to correcting clerical or innocuous errors. It lacks jurisdiction to nullify marriages, rule on legitimacy, or order DNA testing. The core of petitioners' claim is not mere correction of entries, but an attack on the validity of the marriage between Pablo and Lucille and an attempt to impugn Patrick's legitimacy, which are properly filed in a family court.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   No obligations or liabilities were created in this case. It primarily addressed a procedural issue regarding the appropriate venue and type of action.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Collateral Attack on Marriage/Legitimacy:** The Court emphasized the doctrinal principle that the validity of marriages and legitimacy can only be questioned in a *direct* action, not through a collateral attack such as a petition under Rule 108. The main risk would be trying to address the marriage and legitimacy issues under an inappropriate method.
*   **Procedural Error:** Filing in the wrong court (RTC acting not as a family court) resulted in dismissal without prejudice, delaying resolution of the underlying issues.
*   **DNA Testing:** The Court did not address the substantive merits of ordering DNA testing, only stating the RTC lacked jurisdiction within the confines of a Rule 108 proceeding to order it.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 108 of the Rules of Court:** Governs cancellation or correction of entries in the original registry.
*   **Art. 412 of the Civil Code:** Concerns changing entries in a civil registrar.
*   **A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC:** Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages.
*   **Art. 171 of the Family Code:** Pertains to impugning the filiation of a child.
*   **Cari単o v. Cari単o (G.R. No. 132529):** Addressed validity of marriage in the context of death benefits.
*   **Lee v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 118387):** Addressed establishing absence of a mother-child relationship
*   **Republic v. Kho (G.R. No. 170340):** Addressed correction of birth records regarding legitimacy and citizenship.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Determination of the "main cause of action":** The petitioners argued their main cause of action was the correction of entries, with other prayers incidental. The Court disagreed, finding that the principal aim was to invalidate the marriage and impugn legitimacy. This distinction significantly impacts the applicable procedure and jurisdiction.

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the importance of choosing the correct legal remedy and venue. Attempting to use a simplified procedure (Rule 108) to address complex family law issues (validity of marriage, legitimacy) is improper. A direct action in a family court is required to address such claims.
