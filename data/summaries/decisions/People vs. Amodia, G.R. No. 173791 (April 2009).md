Here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Pablo Amodia*, G.R. No. 173791, April 7, 2009

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court affirmed with modifications the Court of Appeals' decision finding Pablo Amodia guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Crime:** Murder, qualified by abuse of superior strength (Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code).
*   **Facts:** Pablo Amodia, along with three others (Damaso Amodia, George Palacio, and Arnold Partosa), was accused of killing Felix Olandria.  Two eyewitnesses, Romildo Ceno and Luther Caberte, positively identified Pablo as being part of the group that attacked the victim. The victim was held by Pablo and Arnold while George struck him and Damaso stabbed him.
*   **Defense:** Alibi. Pablo claimed to be at his brother's house, which was corroborated by his sister Elma Amodia Romero.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Conviction:** Pablo Amodia is guilty as a principal by conspiracy for Murder.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Damages:**
    *   Civil Indemnity: Increased from P50,000 to P75,000.
    *   Moral Damages: P50,000.
    *   Exemplary Damages: P25,000.
    *   Temperate Damages: P25,000 (in lieu of the actual damages).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** Reliance on eyewitness testimony is always subject to scrutiny, although the court found it credible in this case due to proximity, lighting, and familiarity.  Inconsistencies in the witness testimony might be considered to mitigate any points made.
*   **Alibi:** Alibi is a weak defense and requires an accurate timeline of events, and the prosecution's presented timeline of the events was more probable than the defense's.
*   **Conspiracy:**  While there was no explicit agreement to commit the crime proven, the court inferred conspiracy from the concerted actions of the accused, specifically the acts of holding the victim while he was attacked. If there was no intention for the accused to be involved, then they would have had to have let go of the victim when attacked.
*   **Abuse of Superior Strength:**  The court found this aggravating circumstance present due to the numerical advantage of the assailants and the manner in which they incapacitated the victim before the fatal stabbing.
