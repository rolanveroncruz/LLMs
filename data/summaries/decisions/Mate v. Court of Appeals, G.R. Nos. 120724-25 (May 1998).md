**Legal Document Summary: *Mate v. Court of Appeals and Tan***

This Supreme Court decision affirms the Court of Appeals' ruling, upholding the validity of a *Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase* (pacto de retro sale) between Fernando Mate (petitioner) and Inocencio Tan (respondent). The court compels Mate to consolidate ownership of the properties in favor of Tan and orders Mate to pay Tan attorney's fees.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase:** The core agreement involved the transfer of ownership of three lots from Mate to Tan with a stipulated repurchase period.
*   **Consideration:** The court found valid consideration despite Mate not directly receiving the P1.4 million from Tan. The accommodation of Josefina Rey, potential avoidance of criminal prosecution for her, and receipt of P420,000 were deemed sufficient consideration.
*   **Consolidation of Ownership:** Due to the expiration of the repurchase period, ownership was consolidated in favor of Tan by operation of law.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Mate:** Obligated to transfer titles to Tan, ordered to pay attorney fees
*   **Tan:** (None)

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The core argument hinged on the validity of the pacto de retro sale, with Mate claiming lack of consideration due to dishonored checks issued by a third party (Rey). The Court rejected this argument, highlighting Mate's role in creating the situation.
*   The allegation of deception was refuted, with the Court noting Mate, as a lawyer, should have understood the risks involved. The court also points out the equitable maxim: the one who made it possible for the wrong to be done should be the one to bear the resulting loss
*   Ambiguity: This document doesn't specify any obligations on Tan
*   No contentious clauses identified

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   Cited case law: *Singson vs. Isabela Sawmill*, 88 SCRA 633, 643, a case regarding innocent parties suffering and who must bear the consequences. *Bacaltos Coal Mines vs. Court of Appeals*, 245 SCRA 460, a case regarding the maxim that one who made it possible for the wrong to be done should be the one to bear the resulting loss.
*   Implied Statutory Reference: The decision touches upon principles related to contract law (essential elements of contracts) and *pacto de retro* sales as defined under the Civil Code.
*   B.P. 22 (law on bouncing checks)

**Overall Assessment:**

The court sided with Tan, enforcing the pacto de retro agreement. Mate, despite being a lawyer, was found to have created the conditions leading to his loss. The key takeaway is the importance of due diligence and understanding the risks involved in contractual agreements, especially when involving third parties.
