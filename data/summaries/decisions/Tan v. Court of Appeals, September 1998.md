## Legal Document Summary: *Tan vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125861 (1998)*

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that reversed the trial court's dismissal of a complaint for recovery of property.

**Key Issue:** Whether the complaint states a cause of action for recovery of property based on an implied trust and whether such action has prescribed or is barred by laches.

**Facts (as alleged in the complaint):**

*   Fernando Tan Kiat (Respondent) claims he bought property from Alejandro Tan Keh in 1954 but couldn't register it due to foreign nationality. Alejandro Tan Keh transferred possession and executed a 40-year lease in Respondent's favor.
*   In 1958, Alejandro Tan Keh sold the property to Remigio Tan (father of Petitioners), allegedly with an understanding that it was held in trust for Respondent. A new lease was also executed for 40 years.
*   Remigio Tan died in 1968, and Petitioners allegedly promised to transfer the property to Respondent, who had by then acquired Filipino citizenship.
*   Petitioners subsequently transferred the property to their names.

**Petitioners' Arguments (Motion to Dismiss):**

*   Complaint fails to state a cause of action.
*   Cause of action has prescribed.
*   Cause of action is barred by prior judgment.
*   Claim has been waived, abandoned, or extinguished by laches and estoppel.

**Court's Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and dismissed Respondent's complaint.

**Key Provisions and Legal Analysis:**

*   **Cause of Action/Implied Trust:** The court rejected the "trust theory" because:
    *   **Lease Agreement:** The lease agreement between Remigio Tan and Respondent estopped Respondent from claiming ownership, citing Art. 1436, Civil Code, Section 2, Rule 131 of the Rules of Court, and cases like *Pascual v. Angeles*.
    *   **Mortgage:** Remigio Tan mortgaged the property, indicating ownership, referencing Art. 2085, Civil Code (mortgagor must be absolute owner).
    *   **Double Sale:** The Court viewed the situation as a double sale, applying Article 1544 of the Civil Code, giving preference to Remigio Tan who registered his title first. *Santiago v. CA* supported this position.
    *   **Dead Man's Statute:** Respondent would have to rely on parol evidence, which is barred by Section 23, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court.

*   **Prescription:** The ten-year prescriptive period for reconveyance based on implied trust (Art. 1144, Civil Code) applies. *Heirs of Jose Olviga v. CA* exception for those in possession is not applicable as the respondent possession was not in the concept of an owner (Art. 1118, Civil Code, *"Possession has to be in the concept of an owner, public, peaceful and uninterrupted."*), but a lessee (Art. 1119). The complaint was filed 35 years after TCT No. 53284 was registered in the name of Remigio Tan.

*   **Laches:** Respondent delayed too long in asserting his rights (30 years after gaining citizenship). *Quinsay v. IAC* supports this.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Evidence of Initial Sale:** The lack of documented evidence of the initial sale between Alejandro Tan Keh and Respondent is a significant weakness. The Court gives weight to registered land titles.
*   **Nature of the Lease:** The Respondent alleged that no payment or demand for rental was ever made. This could be a strong indication of a lease not being bona fide, thus casting doubt on the Petitioner's claim of possessing the property as a lessee.
*   **"Understanding" of Trust:** The alleged "understanding" between Alejandro Tan Keh and Remigio Tan regarding the trust is difficult to prove without strong evidence.
*   **Good Faith:** The Court mentions "good faith" in the context of double sale. However, if Remigio Tan knew about the prior sale to Respondent, his registration might not be in good faith, potentially altering the outcome.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 1436, Civil Code (estoppel of lessee)
*   Section 2, Rule 131, Rules of Court (conclusive presumption of landlord's title)
*   Article 2085, Civil Code (requisites of mortgage)
*   Article 1544, Civil Code (double sale)
*   Section 23, Rule 130, Rules of Court (Dead Man's Statute)
*   Article 1144, Civil Code (prescription)
*   Article 1118, Civil Code (Possession in the concept of an owner)
*   Article 1119, Civil Code (Acts of possessory character executed in virtue of license)
