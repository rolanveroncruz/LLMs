## Legal Document Summary: *Licyayo v. People*, G.R. No. 169425 (2008)

**Nature of Document:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Roberto Licyayo for Homicide (Art. 249, Revised Penal Code).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Licyayo was charged with Homicide (Crim. Case No. 819) and Direct Assault (Crim. Case No. 820). The latter was dismissed due to lack of arraignment.
*   **Factual Basis:** Licyayo stabbed Rufino Guay during a brawl after an evening of drinking. The incident stemmed from an altercation between the victim and Licyayo's brother.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Convicted Licyayo of Homicide, acquitted co-accused due to lack of conspiracy, and ordered him to pay civil indemnity (₱50,000) and moral damages (₱50,000).
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision with modifications, adding temperate damages (₱25,000) and indemnity for lost earnings (₱580,050).

**Petitioner's Arguments:**

1.  **Defective Information:** The Information was insufficient because it did not explicitly mention Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code.
2.  **Mitigating Circumstances:** Sufficient provocation (victim allegedly initiated the assault) and intoxication.

**Court's Rationale & Holdings:**

*   **Sufficiency of Information:** The Court, citing *People v. Gatchalian* (104 Phil. 664), held that the Information was sufficient as it designated the offense as Homicide and averred the acts constituting the offense. Failure to cite Art. 249 did not render it defective. The recital of facts adequately apprised the accused of the accusation.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:**
    *   **Provocation:** Rejected. Evidence was inconclusive regarding who initiated the brawl. The burden to prove provocation rests on the accused (*Bacar v. De Guzman, Jr.*, 338 Phil. 41).
    *   **Intoxication:** Rejected. Licyayo failed to prove that the intoxication impaired his willpower and understanding. Recalling details of the incident demonstrated control of his mental faculties. Mere testimony that he was drunk is insufficient.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion temporal (Art. 249). Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the imposed sentence of 8 years *prision mayor* as minimum to 15 years *reclusion temporal* as maximum was upheld.
*   **Damages:**
    *   **Civil Indemnity:** ₱50,000 (affirmed, per jurisprudence: *People v. Tabuelog*).
    *   **Moral Damages:** ₱50,000 (affirmed, per jurisprudence).
    *   **Temperate Damages:** ₱25,000 (affirmed, justified where actual damages are unproven: Art. 2224, Civil Code).
    *   **Loss of Earning Capacity:** ₱580,050 (affirmed, calculated using the formula for net earning capacity). The Court noted that testimonial evidence of income sufficed because the victim was self-employed and earned less than the minimum wage (*People v. Foncardas*, 466 Phil. 992).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The reliance on testimonial evidence for loss of earning capacity, despite potential challenges to its accuracy, could be a point of contention.
*   The dismissal of the Direct Assault charge (Crim. Case No. 820) due to lack of arraignment suggests a possible procedural lapse.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code: Art. 13, Art. 148, Art. 249
*   Civil Code: Art. 2206, Art. 2224
*   Rules of Criminal Procedure: Rule 110, Sec. 6 & 8
*   Indeterminate Sentence Law
*   *People v. Gatchalian*, 104 Phil. 664 (sufficiency of information)
*   *Olivarez v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 163866 (2005)
*   *Bacar v. De Guzman, Jr.*, 338 Phil. 41 (provocation as mitigating circumstance)
*   *People v. Foncardas*, 466 Phil. 992 (testimonial evidence of income)
*   *People v. Tabuelog*, G.R. No. 178059 (2008) (civil indemnity)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, upholding Licyayo's conviction for Homicide and the corresponding award of damages. The Court found the Information sufficient, and rejected the claims of mitigating circumstances. This case reinforces the requirements for alleging a crime in an Information and the burden of proof for establishing mitigating circumstances.
