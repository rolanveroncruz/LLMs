## Legal Document Summary: *A.C. No. 7820, September 12, 2008*

**Case Name:** *Atty. Ricardo M. Salomon, Jr. v. Atty. Joselito C. Frial*

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in an administrative case concerning attorney misconduct.

**Key Issue:** Whether Atty. Frial committed professional misconduct concerning his custody of attached vehicles.

**Facts:**

*   Complainant, Atty. Salomon, filed a complaint against Respondent, Atty. Frial, alleging violation of the Lawyer's Oath and gross misconduct.
*   Civil Case No. 05-111825 saw a writ of preliminary attachment issued in favor of Atty. Frial's client, Lucy Lo, against Atty. Salomon's vehicles (Volvo & Nissan).
*   Instead of court deposit, the sheriff turned over the vehicles to Atty. Frial.
*   Complainant alleged misuse of the Nissan and questioned the Volvo's destruction by fire while in Atty. Frial's custody.
*   Atty. Frial admitted taking custody without court authority, claiming vehicle issues and denying personal use, but admitted authorizing access to the Nissan. He also admitted the Volvo's destruction by fire while in his custody without informing the court.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Custody of Attached Property:** Atty. Frial assumed responsibility for preserving the vehicles' value pending the civil case's outcome. This created an obligation to safeguard the vehicles.
*   **Canon 11, Canons of Professional Ethics:** Lawyers must avoid actions for personal gain that abuse client confidence and trust property. They are obligated to account for trust property (in this case, attached property) and not commingle it.
*   **Officer of the Court:** Lawyers must respect court orders and processes, in particular, the writ of attachment.
*   **Duty to Inform:** Atty. Frial failed to inform the court or the sheriff of the Volvo's destruction.

**Liabilities & Sanctions:**

*   **Grave Misconduct and Infidelity in Custody of Properties in *Custodia Legis***: Found guilty on both counts.
*   **Suspension:** Suspended from the practice of law for one (1) year.
*   **Potential Civil Liability:** The court noted the availability of legal recourse for recovering the Volvo's value from Atty. Frial.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity:** The court found no direct evidence of Atty. Frial using the Nissan Sentra, yet held him liable for its unauthorized use by others.
*   **Presumption:** The court makes an inference that whoever drove the Nissan received the key from Atty. Frial.
*   **Justification:** Atty. Frial provided possible justification for the vehicle sightings, the court does not give much weight to his explanation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Olib v. Pastoral, G.R. No. 81120, August 20, 1990, 188 SCRA 692, 699:** Defines the purpose of a writ of attachment (prevention of disposal of property).
*   **Saquing v. Mora, A.C. No. 6678, October 9, 2006, 504 SCRA 1, 7; Bantolo v. Castillon, Jr., A.C. No. 6589, December 19, 2005, 478 SCRA 443, 449:** Sets the standard for disbarment (serious misconduct).
*   **Canon 11 of the Canons of Professional Ethics**: Details the obligations of lawyers with respect to trust property.

**Conclusion:**

Atty. Frial's unauthorized possession and negligence in handling attached vehicles, particularly the failure to disclose the Volvo's destruction, constituted grave misconduct and infidelity in handling properties in *custodia legis*. The imposed sanction is suspension for one year, balanced against the higher standard of disbarment. A potential civil suit for recovery of the damaged Volvo's value remains.
