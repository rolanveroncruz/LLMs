**Legal Document Summary: *Panuncio v. People*, G.R. No. 165678 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Rosario S. Panuncio for falsification of a public document under Article 172(1) in relation to Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Falsification:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed Panuncio's conviction, finding the elements of falsification under Art. 172(1) in relation to Art. 171 of the RPC to be established. Specifically, Panuncio, a private individual, falsified a Land Transportation Office (LTO) Motor Vehicle Registration Receipt (MVRR) No. 63231478. The falsification involved altering information to make it appear the document was issued for a different vehicle, changing the meaning of the document within the context of Article 171(6) of the RPC.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The MVRR, though a photocopy, was admissible. The SC dismissed the argument that a photocopy could not be falsified, highlighting that it was presented to traffic enforcers to appear that a public vehicle was validly and lawfully registered and the original was in the possession of Panuncio. The original copy of MVRR No. 63231478 was not presented during the trial because petitioner kept it in her possession.
*   **Validity of Search & Seizure:** The SC upheld the validity of the search warrant and the subsequent seizure of evidence. The search was conducted in compliance with Section 8, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court (presence of two witnesses of sufficient age and discretion). Panuncio's claim of being forced to sign documents was unsubstantiated. Therefore, the evidence obtained during the search was deemed admissible.
*   **Defective Information:** The SC dismissed Panuncioâ€™s argument that the Information was defective as it did not specifically mention the provision that she violated. By failing to file a Motion for Bill of Particulars or Motion to Quash prior to entering a plea, she waived the defect in the information. *People v. Almendral, G.R. No. 126025 (2004)*.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL):** The SC modified the CA's application of the ISL. The CA imposed a penalty of two (2) years and four (4) months of *prision correccional* as minimum to six (6) years of *prision correccional* as maximum. The SC lowered the maximum penalty to four (4) years, nine (9) months, and eleven (11) days of *prision correccional*. The SC included a fine of P3,000, which the CA had omitted.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Panuncio is criminally liable for falsification of a public document under Article 172(1) in relation to Article 171 of the RPC.
*   She is sentenced to imprisonment from two (2) years and four (4) months of *prision correccional* as minimum to four (4) years, nine (9) months, and eleven (11) days of *prision correccional* as maximum.
*   She is liable to pay a fine of P3,000.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The prosecution's case relies heavily on the presence of the falsified document in Panuncio's residence and her connection to Manlite. A potential argument could be made that the evidence is insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she personally committed the act of falsification.
*   **Search Warrant Execution:** Although the Court found the search warrant to be valid, any deviations from the proper execution procedure (Section 8, Rule 126) could potentially render the evidence inadmissible, based on Article III, Section 3(2) of the Constitution. *People v. Sarap, 447 Phil. 642 (2003)*.
*   **"Alteration or Intercalation" - Art. 171(6) RPC:** An argument could be made that alteration of data on owner's copy is not considered an alteration or intercalation that changes its meaning.
