**Case:** *Philippine Airlines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, Ferdinand Pineda and Godofredo Cabling*, G.R. No. 120567, March 20, 1998.

**Summary:**

Philippine Airlines (PAL) filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, assailing the NLRC's issuance of a mandatory injunction ordering PAL to reinstate flight stewards Pineda and Cabling after their dismissal for alleged currency smuggling. The core issue is whether the NLRC has the authority to issue such an injunction *before* an illegal dismissal complaint is filed before the Labor Arbiter.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **NLRC Order:** The NLRC issued a temporary mandatory injunction ordering PAL to cease enforcing its dismissal orders against Pineda and Cabling and reinstate them. This was based on the NLRC's finding of grave and irreparable injury to the employees and the potential illegality of PAL's Code of Discipline (due to lack of employee participation in its formulation, citing *PAL, Inc. vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 85985*).
*   **Article 218(e) of the Labor Code:** The NLRC invoked this provision as granting it the power to issue injunctions in labor disputes to prevent grave or irreparable damage.
*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** PAL argued that the NLRC lacked jurisdiction to issue the injunction because no illegal dismissal case had been filed with the Labor Arbiter.
*   **Labor Arbiter Jurisdiction:** Article 217(a) of the Labor Code confers original and exclusive jurisdiction to Labor Arbiters over termination disputes and related claims.
*   **Reinstatement & Backwages (Article 279, Labor Code):** This provision outlines the remedies available to illegally dismissed employees.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **PAL:** The initial risk was the obligation to reinstate employees and potentially pay backwages if the NLRC order was valid. This risk is mitigated by the Supreme Court ruling.
*   **NLRC:** The NLRC faces potential liability for exceeding its jurisdiction and issuing an injunction without a proper predicate case before the Labor Arbiter.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 217(a) of the Labor Code:** Grants Labor Arbiters original and exclusive jurisdiction over termination disputes.
*   **Article 218(e) of the Labor Code:** Grants NLRC the power to issue injunctions in "labor disputes."
*   **Article 279 of the Labor Code:** Defines remedies for illegal dismissal.
*   ***PAL, Inc. vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 85985*:** Relevant regarding the validity of PAL's Code of Discipline.
*   ***Chemo-Technische Mfg., Inc. Employees Union-DFA, et.al. vs. Chemo-Technische Mfg., Inc., et.al., G.R. No. 107031*:** The NLRC misinterpreted this case as upholding its power to issue injunctions; the Supreme Court clarified it simply denied a petition as premature.
*  ***Pondoc vs. National Labor Relations Commission, 262 SCRA 632, 638 [1996].:*** reiterates that the power of Labor Arbiters to issue the foregoing ancillary power may be exercised by the Labor Arbiters only as an incident to the cases pending before them in order to preserve the rights of the parties during the pendency of the case, but excluding labor disputes involving strikes or lockout

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Labor Dispute" Definition:** The NLRC argued that the dismissal itself created a labor dispute, justifying its intervention. The Supreme Court rejected this.
*   **"Adequate Remedy at Law":** The NLRC argued that filing an illegal dismissal case with the Labor Arbiter was not an "adequate" remedy, justifying the injunction. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the legal remedies outlined in Article 279 are adequate.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversing the NLRC's orders. The Court held that the NLRC exceeded its jurisdiction by issuing an injunction before an illegal dismissal complaint was filed with the Labor Arbiter. The Court emphasized that the Labor Arbiter has original and exclusive jurisdiction over termination disputes and that Article 218(e) does not grant the NLRC a blanket authority to issue injunctions absent a pending labor dispute. The Court also found the remedies available to the private respondents legally adequate. The injunction should have been requested from the Arbiter once a case had been established.
