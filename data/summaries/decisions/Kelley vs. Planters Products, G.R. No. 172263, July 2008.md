**Case:** *Spouses Auther G. Kelley, Jr. and Doris A. Kelley vs. Planters Products, Inc. and Jorge A. Ragutana* G.R. No. 172263, July 9, 2008 (579 Phil. 763)

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over the execution sale of a property claimed as the family home of Spouses Kelley. PPI obtained a judgment against Auther Kelley in Civil Case No. 91-904 for a sum of money due to unpaid consignment of agricultural products.  Pursuant to a writ of execution, respondent sheriff Ragutana sold the property covered by TCT No. 15079.  Spouses Kelley subsequently filed Civil Case No. 2000-0188 in Naga City to nullify the levy and sale, arguing it was their family home. The Naga City RTC dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and lack of cause of action, which was upheld by the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court partially granted the petition, remanding the case to the Naga City RTC for a determination of whether the property was a duly constituted family home.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Family Home Exemption:**  The core issue is whether the property is a family home exempt from execution under Article 152 et seq. of the Family Code. This hinges on whether it was duly constituted, the date of constitution, actual residency, and the value limitations.

*   **Conditions for Family Home:** The family home must be constituted jointly by husband and wife or by an unmarried head of a family, be the actual residence, and fall within the value limits outlined in Article 157 of the Family Code.  For homes constituted after August 3, 1988, constitution is by operation of law (Article 162 of the Family Code).

*   **Exceptions to Family Home Exemption:**  The family home is *not* exempt in specific circumstances listed in Article 155 of the Family Code.  This is critical:
    *   Non-payment of taxes
    *   Debts incurred *prior* to the constitution of the family home
    *   Debts secured by a mortgage on the premises
    *   Debts due to laborers/materialmen.
    *   Article 160 provides a procedural mechanism for creditors to execute on family homes exceeding the maximum allowed value.

*   **Jurisdiction**: The Court addressed the jurisdictional question, citing *Gomez v. Sta. Ines* (G.R. No. 132537, 14 October 2005, 473 SCRA 25, 38). Since Doris Kelley was not a party to the original Makati RTC case, she could file a separate action to protect her claim on the property.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **PPI's Potential Liability:** If the RTC Naga City determines the property is a valid family home and the debt does not fall under the Article 155 exceptions, the execution sale will be declared void. PPI would have to pursue other means of collecting the debt.
*   **Spouses Kelley's Burden of Proof:** Spouses Kelley bear the burden of proving that the property is a duly constituted family home and that the debt was incurred *after* August 3, 1988 (or that it was constituted under the Civil Code if the debt predates the Family Code).
*   **Value of the Property:** If the property's value exceeds the limits set by Article 157 of the Family Code, PPI can seek an order for its sale under Article 160, subject to the prescribed procedure.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code:** Articles 152, 155, 156, 157, 160, and 162 are central to determining the family home status and its exceptions.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 39, Sec. 13 (a):** General exemption of the family home.
*   **Gomez v. Sta. Ines:** Affirms the right of third-party claimants to litigate their claims in a separate action.
*   **Manacop v. CA, 342 Phil. 735, 742 (1997):** Existing family residences are considered family homes under the Family Code.
*   **Modequillo v. Breva, G.R. No. 86355, 31 May 1990, 185 SCRA 766, 771:** The exemption is effective from the time of constitution.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Date of Constitution:**  Determining the precise date of the "constitution" of the family home is crucial, particularly if the debt predates the Family Code. Evidence of intent to constitute a family home prior to 1988 may be necessary if the debt predates it.
*   **Valuation:** Determining the actual value of the family home "at the time of its constitution" (for purposes of Article 157) could be contentious.
*   **Residency:** The requirement of "actual residence" is a factual issue that will require evidence. Temporary absences or abandonment may be raised.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   **For PPI:** Focus on proving that the debt was incurred *before* the family home was constituted, that the property's value exceeds the legal limits, or that one of the other exceptions under Article 155 applies.
*   **For Spouses Kelley:** Meticulously document the date of acquisition, establishment of residence, intent to constitute a family home (if debt is pre-Family Code), and current value of the property to stay within the limits. Collect evidence of residency (utility bills, voter registration, etc.)
