## Legal Document Summary: *Komatsu Industries (Phils.) Inc. v. Court of Appeals, et al.*, G.R. No. 127682

**Nature:** Resolution denying Petitioner's Second Motion for Reconsideration, affirming the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision which reversed the trial court and upheld the validity of the extrajudicial foreclosure.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Validity of Foreclosure:** The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the CA's ruling that the extrajudicial foreclosure of Komatsu's property by PNB was valid. The CA correctly determined that the 1981 Deed of Release executed solely by NIDC (Philippine National Development Corporation) did not release the real estate mortgage in favor of PNB under the 1978 Amendment of Mortgage Deed.
*   **Relativity of Contracts:** The Deed of Release was not binding on PNB as PNB was not a signatory and did not ratify it (Art. 1311, Civil Code).
*   **Indivisibility of Mortgage:** The SC affirmed the indivisibility of the mortgage, meaning partial payment to NIDC did not extinguish the entire mortgage (Art. 2089, Civil Code). The CA correctly distinguished *Central Bank of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals* (139 SCRA 46).
*   **Amendment of Mortgage Deed Valid:** The SC agreed with the CA that the "Amendment of Mortgage Deed" executed by Komatsu, PNB and NIDC was valid and covered the credit accommodations obtained by Komatsu with NIDC AND another obligation arising from the establishment of a deferred letter of credit for US$1,564,826.00
*   **Minute Resolutions:** The SC reiterated the validity of using "minute resolutions" (citing *Novino, et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.* G.R. Nos. L-21098, May 31, 1963, 8 SCRA 279, *Que vs. People, et al.*, G.R. Nos. L-75217-18, September 21, 1987, 154 SCRA 160, *Munal vs. Commission on Audit, et al.*, G.R. No. 78648, January 24, 1989, 169 SCRA 356 *Borromeo vs. Court of Appeals, et al.*, G.R. No. 82273, June 1, 1990, 186 SCRA 1) to dispose of cases, emphasizing they are adjudications on the merits, especially when the CA's decision is correct.

**Obligations:**

*   Komatsu is obligated to recognize the validity of the extrajudicial foreclosure and the transfer of title to PNB and subsequently to Santiago Land Development Corporation (SLDC).
*   No further obligation is imposed on PNB or SLDC.

**Liabilities:**

*   Komatsu is liable for the remaining debt to PNB.
*   Komatsu is not entitled to damages (damnum absque injuria).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Accusations of Judicial Irregularity:** Komatsu's unverified accusations against the CA and SC justices pose a risk of contempt or other sanctions if pursued without proof.
*   **Redemption Period:** The issue of redemption was raised late in the proceedings. The period of redemption has expired (Certificate of Sale registered on May 17, 1984). Komatsu assigned their right to redeem the property as early as April 17, 1985.
*   **Rehashed Arguments:** The SC explicitly noted Komatsuâ€™s repetition of previous arguments, indicating a lack of novel legal points.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Art. 1311 (Relativity of Contracts), Art. 2089 (Indivisibility of Mortgage), Civil Code
*   *Novino, et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.* G.R. Nos. L-21098, May 31, 1963, 8 SCRA 279

*   *Central Bank of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals* (139 SCRA 46) (distinguished)

**Ambiguities & Contentions:**

*   The main point of contention is whether the Deed of Release from NIDC discharged PNB's mortgage as well. The Court found that it did not.

**Overall Assessment:**

The resolution is a strong affirmation of the CA's decision and a rejection of Komatsu's repeated attempts to overturn the foreclosure. The Court criticizes Komatsu's tactics and reiterates established legal principles. Further appeals are unlikely to succeed, and pursuing accusations of judicial misconduct without evidence carries significant risk.
