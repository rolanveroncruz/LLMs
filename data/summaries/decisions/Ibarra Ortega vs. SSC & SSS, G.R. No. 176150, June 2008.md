## Legal Document Summary: *Ortega v. Social Security Commission and Social Security System*

**Case:** *Ibarra P. Ortega v. Social Security Commission and Social Security System*, G.R. No. 176150, June 25, 2008.

**Nature:** Appeal (initially filed as both certiorari under Rule 65 and petition for review under Rule 45, ultimately treated as a petition for review under Rule 45).

**Key Issue:** Whether Petitioner is entitled to total permanent disability benefits from the SSS.

**Holding:**  Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the Court of Appeals' decision which affirmed the Social Security Commission's (SSC) denial of Petitioner's claim for total permanent disability benefits.  The denial is without prejudice to the filing of a new application by petitioner based on his supervening claims anchored on Coronary Artery Disease 1VD and Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Procedural Issue:** The Supreme Court criticized the Petitioner's attempt to file a "two-headed" petition, combining Rule 45 (appeal) and Rule 65 (certiorari) remedies.  The Court emphasized these remedies are mutually exclusive, citing *Nagkahiusang Mamumuo sa PICOP Resources, Inc.- Southern Philippines Federation of Labor v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 148839-40, November 2, 2006, 506 SCRA 542 and *Ybañez v. Court of Appeals*, 323 Phil. 643 (1996).  The Court treated the case as a Rule 45 appeal despite initial missteps.

*   **Factual Questions:** The Court emphasized it's not a trier of fact and defers to findings of lower courts and administrative agencies, citing *Lazaro v. Social Security Commission*, 479 Phil. 384 (2004). The Court emphasized that findings of fact of administrative agencies and quasi-judicial bodies which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to specific matters are generally accorded not only respect but finality when affirmed by the Court of Appeals.

*   **Substantial Evidence:** The Court found substantial evidence supporting the denial based on multiple SSS physicians' examinations concluding no progression of Petitioner's initial disability (Generalized Arthritis and Partial Ankylosis).  The Court relied on the principle that a fact may be deemed established if it is supported by substantial evidence, or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion, citing *Rules of Court, Rule 133, Sec. 5*.

*   **SSS Law Requirements:** The Court noted that Petitioner's condition did not meet the criteria for total permanent disability under the Social Security Law (Sec. 13-A (d), (f)-(g) of the law).

*   **Distinction from Labor Code Claims:** The Court clarified that claims under the Labor Code for work-related disabilities differ from claims under the Social Security Law. Benefits under the Social Security Law are intended to provide insurance or protection against the hazards or risks of disability, sickness, old age or death, inter alia, irrespective of whether they arose from or in the course of the employment. The court cited *Valencia v. Manila Yacht Club, Inc.*, 138 Phil. 761, 764-765 (1969) when emphasizing this point.

*   **New Allegations on Appeal:** The Court refused to consider Petitioner's supervening claims of a heart attack, coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and hypertension, raised for the first time on appeal, citing *F.F. Marine Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission*.

**Potential Risks and Concerns:**

*   **Factual Determination of Disability:** The case highlights the difficulty in overturning factual determinations made by administrative agencies and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, especially when multiple medical opinions support the agency's decision.

*   **Importance of Pleading and Evidence:** The denial of consideration of new ailments raised on appeal underscores the critical importance of including all relevant medical conditions and evidence in the initial application and throughout the administrative proceedings. Failure to do so can result in the issue being waived.

*   **Interplay of Labor Code and Social Security Law:** The distinction between disability claims under the Labor Code and the Social Security Law is crucial. Different criteria and purposes govern each, requiring careful consideration when advising clients.

*   **Medical Evidence Threshold:** This case clarifies what constitutes substantial evidence in SSS disability claims.

*   Labor Code, Arts. 173, 192.
*   Rules of Court, Rule 45, Rule 65, Rule 133, Sec. 5.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "total permanent disability" under the Social Security Law can be contentious and fact-dependent. The phrase such cases as determined and approved by the SSS is broad.
*   The requirement of related deterioration under Sec. 13-A(g) can be a source of dispute when assessing relatedness.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The SSS has a statutory obligation to provide disability benefits under the Social Security Law, but this obligation is contingent upon meeting the prescribed conditions.
*   Members are obligated to comply with the requirements of the Social Security Law to qualify for benefits. They must prove their claims with substantial evidence.
