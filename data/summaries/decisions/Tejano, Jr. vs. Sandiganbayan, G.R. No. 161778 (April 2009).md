## Legal Document Summary: *Tejano v. Sandiganbayan* (G.R. No. 161778)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari challenging the Sandiganbayan's denial of Petitioner Tejano's Motion for New Trial after conviction for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 3(e), RA 3019:** Prohibits public officers from causing undue injury to any party, including the government, or giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of their official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.
*   **PNB Manual of Policies on Cash, COCI and Deposits Operations:** Cited by Petitioner as authorizing the encashment of checks. Specifically, Item "G" regarding out-of-town checks and the discretion of approving officers.
*   **Pre-Trial Order stipulations:** Establishes key facts, including Tejano's accommodation of the FEBTC check, its presence in the vault, and the cashier's note treating it as cash.
*   **PD 1606, Sec. 4 (amended by RA 8249) and Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Govern appeals from the Sandiganbayan to the Supreme Court, specifying the 15-day period for filing petitions for review on certiorari raising pure questions of law.
*   **Rule 121, Section 1 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure:** States that "the remedies of motion for reconsideration and motion for new trial may be availed of at any time before a judgment of conviction becomes final, which is within fifteen (15) days from the promulgation of the judgment."
*   **Rule 121, Section 2 of the Rules of Court:** Sets out the requirements for the Court to grant a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Tejano:** Convicted of violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019. Sandiganbayan found conspiracy between Tejano and co-accused Arancillo (at large). Sentenced to imprisonment.
*   **Fufunan:** Acquitted, found that her participation was merely administrative and lacked unity of purpose to commit the crime.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Judgment:** Sandiganbayan held the decision as final and executory due to Tejano's failure to timely file a petition for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court after denial of his Motion for Reconsideration. The motion for new trial was deemed filed out of time and did not toll the appeal period.
*   **No newly discovered evidence:** The evidence sought to be presented (Arancillo's testimony) did not meet the requirements of Rule 121, Section 2 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Appeal:** Petition for Certiorari dismissed because appeal was the proper remedy but was not timely availed of.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019, Sec. 3(e):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act violation.
*   **PD 1606, Sec. 4 (as amended by RA 8249):** Jurisdiction and procedure for appeals from the Sandiganbayan.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Petition for Review on Certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Rule 121 of the Rules of Court:** Governs motions for new trial in criminal proceedings.
*   ***Neypes v. Court of Appeals***: "Fresh Period Rule" allowing 15 days from the receipt of the denial of a motion for new trial.
*   ***Lubrica v. People of the Philippines***: Judgment becomes final upon expiration of the period without an appeal.
*   ***Dinglasan, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, et al***: Requirements for granting a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence under Section 2, Rule 121 of the Rules of Court.
*   ***Balanay v. Sandiganbayan***: Burden is on the accused to show that the new evidence he seeks to present has complied with the requisites to justify the holding of a new trial.
*   ***Republic v. Court of Appeals***: Remedies of appeal and certiorari are mutually exclusive and not alternative or successive.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The scope of "discretionary authority" afforded to Tejano as Manager and Vice-President of PNB under the bank's policies on cash and deposit operations.
*   Whether the "accommodation" of the FEBTC check constituted a violation of bank policy or simply an "unauthorized loan" to Arancillo, as argued by the prosecution.

**Summary:**

Tejano, convicted of violating RA 3019 Section 3(e), sought a new trial based on newly discovered evidence (co-accused Arancillo's potential testimony). The Sandiganbayan denied the motion, citing the finality of the judgment due to Tejano's failure to file a timely appeal to the Supreme Court and the lack of required showing for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The Supreme Court upheld the Sandiganbayan's decision, finding that Tejano failed to properly avail of the remedy of appeal.
