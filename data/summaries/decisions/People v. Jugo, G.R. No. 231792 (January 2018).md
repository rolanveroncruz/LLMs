Here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court decision:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Alvin Jugo y Villanueva*, G.R. No. 231792, January 29, 2018.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals' decision, acquitting Alvin Jugo y Villanueva of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), due to *significant breaches in the chain of custody*. The Court held that the prosecution failed to adequately justify non-compliance with Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), thereby compromising the integrity and evidentiary value of the *corpus delicti* (methamphetamine hydrochloride or *shabu*).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Section 5, Article II, R.A. 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs). Requires proving (a) identity of buyer, seller, object, consideration, (b) delivery and payment.

*   **Chain of Custody (Section 21, Article II, R.A. 9165):**  The Court emphasized the importance of an unbroken chain of custody to establish the identity of the seized drug with moral certainty. Section 21 requires immediate physical inventory and photography of seized items *immediately* after seizure and confiscation *in the presence* of: (a) the accused, (b) a representative from the media or the Department of Justice (DOJ), and (c) an elected public official.

*   **Critical Failures:**
    *   **Lack of Witness Presence During Inventory/Photography:** The inventory (Confiscation Receipt) and photography were not done in the presence of the accused or his representative, a DOJ/media representative, *or* an elected public official *at the time of preparation*. The barangay captain was only asked to sign *after* the fact. This is a direct violation of the requirements of Section 21.
    *   **Unjustified Non-Compliance:** The prosecution presented no credible explanation for the failure to comply with the witness requirements. This lack of justification is fatal to the prosecution's case.  The Court cannot presume justifiable grounds, they must be proven as fact.
    *   **Inconsistent Testimony:**  The testimony of SPO1 Villegas raised doubts regarding whether the Confiscation Receipt was prepared in an orderly manner.

*   **Saving Clause (IRR of R.A. 9165/R.A. 10640):**  While non-compliance with Section 21 may be excused if (a) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance, and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value are preserved, the prosecution failed to prove the former.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Section 5, Article II:**  Defines and penalizes illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **R.A. 9165, Section 21, Article II:**  Establishes the chain of custody rule for seized drugs.
*   **R.A. 10640:**  Amends Section 21 of R.A. 9165 (particularly regarding where the physical inventory and photography should take place, and clarifying the saving clause).
*   **Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002:** Defined "chain of custody."
*   **People v. Ceralde, G.R. No. 228894, August 7, 2017:**  (Cited extensively)  Reiterates the importance of strict compliance with Section 21 and the consequences of failure to do so.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Stressed the importance of insulating witness presence during seizure and marking to prevent evidence tampering.
*   **People v. Umipang, 686 Phil. 1024 (2012):**  Highlights that the procedure in Section 21 is a matter of *substantive law*.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   The police officers involved may face administrative scrutiny for failing to follow proper procedure.
*   The case serves as a strong reminder to law enforcement and prosecutors regarding the crucial importance of meticulously adhering to the requirements of Section 21 of R.A. 9165. Failure to do so can lead to the acquittal of defendants, regardless of guilt, and undermine the government's anti-drug campaign.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the "saving clause" in the IRR and R.A. 10640. While intended to provide flexibility in extraordinary circumstances, the Court's interpretation requires the prosecution to *actively prove* the existence of justifiable grounds for non-compliance, not merely assert them.
