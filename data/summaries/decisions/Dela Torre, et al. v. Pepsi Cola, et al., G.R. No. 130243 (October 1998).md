**Case Summary: *Dela Torre vs. Pepsi Cola Products, Phils., Inc.* (G.R. No. 130243, October 30, 1998)**

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the dismissal of complaints by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) due to plaintiffs' refusal to answer interrogatories.

**Facts:** Petitioners, holders of allegedly winning Pepsi bottle caps, sued Respondents (PCPPI and PI) for specific performance and damages after being denied prizes. Respondents filed interrogatories to determine Petitioners' eligibility to litigate as paupers. The RTC suspended proceedings for Petitioners to submit pauper status documentation. Petitioners failed to answer the interrogatories, believing the suspension covered all aspects of the case except for the submission of pauper documentation. The RTC dismissed the complaints due to Petitioners' refusal to make discovery under Rule 29, Section 5 of the 1964 Rules of Court. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Rule 29, Section 5 (1964 Rules of Court):** Sanctions for failure to answer interrogatories, including dismissal of action. The core issue is whether the RTC appropriately exercised its discretion in dismissing the case for failure to answer interrogatories related *solely* to pauper status and not the merits of the underlying claim.
*   **Propriety of Dismissal:** The Supreme Court (SC) held the RTC's dismissal was "precipitate". The SC distinguished this case from *Arellano v. Court of First Instance of Sorsogon*, where a deliberate disregard for court orders regarding the main issue led to dismissal. Here, the failure was due to a misinterpretation of the suspension order and the interrogatories were related to an *ancillary matter* (pauper status).
*   **Discretion of the Court:** The SC reiterates the principle from *Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. v. Court of Appeals* that the imposition of sanctions for failure to make discovery is discretionary, and should be exercised with consideration for the interests of justice. The modes of discovery are not meant to cause injustice.
*   **Jurisdictional Issue (Docket Fees):** The SC acknowledges that payment of docket fees is jurisdictional (*Sun Insurance Office Ltd. v. Asuncion*). This is the legal justification for exploring the petitioners' financial status.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 24, Section 1 & Rule 25, Section 1 (1964 Rules of Court): Pertaining to the use and purpose of written interrogatories.
*   Rule 29, Section 5 (1964 Rules of Court): Sanctions for refusal to make discovery.
*   Rule 45, Section 4 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (certification against forum shopping).

**Case Law:**

*   *Ramos v. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. of the P.I.* & *Macawiwili Gold Mining and Development Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*: Defines the distinction between questions of law and questions of fact for certiorari review.
*   *Republic v. Sandiganbayan*: Discusses the purpose of discovery.
*   *Arellano v. Court of First Instance of Sorsogon*: Illustrates a case where dismissal for failure to make discovery was upheld due to blatant disregard for court orders.
*   *Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. v. Court of Appeals*:  Emphasizes the court's discretion in imposing discovery sanctions and its duty to avoid injustice.
*   *Sun Insurance Office Ltd. v. Asuncion*: Confirms that payment of docket fees is jurisdictional.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity of Suspension Order:** The primary legal risk was the lack of clarity in the RTC's suspension order, leading to Petitioners' good-faith misinterpretation. A clearer order could have prevented the issue.
*   **Discretion Abuse Argument:** While the SC reversed the dismissal, there's always a risk that the RTC on remand could still impose other sanctions (short of dismissal) if Petitioners fail to cooperate with discovery *after* being explicitly ordered to do so.
*   **Good Faith Requirement:** This case underscores the importance of acting in good faith during discovery. If Petitioners had deliberately avoided answering the interrogatories, the outcome might have been different.

**Conclusion:**

The SC reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, remanding the case to the RTC for trial. The key takeaway is that dismissal for failure to make discovery is a drastic sanction, particularly when the discovery relates to a preliminary issue rather than the merits of the case and when the failure stems from a good-faith misinterpretation of a court order. The court's discretion must be exercised to ensure justice, not to impose technical hurdles that prevent a party from being heard.
