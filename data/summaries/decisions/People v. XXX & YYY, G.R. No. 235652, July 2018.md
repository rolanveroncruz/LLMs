**Legal Document Summary: People v. XXX and YYY (G.R. No. 235652, July 09, 2018)**

**Case:** Appeal of CA Decision affirming RTC Judgment convicting XXX and YYY of multiple counts of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under RA 9208 (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003).

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9208, Section 3(a):** Definition of "Trafficking in Persons."
*   **RA 9208, Section 4(a):** Recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring, providing, or receiving a person for purposes of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, etc.  Applicable to XXX's conviction in Criminal Case No. 24608-B (AAA's case).
*   **RA 9208, Section 4(e):** Maintaining or hiring a person to engage in prostitution or pornography. Basis for multiple counts of conviction.
*   **RA 9208, Section 6:**  "Qualified Trafficking in Persons."  Specifically:
    *   **(a):** Trafficked person is a child.
    *   **(d):** Offender is an ascendant, parent, sibling, guardian, or person exercising authority over the trafficked person. Qualifying circumstances present in all charges.
*   **RA 9208, Section 10(c):** Penalty for Qualified Trafficking: Life imprisonment and a fine of P2,000,000.00 to P5,000,000.00.

**Facts:**

*   XXX and YYY, parents of AAA, BBB, and CCC, exploited their minor children through cybersex activities and prostitution.
*   XXX and YYY made the minor children engage in sexual activities online in exchange for money.
*   In one count, XXX transported AAA to a hotel in Makati to have sexual intercourse with a foreigner, John Hubbard, for P100,000.00.
*   Children testified against their parents.
*   Defense denied the accusations, claiming no motive for the children's testimony and denying the confiscation of computer gadgets.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** XXX and YYY are criminally liable for Qualified Trafficking in Persons.
*   **Financial Liability:** Liable for fines of P2,000,000.00 per count.  Liable for moral damages of P500,000.00 and exemplary damages of P100,000.00 per victim, per count.
*   **Interest:**  All monetary awards subject to 6% legal interest per annum from finality of judgment until fully paid, per *People v. Jugueta*.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Determination:** The court relies heavily on the credibility of the child witnesses. Challenges to the veracity of their testimony or the strength of corroborating evidence could theoretically form the basis for further appeals, although the Supreme Court generally defers to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
*   **Conspiracy:**  The court found the existence of conspiracy between XXX and YYY. Establishing conspiracy requires proof of a common criminal design.
*   **"Exploitation" under RA 9208:** The broad definition of exploitation includes "prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation." The specific acts committed by the children likely fall within this definition, but arguments could potentially be made about whether their actions constitute prostitution under the law, if that specific element of the definition is closely scrutinized.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The decision cites *People v. Hirang* for damage awards in similar trafficking cases.
*   *People v. Jugueta* is cited regarding the imposition of legal interest.
*   *Peralta v. People* cited for deference to the trial court's credibility assessment.
*   *People v. Matibag, People v. Cadano, Jr. and People v. Lomaque* are cited for general propositions of law.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *affirmed with modifications* the CA decision. Modifications included the award of Moral Damages, Exemplary Damages, and imposing legal interest.

**Note:**  The summary withholds the names of the victims as required by RA 7610, RA 9262, and A.M. No. 04-10-11-SC.
