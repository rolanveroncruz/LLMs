## Legal Document Summary: Crystal v. BPI (G.R. No. 172428)

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing the Court of Appeals' affirmation of the RTC's decision in favor of Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan Agreements:** Spouses Crystal and Cebu Contractors Consortium Co. (CCCC) obtained loans from BPI (Butuan and Cebu City branches), secured by chattel and real estate mortgages and a continuing suretyship. Relevant promissory notes stipulate joint and several liability for the spouses and CCCC.
*   **Real Estate Mortgages:** Spouses executed two real estate mortgages over their property in favor of BPI-Cebu City to secure CCCC's loans.
*   **Continuing Suretyship:** Spouses bound themselves as surety for CCCC's loan from BPI-Butuan.
*   **Foreclosure:** BPI foreclosed both chattel and real estate mortgages due to CCCC's default. The proceeds from chattel mortgage didn't cover the full loan amount.
*   **Third-Party Offer (IBAA):** Insular Bank of Asia and America (IBAA) offered to purchase the mortgaged property and directly pay BPI, but BPI rejected this.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Spouses Crystal:** Solidarily liable with CCCC for the loan obligations due to the "jointly and severally" clause in the promissory notes. They are also liable as sureties for CCCC's loans.
*   **CCCC:** Primarily liable for the loans.
*   **BPI:** Obligated to apply proceeds from foreclosures to the outstanding loan amounts.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Refusal of Payment:** Petitioners argue that BPI's refusal of IBAA's payment offer extinguished the debt. The Supreme Court held that BPI was not obligated to accept payment from a third party without a stipulation to that effect (Art. 1236, Civil Code), highlighting the principle of relativity of contracts (Art. 1311, Civil Code). This could be a point of contention if there were circumstances implying a waiver by BPI or an understanding that IBAA's offer would be accepted.
*   **Suretyship vs. Guaranty:** Petitioners argued that they were mere guarantors and BPI should have exhausted CCCC's assets first. The Supreme Court characterized the spouses' undertaking as a *suretyship* due to the solidary liability, negating the benefit of excussion.
*   **Moral Damages:** The award of moral damages to BPI was deleted. The court clarified that while corporations can potentially recover moral damages, it requires proof of reputational damage directly linked to the defendant's actions, not merely the inconvenience of litigation (citing *ABS-CBN v. CA* and *Filipinas Broadcasting v. Ago Medical*).

**Outcome:** Petition denied. Court of Appeals' decision affirmed with modification, deleting the award of moral damages to BPI. Exemplary damages and attorney's fees upheld due to the unfounded nature of the spouses' complaint.
