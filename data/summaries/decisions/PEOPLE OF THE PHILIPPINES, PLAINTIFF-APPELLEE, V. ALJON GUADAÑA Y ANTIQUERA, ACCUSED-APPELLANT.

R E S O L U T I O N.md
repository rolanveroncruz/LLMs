## Legal Document Summary: People v. Guada単a (G.R. No. 234160)

**Nature:** Resolution affirming the CA decision, which in turn affirmed the RTC judgment convicting Aljon Guada単a of violating Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) for illegal sale of 0.058 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride ("shabu").

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, R.A. No. 9165:** Criminalizes the unauthorized sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution, or transportation of dangerous drugs.
*   **Chain of Custody (Section 21, R.A. No. 9165 and its IRR):** Requires immediate physical inventory and photography of seized drugs after seizure/confiscation, in the presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official. All required to sign the inventory.

**Liabilities:**

*   Guada単a: Sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of Php 1,000,000.00 for illegal sale of dangerous drugs. Sentence explicitly stated to be without eligibility for parole.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Minor Deviations from the Chain of Custody Rule:** The defense could argue that the non-strict compliance with Section 21 renders the seized drugs inadmissible as evidence. Specifically, the inventory and photography were not conducted immediately at the scene but at the barangay hall due to darkness and safety concerns. Also, the absence of DOJ and media representatives during inventory poses a potential challenge. The prosecution argued, and the courts accepted, that such deviations were justified due to practical considerations (remote location, time of day, security concerns, unavailability of representatives in the municipality) and the integrity of the evidence was preserved.
*   **"Saving Clause" of IRR Section 21(a):** Relied upon by the prosecution. The clause states that non-compliance with the chain of custody requirements does not automatically invalidate the seizure if justified and the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved. The courts found the justifications for non-compliance reasonable.
*   **Insufficient Evidence for Co-Accused Lulu:** Lulu was acquitted due to insufficient evidence. This could potentially be used to argue reasonable doubt concerning the entire operation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** The core statute under which Guada単a was charged and convicted.
*   **Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165:** Outlines the penalties for selling dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, R.A. No. 9165 and its IRR:** Details the chain of custody requirements for seized drugs.
*   **Kevin Belmonte y Goromeo v. People (G.R. No. 224143, June 28, 2017):**  Outlines the elements to be proven for illegal sale of dangerous drugs (identity of buyer/seller, object, consideration, delivery, and payment; and that the identity of the drug is established beyond reasonable doubt.)
*   **People v. Vicente Sipin y De Castro (G.R. No. 224290, June 11, 2018):** Explains "justifiable grounds" for non-compliance with Section 21.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation and application of the "saving clause" in the IRR of R.A. No. 9165 is inherently subjective. Whether the justification for deviations from the chain of custody is sufficient is a question of fact and law that could be contested.
*   The case doesn't explicitly outline any specific procedure on how the police contacted the media representative and DOJ representative which can be used as leverage for appeal.
