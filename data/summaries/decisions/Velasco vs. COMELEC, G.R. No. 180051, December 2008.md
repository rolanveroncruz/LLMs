Here's a legal summary of *Velasco v. COMELEC*, 595 Phil. 1172 (2008), as requested:

**Case:** *Nardo M. Velasco v. Commission on Elections and Mozart P. Panlaqui* G.R. No. 180051, December 24, 2008

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65, seeking to annul COMELEC Resolutions canceling Velasco's Certificate of Candidacy (COC) for Mayor of Sasmuan, Pampanga.

**Facts:**

*   Velasco, a naturalized U.S. citizen, reacquired Philippine citizenship under RA 9225 (Citizenship Retention and Re-Acquisition Act of 2003).
*   Velasco applied for voter registration, but the ERB denied his application.
*   The MTC reversed the ERB's decision and ordered Velasco's inclusion in the List of Voters of Sasmuan.
*   The RTC reversed the MTC decision, ruling that Velasco had lost his domicile when he became a US citizen and did not meet the residency requirement to register as a voter; the RTC based its conclusion on *Caasi v. Court of Appeals*.
*   Velasco filed a COC for Mayor, stating he was a registered voter.
*   Panlaqui filed a Petition to Deny Due Course to/Cancel Velasco's COC, alleging he was not a registered voter and lacked the residency requirement.
*   Velasco won the election and was proclaimed Mayor.
*   The COMELEC Second Division canceled Velasco's COC, citing his material misrepresentation in claiming to be a registered voter, as the RTC decision denying his voter inclusion was final and executory under Section 138 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC). The COMELEC en banc affirmed.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether Velasco engaged in forum shopping.
2.  Whether the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in canceling Velasco's COC.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed the petition, finding no grave abuse of discretion by the COMELEC.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 74 & 78, OEC:**  Requires truthful statements of material facts in COCs. False representation of a material fact is grounds for cancellation or denial of due course. The SC emphasized that the "false representation" pertains to facts that refer to a candidate's qualification for elective office such as citizenship and residence.
*   **Section 138, OEC:** Decisions of the RTC in voter inclusion/exclusion cases are final and executory.
*   **RA 9225:** Addresses citizenship retention and re-acquisition.
*   **RA 8189 (Voter's Registration Act):** Section 9 outlines residency requirements to be eligible to vote.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **COC Cancellation:** Velasco's COC was canceled due to material misrepresentation (claiming to be a registered voter when a final RTC decision stated otherwise).
*   **Annulment of Proclamation:** The cancellation of the COC necessarily voided Velasco's proclamation as Mayor.
*   **Criminal Liability:** The court noted that Velasco "may also have to account in a criminal court for making a false statement under oath".
*   **Risk of Invalidating Election Results:**  While generally, election laws are construed liberally to effectuate the will of the people, the Court clarified that material misrepresentations in a COC cannot be excused by an election victory. This serves as a significant limitation on the "will of the people" doctrine, prioritizing adherence to legal requirements.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Caasi v. Court of Appeals:** Used by the RTC to support its conclusion that Velasco had abandoned his domicile when he became a US citizen.
*   **Macalintal v. COMELEC:** Cited by the CA in its initial decision.
*   **Section 78, Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 (OEC):** The basis for Panlaqui's petition to deny due course and/or cancel a COC.
*   **Section 39, Local Government Code (LGC):** The SC cited Section 39 to show that the qualifications of a candidate is essential to being elected.
*   **Nicolas-Lewis v. COMELEC:** Cited by the court to show that dual citizens can vote as absentee voters.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "residence" and "domicile" under Philippine law, particularly for those who have become naturalized citizens of another country and subsequently reacquired Philippine citizenship. The case clarifies the timeline for residency calculation and the impact of U.S. citizenship abandonment.
*   The balance between upholding election results reflecting the "will of the people" and strictly enforcing qualifications for holding public office. The SC specifically limits the application of the "will of the people" doctrine when there is a material misrepresentation in the COC.

**Potential Issues & Considerations:**

*   **Due Process:** Velasco claimed a denial of due process. The SC rejected this, finding that he had the opportunity to be heard in the COC cancellation proceedings.
*   **Velasco's Right to Vote:** The SC emphasized it was not ruling on Velasco's right to vote itself, but on the *materiality* of his misrepresentation about being a registered voter.
*   **Impact of Appeal:**  The SC noted that Velasco improperly appealed the RTC decision, and the CA eventually recognized it lacked jurisdiction over the inclusion/exclusion case.
* **Finality of Decisions**: Court decisions are final and executory as mandated by the OEC.

This summary should provide a concise but legally precise overview of the *Velasco v. COMELEC* case for a legal professional.
