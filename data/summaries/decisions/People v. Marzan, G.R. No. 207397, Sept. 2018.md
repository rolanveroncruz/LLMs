Okay, here's a concise summary of the legal document, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Carpio Marzan y Lutan*, G.R. No. 207397, September 24, 2018. (840 Phil. 395)

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming RTC conviction for Murder (Art. 248, RPC) and Frustrated Homicide (Art. 249, RPC).

**Facts:**

*   Accused-Appellant (Marzan) admits stabbing his brothers, Apolonio (deceased) and Bernardo.
*   Defense: Insanity at the time of the commission. Prosecution presented eyewitness testimony (Bernardo, Erlinda, Lolita) and autopsy report (Dr. Lumibao).
*   Accused-Appellant's wife testified to his erratic behavior.

**RTC Ruling (affirmed by CA):**

*   Guilty of Murder (Apolonio) - *Reclusion Perpetua*.  No mitigating or aggravating circumstances appreciated.
*   Guilty of Frustrated Homicide (Bernardo) - Indeterminate sentence of *Prision Correcional* to *Prision Mayor.*
*   Monetary awards for damages to victims' heirs.

**CA Ruling:**

*   Affirmed RTC's factual findings and legal conclusions.
*   Modified penalty for Frustrated Homicide to reflect voluntary surrender, but Supreme Court reversed that finding.

**Issues on Appeal:**

1.  **Insanity:**  Accused-Appellant argued he was insane (schizophrenia).  Courts rejected this, finding no *complete deprivation of intelligence* at the time of the crime. Cited presumption of sanity and the need for complete lack of discernment for the insanity defense to succeed (Art. 12, RPC). The Supreme Court held that schizophrenia does not fall within the stringent standard contemplated by law as an exempting circumstance.
2.  **Treachery:** Accused-Appellant contested the finding of treachery. Both lower courts found it present given the defenseless state of Apolonio.  The Supreme Court affirmed applying the two-prong test for treachery (employment of means ensuring safety and deliberate choice of method) in conformity with prevailing jurisprudence such as *People vs. Guzman* 542 Phil. 152, 170 (2007).
3.  **Voluntary Surrender:** Accused-Appellant claimed mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.  Supreme Court disagreed, noting the lack of unconditional surrender motivated by guilt or desire to save trouble/expense.  Cited *People v. Lota*, G.R. No. 219580, January 24, 2018, stating this mitigating circumstance is irrelevant because the only penalty applicable is reclusion perpetua due to RA 9346.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

*   Affirmed CA Decision finding Marzan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder and Frustrated Homicide.
*   Reversed CA ruling regarding voluntary surrender.
*   Modified monetary awards: Increased exemplary damages for murder to P75,000.00 (pursuant to *People v. Jugueta*, 783 Phil. 806 (2016)), sentenced accused-appellant to suffer the indeterminate penalty of two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of prision correccional, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as maximum and to pay civil indemnity and moral damages each in the amount of P30,000.00. Award of temperate damages is deleted
*   Interest of 6% per annum on all monetary awards from finality of decision until full payment.

**Key Provisions & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:**  Murder (Art. 248, RPC) and Frustrated Homicide (Art. 249, RPC).
*   **Penalty:**  *Reclusion Perpetua* for Murder; Indeterminate sentence of *Prision Correcional* to *Prision Mayor* for Frustrated Homicide.
*   **Civil Liability:** Significant monetary damages awarded to the heirs of the deceased and the injured victim (civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages, plus interest).

**Potential Risks & Issues:**

*   The defense of insanity failed due to the high burden of proof required to establish a complete deprivation of reason. This highlights the difficulty in successfully asserting an insanity defense.
*   Treachery was successfully established, resulting in a higher penalty for murder. Counsel should be aware of the specific elements and how the prosecution can prove them.
*   Monetary liabilities are substantial and should be a primary consideration in advising the client regarding potential appeals or settlement options.
*   *People v. Jugueta* is important for determining the specific amounts of damages in similar cases.
