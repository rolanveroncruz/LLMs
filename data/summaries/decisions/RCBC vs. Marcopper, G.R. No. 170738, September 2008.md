## Legal Document Summary: RCBC vs. Marcopper Mining Corporation (G.R. No. 170738)

**Type:** Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45)

**Issue:** Whether RCBC was legally obligated to execute a Deed of Partial Release from Mortgage and Pledge in exchange for Marcopper's assignment of a Forbes Park property.

**Holding:** SC granted the petition, reversing the CA decision and ordering Marcopper to pay RCBC the principal, interest, and penalties as stipulated in the promissory notes.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Loan Agreement:** Marcopper obtained a US$13.7M loan from RCBC, secured by chattel mortgage over equipment (trucks, excavator) and pledge of shares (Baguio Country Club, etc.).
*   **Restructuring Proposal:** Marcopper proposed a restructuring, including the assignment of the Forbes Park property as partial payment (dacion en pago).
*   **Deed of Assignment:** RCBC accepted the assignment of the Forbes Park property.
*   **Promissory Notes:** Marcopper executed promissory notes for the restructured balance of the loan.
*   **Alleged Condition:** Marcopper claimed the assignment was conditional upon RCBC releasing the mortgage and pledge. RCBC denied this.
*   **RCBC's Approval:** RCBC later approved the partial release of the mortgage and pledge subject to Marcopper's payment of the first amortization, which Marcopper failed to do.
*   **Surety Agreement:** Marcopper provided a surety (Teodoro G. Bernardino) for the restructured obligation.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Marcopper:** Now liable for the full amount of the outstanding balance under the promissory notes, including principal, interest, penalties, and attorney's fees.
*   **RCBC:** Originally ordered by lower courts to execute Deed of Partial Release and restrained from collecting on the promissory notes. This was reversed by the SC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **RCBC:** Potential risk of unenforceability of security if the original chattel mortgage or pledge documents contain defects or are not properly perfected. RCBC's reliance on Marcopper paying the original promissory notes.
*   **Marcopper:** Defaulting on restructured loan obligations and exposure to full liability, including foreclosure on remaining collateral.
*   **Teodoro Bernardino:** Liability as surety for Marcopper's obligations under the promissory notes.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governing petitions for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Civil Code Articles 1159, 1315:** Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law; contracts perfected by consent.
*   **Jison v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 124853):** Outlining the quantum of evidence in civil cases (preponderance of evidence).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The alleged "agreement" for RCBC to release the mortgage and pledge. The SC found no written evidence of this agreement being a condition precedent to the assignment of the Forbes Park property. Marcopper's claim of oral agreement as confirmed by the court of appeals, was inadmissible to supersede any provision in the promissory note.
*   The exact terms and conditions of the loan restructuring, specifically regarding whether the assignment of the Forbes Park property was intended as a *dacion en pago* with a condition precedent to the release of collateral.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Supreme Court focused on the lack of written evidence supporting Marcopper's claim that the release of the mortgage and pledge was a condition precedent to the assignment of the Forbes Park property. The Court highlighted inconsistencies in Marcopper's actions (e.g., executing an additional pledge after the alleged agreement) and emphasized that contracts are perfected by consent. The Court also applied the principle that a party alleging a right must prove it by a preponderance of the evidence. The Court concluded that RCBC validly approved Marcopper's request to release only upon payment of the first amortization.
