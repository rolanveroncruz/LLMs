Here's a legal summary of the provided *People v. Arellano* case, focusing on key aspects and potential legal issues:

**Case Summary: *People of the Philippines vs. Lustrisimo Arellano*, G.R. No. 176640, August 22, 2008**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Lustrisimo Arellano for three counts of aggravated statutory rape and one count of aggravated rape of his daughter, AAA.

**Key Provisions & Judgement:**

*   **Conviction Affirmed (with modifications):** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision finding Arellano guilty of the charges under Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (R.P.C.).

    *   **Rationale:** The SC gave weight to the positive and credible testimony of the victim, AAA, finding no reason to doubt her credibility, and considering the medical findings of Dr. Mercado supporting penile penetration.
    *The elements of statutory rape were proven as AAA was under 12 during the first 3 offenses, and simple rape as the final offense took place when she was 13.
    *   In a rape committed by a father against his daughter, the father's moral ascendancy and influence over his daughter substitutes for violence or intimidation.

*   **Sentencing:**The supreme court affirmed the CA's decision to impose reclusion perpetua instead of the death penalty, pursuant to Republic Act No. 9346.

    *   **Damages:** The SC modified the damages awarded by the CA.
        *   In Criminal Cases Nos. 11725, 11726, and 11727 (Rape): Increased moral damages to P75,000, maintaining P75,000 civil indemnity and P25,000 exemplary damages.
        *   In Criminal Case No. 11724 (Statutory Rape): Reduced civil indemnity and moral damages to P50,000 each, as the crime was committed before R.A. No. 7659's effective date (death penalty for heinous crimes, thus impacting damage awards).

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Arellano is criminally liable for aggravated statutory rape and aggravated rape.
*   **Civil Liability:** Obligation to pay civil indemnity and moral and exemplary damages to the victim, AAA.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues & Case Law:**

*   **Delay in Reporting:** Appellant argued that the delay in reporting the rape incidents affected AAA's credibility.

    *   **SC's Response:**  The SC applied the established principle that delay is only problematic if unreasonable and unexplained.  It found AAA's explanation – fear of her father and his threats to kill her mother – and her age (7 at the time of the first offense) justified the delay.  The SC cited *People v. Audine* (G.R. No. 168649, December 6, 2006) to support its position that the delay in reporting was adequately justified.
*   **Evidence:** The SC affirmed the CA and RTC in determining the credibility of the witness and evidence presented.
*   **Aggravating Circumstance:**  The SC upheld the lower courts' finding that the crime was aggravated by the familial relationship between the accused and the victim.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (R.P.C.):** Articles 266-A and 266-B (Rape and Statutory Rape)
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:**  Abolished the death penalty.
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:**  Imposed the death penalty on certain heinous crimes; its effectivity date is critical for determining applicable damage awards in Criminal Case No. 11724.
