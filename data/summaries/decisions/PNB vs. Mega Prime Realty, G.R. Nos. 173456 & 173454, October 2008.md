## Legal Document Summary: PNB vs. Mega Prime Realty

**Case:** *Philippine National Bank vs. Mega Prime Realty and Chico-Nazario*, G.R. Nos. 173454 & 173456, October 6, 2008 (588 Phil. 917).

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari regarding the validity of a Deed of Sale of shares of stock in PNB Management and Development Corporation (PNB-Madecor) from Philippine National Bank (PNB) to Mega Prime Realty Corporation (Mega Prime).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Deed of Sale (September 27, 1996):** PNB sold all its PNB-Madecor stockholdings to Mega Prime for P505,620,000.00 "as is where is".  Specifically includes certain real properties of PNB-Madecor located in Quezon City with an area of 19,080sqm as part of this sale.
*   **Loan Agreement & Promissory Note:** Mega Prime entered into a P404,496,000.00 loan agreement with PNB, secured by a pledge of the acquired PNB-Madecor shares.

**Obligations:**

*   **PNB:** To deliver stockholdings in PNB-Madecor, along with the indicated properties, to Mega Prime under the 'clean balance sheet' condition outlined in the deed.
*   **Mega Prime:** To pay the agreed purchase price according to the terms of the Deed of Sale and Loan Agreement.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Breach of Warranty (PNB):** The court found a breach of warranty under Articles 1547 and 1561 of the Civil Code due to the failure to effectively transfer ownership of the land covered by TCT No. 160470 (733.70 sqm), where the title belonged to Marcris Realty and the Quezon City Government. The 'as is where is' clause does not absolve the warranty regarding the seller's right to sell the thing at the time when the ownership is to pass
*   **Diminution of Purchase price (Mega Prime):**  The remedy for the breach of warranty is a proportionate reduction in the purchase price of the property by P19,443,050.00.
*   **Default on Loan (Mega Prime):** Potential risk if Mega Prime continues to fail to meet obligations under the loan agreement, though this is somewhat mitigated by the reduction in price.
*   **Corporate Veil Piercing (Mega Prime):** Mega Prime failed to prove that PNB-Madecor is merely an instrumentality of PNB. Remedy for issues over the TCT will fall under the liability of PNB-Madecor.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 1547 & 1561:**  Implied warranties in sales, particularly against hidden defects and the right to sell.
*   **Article 22 of the Civil Code**: "No person shall be enriched at the expense of another."
*   **Caveat Emptor:** Discussed but ultimately not determinative due to the express warranties in the Deed of Sale.
*   **Doctrine of Corporate Veil Piercing:** Discussed, the court found insufficient evidence to pierce the corporate veil between PNB and PNB-Madecor.
*   **Presumption of Regularity of Public Documents**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"As Is Where Is" Clause:**  The extent to which this clause absolves PNB of responsibility regarding the title defects of the included properties. The court found it does not negate the express warranties made.
*   **"Clean Balance Sheet" Clause:** The precise meaning and implications of this clause in relation to the transfer of the property titles and liabilities.

**Summary of Outcome:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision to reverse the RTC decision and dismiss Mega Prime's complaint for annulment of the Deed of Sale but modified the decision by ordering PNB to proportionately reduce the purchase price of the property for P19,443,050.00 to account for the hidden defect in the land. The Court upheld the dismissal of both PNB and Mega Prime's claims for damages. The court reasoned that Mega Prime failed to prove fraudulent misrepresentation by PNB sufficient for annulment, but PNB’s failure to deliver a clean title warranted a reduction in the purchase price due to the implied warranty against hidden defects. PNB’s counterclaim was correctly dismissed because Mega Prime's complaint was not a ploy to prevent the foreclosure of the pledge.
