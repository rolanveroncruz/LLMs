**Case Summary: JP Latex Technology, Inc. vs. Ballons Granger Balloons, Inc. (G.R. No. 177121)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA decision upholding the RTC's order for execution pending appeal.

**Key Issue:** Propriety of RTC's order of execution pending appeal while a Motion for Reconsideration of the main decision was still pending.

**Facts:**

*   Ballons Granger (Canadian corp.) sued JP Latex (Philippine corp.) for rescission and damages relating to a contract for the sale of machinery. Granger alleged non-payment.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Granger, rescinding the contract, ordering the return of machinery, enjoining the use of Granger's technology, and awarding damages.
*   JP Latex filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the RTC decision.
*   Granger filed a Motion for Execution Pending Appeal. The RTC initially denied the motion.
*   RTC subsequently *granted* Granger's Motion for Reconsideration of the *denial* of the Execution Pending Appeal motion, citing deterioration of equipment and JP Latex's potential inability to pay damages. A writ of execution was issued and implemented.
*   JP Latex filed a Certiorari petition with the CA, which was denied for failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration of the RTC's Order granting Execution Pending Appeal.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and the RTC's Order for Execution Pending Appeal.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Impropriety of Execution Pending Appeal:**  The SC held that Execution Pending Appeal was improper and premature because JP Latex's Motion for Reconsideration of the RTC's main decision was still pending. This prevented the appeal period from commencing. An order for Execution Pending Appeal under Rule 39 Sec 2a requires the trial court to still have jurisdiction (ie the period to appeal is running).
*   **Motion for Reconsideration not a pre-requisite to Certiorari:**  The Court found that a second Motion for Reconsideration (regarding the grant of Execution Pending Appeal) was not a mandatory prerequisite for filing a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 because the RTC had already ruled on the issue on two prior occasions. There was no question that the question raised by the lower courts were already squarely and exhaustively discussed.
*   **Lack of "Good Reason" for Execution Pending Appeal:** The SC held that the RTC failed to present sufficient "good reasons" to justify Execution Pending Appeal. The supposed deterioration of machinery was not supported by evidence, and the mere possibility that JP Latex might be unable to pay damages was insufficient.
*   **Legal Basis:** The Court cited Rule 39, Section 2(a) of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, regarding Discretionary Execution. It also cited the case of *Heirs of the Late Justice Jose BL Reyes v. Court of Appeals* regarding the requirement for good reasons to justify execution pending appeal.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   RTC's initial obligation to resolve JP Latex's Motion for Reconsideration before considering Execution Pending Appeal.
*   Granger's liability for wrongfully obtained Execution Pending Appeal.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity:** The RTC's mislabeling of its Order as "Execution Pending Appeal" despite the unresolved Motion for Reconsideration caused confusion.
*   **Risk:** The wrongful implementation of the writ of execution and dismantling of machinery could create further grounds for JP Latex to claim damages.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 2(a), 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Discretionary Execution (Execution Pending Appeal).
*   **Government of the United States of America v. Hon. Purganan, 438 Phil. 417, 437 (2002):** Exceptions to Motion for Reconsideration before certiorari.
*   **Heirs of the Late Justice Jose BL Reyes v. Court of Appeals:** Requires good reasons for execution pending appeal.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court's decision clarifies the limitations on Execution Pending Appeal, particularly when a Motion for Reconsideration is pending, and emphasizes the importance of presenting "good reasons" to justify such execution. The case also serves as a reminder that procedural shortcuts can lead to reversal on appeal.
