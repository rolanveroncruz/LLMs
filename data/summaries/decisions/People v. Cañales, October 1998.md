## Legal Document Summary: People v. Cañales (G.R. No. 126319)

**Nature:** Supreme Court decision affirming the conviction of Fernando Cañales for Qualified Theft. The Court of Appeals elevated the case due to the penalty imposed.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Qualified Theft (Art. 310, in relation to Arts. 308 & 309 of the Revised Penal Code). Cañales, an employee of First Base Industries Corp., conspired with others to steal a truck and frozen prawns, valued at P1.8 million.
*   **Factual Basis:** Prosecution witness Danilo Ramos, a truck helper, testified to the events leading to the theft, including Cañales' participation.  Key evidence was the Forwarder's Cargo Receipt (Exhibit "C").
*   **Defense:** Alibi and denial. Cañales claimed he was a family driver and was home at the time of the incident. He alleged a coerced confession.
*   **Trial Court Decision:** Guilty. Indeterminate penalty of 13 years, 1 month, 11 days to 18 years, 9 months, 24 days of reclusion temporal, and P2.3 million indemnity.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Affirmed conviction but modified penalty to "reclusion perpetua for forty years with the accessory penalties of death under Article 40 of the Revised Penal Code" based on the interpretation of Article 74 of the RPC regarding penalties higher than Reclusion Perpetua.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Affirmed. Cañales is liable for Qualified Theft. The recovery of the truck does not negate the completed crime, as supported by *People v. Carpio, 54 Phil. 48*.
*   **Indemnity:** Remains liable to First Base Industries Corp. for the value of the stolen goods.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Penalty:** The Court's interpretation of Article 74 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) regarding penalties higher than reclusion perpetua is crucial. The Court adopts Justice Albert's view, imposing Reclusion Perpetua for Forty Years with accessory penalties under Art. 40 of the RPC meaning Cañales cannot be pardoned before 40 years.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution's case hinged on Ramos' testimony. The defense argued inconsistencies in Ramos' testimony, but the Court deemed these minor and did not affect his credibility. The allegedly coerced confession (Exhibit "J") was not the basis for the conviction.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Art. 310 (Qualified Theft), Art. 308 & 309 (Theft), Art. 74 (Penalty higher than Reclusion Perpetua), Art. 25, Art. 40 & 41 (Accessory penalties), Art 27
*   **Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Section 13, Rule 124
*   **People v. Carpio, 54 Phil. 48:** Affirmed that recovery of stolen property does not negate the crime of theft or diminish criminal responsibility.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

This Supreme Court case affirms the conviction of Fernando Cañales for qualified theft. The key issue is the imposition of "reclusion perpetua for forty years" penalty, with the Court adopting Justice Albert's interpretation of Article 74 of the RPC. While the defense challenged the credibility of the prosecution witness and alleged a coerced confession, the Court upheld the lower courts' findings based on the evidence presented, particularly the Forwarder's Cargo Receipt. The risk lies in the interpretation of Article 74 and the length of the sentence given the ongoing debates among legal commentators. The *Carpio* case supports the finding that the crime was consummated despite the truck's recovery.
