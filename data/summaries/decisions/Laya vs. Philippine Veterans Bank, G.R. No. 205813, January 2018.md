**Case Summary: Laya v. Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB), G.R. No. 205813, January 10, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Complaint for illegal dismissal filed by Alfredo Laya, Jr. against Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB).  The central issue is the validity of Laya's compulsory retirement at age 60 under PVB's retirement plan, versus the statutory retirement age of 65 under the Labor Code.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Employment Contract:** Laya was hired as Chief Legal Counsel, VP, with benefits including "Membership in the Provident Fund Program/Retirement Program."  There was no explicit agreement on a specific retirement age in the employment contract.
*   **PVB Retirement Plan:** Established in 1996, it mandates retirement at age 60 (normal retirement), with potential for extension up to age 65 with Board approval (late retirement).  Membership is automatic for regular employees under 55.
*   **Retirement:** Laya was informed of his retirement effective July 1, 2007, at age 60. His request for a two-year extension was denied.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** The Labor Arbiter dismissed the illegal dismissal complaint but awarded indemnity. The NLRC affirmed the dismissal and deleted the indemnity. The Court of Appeals (CA) upheld the NLRC, finding Laya had implicitly agreed to the retirement plan by accepting his employment.
*   **Procedural Issue:** Second Motion for Reconsideration: Initially denied by First Division, the case was referred to Court En Banc. PVB challenged the propriety of the referral after the first motion for reconsideration was denied.
*   **PVB's Status:** PVB is considered a *private commercial bank* and is governed by the Corporation Code and General Banking Act. Previous jurisprudence (Philippine Veterans Bank Employees Union-NUBE v. Philippine Veterans Bank) established that the bank is not government-owned or controlled.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court (En Banc) **granted** the petition, reversed the CA decision, and declared PVB guilty of illegally dismissing Laya.

**Key Legal Reasoning and Obligations:**

*   **Employee Consent to Retirement Plan:**  The Court held that for a private employer to enforce a retirement age lower than 65, the *employee's consent must be express, voluntary, free, and uncompelled.* The mere mention of the retirement plan in the appointment letter and automatic membership in the retirement plan was deemed insufficient to establish explicit consent. *Cercado v. Uniprom, Inc.* (G.R. No. 188154, October 13, 2010) was cited to emphasize that acceptance of an early retirement age must be "explicit, voluntary, free, and uncompelled."
*   **Contract of Adhesion:** PVB's retirement plan, established solely by PVB and with automatic membership, was deemed a contract of adhesion. The court stated that the employee was reduced to mere submission by accepting employment, and automatic membership did not equate to free and voluntary consent.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Because Laya did not knowingly and voluntarily agree to the retirement provision, his dismissal at age 60 constituted illegal dismissal.
*   **Relief:** Laya is entitled to:
    *   Backwages from the date of illegal dismissal until his 65th birthday (compulsory retirement age), with legal interest calculated as outlined in *Nacar v. Gallery Frames*.
    *   Separation pay computed according to PVB's retirement plan (Section 4, Article V).

**Liabilities:**

*   PVB is liable for backwages, separation pay, and costs of the suit.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Second Motion for Reconsideration:** PVB argued the Court should not have accepted Laya's second motion for reconsideration.  The Court held the acceptance was proper due to exceptional circumstances and the higher interest of justice.
*   **Employee's Sophistication:** Justice Leonen dissented arguing that Laya, as Chief Legal Counsel, should have understood the contract and cannot claim ignorance.
*   **Waiver of Constitutional Right:** Justice Carpio in a concurring opinion stated that any waiver of a constitutional right, in this case, the right to security of tenure, must be clear, categorical, knowing, and intelligent.

**Statutory References:**

*   Labor Code, Article 287 (Retirement), now Article 302 by virtue of R.A. No. 10151
*   Labor Code, Article 279 (Security of Tenure), now Article 294 by virtue of R.A. No. 10151

*   *Banco De Oro Unibank, Inc. v. Guillermo C. Sagaysay*

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "Membership in the Provident Fund Program/Retirement Program" clause in Laya's appointment letter. The ambiguity lies in whether this clause constituted express consent to the specific terms of PVB's retirement plan, especially the compulsory retirement age. The Court found it did *not.*
*   The application of private sector labor laws to PVB, given its unique creation through special charter. The Court clearly stated it is a *private bank.*
