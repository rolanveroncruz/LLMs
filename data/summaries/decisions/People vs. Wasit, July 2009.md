**Legal Document Summary: People v. Wasit, G.R. No. 182454**

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Felix Wasit for rape under Art. 266-A and Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353). Wasit was found guilty of raping a 13-year-old girl in her boarding house. The RTC decision, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered him to pay damages to the victim.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Violation:** Rape under Art. 266-A and Art. 266-B RPC, involving carnal knowledge of a minor female against her will, through taking advantage of superior strength and with lewd designs.
*   **Penalty:** *Reclusion Perpetua* and payment of damages.
*   **Obligation:** Wasit's obligation to serve the sentence and pay the monetary awards.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Conviction for rape.
*   **Civil Liability:**  Payment of civil indemnity (₱50,000), moral damages (₱50,000), and exemplary damages (₱30,000).

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Wasit argued that the prosecution witnesses, including the victim, were not credible.  The SC rejected this, deferring to the lower court's assessment of the victim's demeanor and testimony.  The court emphasized that in rape cases, victim credibility is paramount.
*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The defense pointed to minor inconsistencies in the testimonies. The Court, however, ruled that these were inconsequential and did not pertain to the crucial element of the rape itself. The inconsistencies regarding undressing the girl and her awakening were not viewed as substantial flaws.
*   **Alibi Defense:** The defense presented an alibi, supported by family members. The court deemed this unreliable in light of the victim's positive identification of Wasit.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 266-A and Art. 266-B (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines and penalizes the crime of rape.
*   **People v. Mateo:**  Cited for the transfer of the case to the CA for intermediate review.
*   **People v. Opong, People v. Magbanua, People v. De Guzman y Pascual:** Cited for the importance of victim's credibility in rape cases.
*   **Llave v. People:** Cited for giving credit to the victim when of tender age and immature.
*   **People v. Dela Cruz:** Cited for inconsistencies in the testimony.
*   **People v. Sia:** Cited for the increase of exemplary damages.
*   **RA 7610 and 9262; People v. Cabalquinto:** Cited for the reason the victim's name and personal circumstances were withheld.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Points Addressed:**

*   The defense's argument that it was illogical for Wasit to insert his finger after penile penetration was deemed inconsequential by the Court.
*   The claim that it was impossible for Tipang to hear footsteps from the ground floor was dismissed as illogical. The Court deferred to the lower court's assessment of fact.

**Overall Assessment:** The conviction is highly likely to be upheld due to the courts' reliance on the victim's credible testimony and positive identification of Wasit. The alibi defense was weak.  The key risk for Wasit is the upholding of the *reclusion perpetua* sentence and the payment of substantial damages.
