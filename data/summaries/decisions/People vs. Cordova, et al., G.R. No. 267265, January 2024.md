## Legal Document Summary: People v. Cordova et al. (G.R. No. 267265)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (appeal from CA affirmation of RTC conviction)

**Subject Matter:** Violation of Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession) of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Parties:**

*   **Plaintiff-Appellee:** People of the Philippines
*   **Accused-Appellants:** Edwin Cordova y Manalastas and Jayson Taladua y Barbarra
*   **Accused (Acquitted at RTC):** Jaime Cordova y Manalastas
*   **Accused (Plea Bargained):** Mary Antonette Del Rosario y Tamondong

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Lower Court Ruling:** The RTC convicted Edwin and Taladua of violating Sections 5 and 11 of R.A. 9165. Mary Antonette Del Rosario plea bargained to Section 12 and was convicted of that offense.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA and *acquitted* Edwin and Taladua. It also acquitted Mary Antonette del Rosario.
*   **Basis for Reversal:** The prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody, specifically the *first link* relating to the initial seizure, marking, inventory, and photographing of the seized drugs.
*   **Critical Defect:** The insulating witnesses (Barangay Captain and media representative) were not present "immediately after seizure and confiscation" (as required per *People v. Casa*, *Nisperos v. People*) .  The marking and inventory occurred at least 25 minutes *after* the arrest, which the SC found unreasonable.
*   **Impact of R.A. 10640:** While R.A. 10640 allows inventory at the nearest police station under certain conditions, it does *not* negate the requirement for *immediate* marking and presence of witnesses; integrity and evidentiary value must be preserved.
*   **Justifiable Grounds and Saving Clause Analysis:** The prosecution failed to offer *any* justification for the delay.  The SC held that failure to justify the non-compliance with Section 21 renders any saving clause moot. (*People v. Bermejo*)
*   **Acquittal of Del Rosario:** Despite the finality of Del Rosario's conviction (due to plea bargaining), the SC *acquitted* her as well, applying Section 11(a), Rule 122 of the Rules of Court. A favorable judgment (acquittal) for co-accused (Edwin and Taladua) benefits Del Rosario.
* **Relevant Case Law:**
    * *People v. Casa*: Requires inventory and photographing of drugs immediately after seizure and confiscation
    * *Nisperos v. People*: Consolidated guidelines for marking, inventory and photographs
    * *People v. Somira*: Emphasizes the importance of marking the seized drugs immediately after they are seized from the accused
    * *People v. Zakaria*: Highlights the importance of separating the marked evidence from the corpus of all other similar or related evidence from the time of seizure
*   **Statutory References:**
    * R.A. No. 9165, Sections 5, 11, 12, and 21
    * R.A. No. 10640 (amending Section 21 of R.A. 9165)
    * Rule 122, Section 11(a) of the Rules of Court.
    * A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC (Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases)

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The decision underscores the strict application of the chain of custody rule, potentially creating avenues for acquittal in similar drug cases where the prosecution cannot demonstrate immediate and proper compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165, as amended. The "justifiable grounds" exception is narrowly construed, requiring explicit justification for any deviation.
*   The application of Rule 122, Section 11(a) raises questions about the finality of judgments based on plea bargains in drug cases, as the subsequent acquittal of co-accused could nullify the plea-bargained conviction.
*   Reliance on the "unreasonable" timing for the inventory and the presence of witnesses could be contentious; arguments could arise on what constitutes a reasonable delay given specific factual circumstances.

**Obligations:**

*   Director General of the Bureau of Corrections is required to report to the Court within five days of the ruling on the release of Edwin Cordova y Manalastas and Jayson Taladua y Barbarra.
*   Immediate implementation of the Courtâ€™s decision.
