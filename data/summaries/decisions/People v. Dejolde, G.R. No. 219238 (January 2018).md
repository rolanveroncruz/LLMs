## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Dejolde, Jr.*

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Moises Dejolde, Jr. y Salino* (G.R. No. 219238, January 31, 2018)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and two counts of Estafa.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Illegal Recruitment (Large Scale):** Violation of Art. 13(b) in relation to Arts. 38(b), 34, and 39 of PDs 1920/2018 and RA 8042.  Dejolde recruited complainants for employment as caregivers in the UK without a license from DOLE/POEA and failed to deploy them.
*   **Estafa (2 counts):** Violation of Art. 315 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). Dejolde defrauded Jessie Doculan and Naty Loman by falsely representing his ability to secure UK travel documents in exchange for payment.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Illegal Recruitment:** Life imprisonment and a fine of Php 1,000,000 (increased from Php 100,000 by the CA, referencing *People v. Chua*, 695 Phil. 16 (2012)).
*   **Estafa:** Original indeterminate sentence of 4 years, 2 months, and 1 day of *prision correccional* (min) to 20 years of *reclusion temporal* (max) was **modified** due to RA 10951. New indeterminate sentence: 2 months and 1 day of *arresto mayor* (min) to 1 year and 1 day of *prision correccional* (max) for each count.
*   **Restitution:** Ordered to pay Jessie Doculan Php 440,000 and Naty Loman Php 350,000 in actual damages, plus 6% interest per annum from the date of finality of the Resolution until full payment.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Findings Upheld:** The Courts relied heavily on the factual findings of the RTC regarding witness credibility. A challenge based on the sufficiency of evidence would be difficult given the established deference to trial court observations.
*   **Impact of RA 10951:** The retroactive application of RA 10951 significantly reduced the penalty for Estafa. The calculation and application of the indeterminate sentence under the amended law appear to be correctly applied.
*   **Defense of Denial:** Appellant's defense of denial was deemed weak, failing to overcome the positive testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Presidential Decree Nos. 1920 and 2018:** Regulate Overseas Employment
*   **Republic Act No. 8042 (Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995):** Governs overseas recruitment and deployment.
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Art. 315:** Defines Estafa.
*   **Republic Act No. 10951:** Adjusted penalties in the RPC based on the value of the property involved.
*   **People v. Chua, 695 Phil. 16 (2012):** Cited for the CA's increase in the fine for Illegal Recruitment.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied to determine the sentence for the estafa convictions.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' findings of guilt but adjusted the estafa penalties to conform to RA 10951. The ruling strengthens the government's ability to prosecute illegal recruiters and offers legal recourse to victims of fraudulent employment schemes. However, challenges to the factual findings are unlikely to succeed given the established jurisprudence.
