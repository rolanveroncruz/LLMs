## Legal Document Summary: *Pagsibigan v. People and Cabasal*

**Case:** *Romualdo Pagsibigan v. People of the Philippines and Eleazar Cabasal*, G.R. No. 163868, June 4, 2009 (606 Phil. 233). This is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.

**Facts:** Cabasal (private respondent) purchased property from Pagsibigan (petitioner), acting as an agent for Hinal, the original GSIS buyer. Cabasal paid Pagsibigan P215,000.  Hinal, however, did not authorize the sale or receive the money. Despite Cabasal’s payment and subsequent occupancy/renovations, GSIS demanded payment from Hinal, threatening cancellation of the conditional sale. Hinal eventually executed a Deed of Transfer of Rights to Cabasal out of sympathy, without consideration. Cabasal sued Pagsibigan for estafa and recovery of funds.

**Lower Court Rulings:**

*   **RTC:** Acquitted Pagsibigan of Estafa due to lack of proof of prior fraudulent representation. (Art. 315, paragraph 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code requirements not met). Found Pagsibigan civilly liable for P215,000 plus legal interest from demand, and attorney's fees of P20,000.
*   **CA:** Affirmed the RTC in toto, finding sufficient evidence to support civil liability. Cited *solutio indebiti* as a basis for Pagsibigan’s obligation to return the money (Art. 2154, Civil Code), given Pagsibigan's misrepresentation of authority. The deed transfer from Hinal to Cabasal did not extinguish Pagsibigan's debt.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   Partially granted the petition, affirming the CA decision with modification.
*   Upheld the finding of civil liability for P215,000 plus interest. Determined the factual nature of the question of receipt of funds made CA and RTC findings binding. Established exceptions to such rule as none of the applicable circumstances existed.
*   **Deleted** the award of attorney's fees (P20,000) and expenses of litigation because the lower courts failed to provide factual or legal justification within the body of the decision, as required under existing jurisprudence. *Consolidated Bank & Trust Corporation v. Court of Appeals* 316 Phil. 246, 260 (1995).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Civil Liability:** Pagsibigan is liable to Cabasal for P215,000 plus legal interest from the date of demand. Based on *solutio indebiti* (Art. 2154 of Civil Code)
*   **Estafa:** Pagsibigan was acquitted of criminal liability for estafa, based on lack of prior or simultaneous fraudulent representations.
*   **Deed of Transfer of Rights:**  The transfer deed from Hinal to Cabasal did not extinguish Pagsibigan's obligation to return the money.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Interest Calculation:** The precise date of demand for calculating interest needs clarification if not already established in the lower court records.
*   **Enforcement:** Cabasal will need to pursue enforcement of the judgment to recover the funds.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Justification for attorney's fees:** The SC decision highlights the requirement for specific justifications within the body of the judgment when awarding attorney's fees.
*   **Grounds for civil liability:** CA stated grounds for Pagsibigan's obligation to return the money to Cabasal is sourced from Quasi-contract, particularly *solutio indebiti.* Cabasal approached Pagsibigan to acquire the property, and Pagsibigan was the only actor misrepresenting his authority. This potentially strengthens his culpability over Hinal.
