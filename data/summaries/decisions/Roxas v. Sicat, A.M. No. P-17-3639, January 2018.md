**Case Summary: Roxas v. Sicat, A.M. No. P-17-3639, January 23, 2018 (824 Phil. 239)**

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative complaint against Sheriff III Allen Francisco S. Sicat for gross inefficiency and gross misconduct.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Civil Case (No. 10-826):** ROTA Creditline Finance Corp. vs. Arnold Cruz, et al.  Judgment based on Compromise Agreement with Miradora Mejia (one of the defendants). Only Mejia was bound by the compromise agreement.
*   **Writ of Execution:** Issued against Mejia.  Sicat levied on real property owned by Renato Nunag (who was NOT a party to the Compromise Agreement). This is a critical error.
*   **Procedural Irregularities:**
    *   Failure to submit an estimate of expenses to the court for approval, violating Francia v. Esguerra, 746 Phil. 423 (2014), citing A.M. No. 04-2-04-SC.
    *   No liquidation report submitted to the OCC-MTCC.
    *   Failure to provide notices to the judgment obligor (Mejia) regarding the sale, as required by Section 15, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.
    *   No Sheriff’s Return of Writ/Report within 30 days, as required by Section 14, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.
    *   No evidence of publication and raffle for newspaper selection for publishing Notice of Sheriff’s Sale.
    *   Discrepancies in auction sale dates suggesting a simulated sale.
    *   Unilateral discharge of levy on Nunag's property without court order.
    *   Accepting direct payments from ROTA, which is prohibited, violating Bernabe v. Eguid, as cited in Francia v. Esguerra.
*   **Conflict of Interest (Alleged):**  Initially expressed interest in buying the property being auctioned, but this was dismissed for lack of evidence.
*   **Prior Administrative Record:** Previously found guilty of misconduct in A.M. No. P-00-1423 for implementing a writ not addressed to him and failing to observe Section 10, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Ministerial Duty of Sheriff:** Sheriff's duty to execute the writ is purely ministerial.  Anico v. Pilipiña, 670 Phil. 460 (2011) is cited on the necessity of due care and diligence.
*   **Violation of Rules of Court:** Failure to adhere to Rule 39 (Execution, Satisfaction and Effect of Judgments) and Rule 141 (Legal Fees) of the Rules of Court.
*   **Liabilities:** Found guilty of gross neglect of duty, inefficiency in the performance of official duties and misconduct.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Simulated Sale:** The discrepancies in the auction dates raise serious questions about the integrity of the sale. This could lead to further legal challenges related to the property title.
*   **Wrongful Levy:**  Levying on Nunag's property when he was not a party to the Compromise Agreement exposed the Sheriff to potential damages claims from Nunag.
*   **Discharge of Levy:** Unilateral discharge of levy without court order may have violated Nunag's rights.
*   **Reliance on Ricky Dizon:** The sheriff's reliance on Dizon's information (regarding Nunag's liability and delaying execution) appears to have been a significant factor contributing to the procedural errors.  Improper delegation and abdication of his ministerial duties.
*   **Ambiguity of Dates:** The inconsistent dates related to the Notice of Sheriff's Sale (November 4, 2013, November 29, 2013, December 10, 2013) create an ambiguity and raises doubt about the conduct of the auction.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 39 (Execution, Satisfaction and Effect of Judgments), Rule 141 (Legal Fees)
*   **Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Section 46, Rule 10 (Gross neglect of duty and grave misconduct as grave offenses)
*   **Relevant Case Law:**
    *   *Francia v. Esguerra*, 746 Phil. 423 (2014):  Procedures for payment and disbursement of execution fees.
    *   *Anico v. Pilipiña*, 670 Phil. 460 (2011): Sheriff's ministerial duty and consequences of non-compliance.
    *   *Deang v. Sheriff Sicat*, 487 Phil. 246 (2004): Prior administrative case against the respondent.
    *   *Bernabe v. Eguid*: As cited in Francia v. Esguerra

**Outcome:**

*   Sheriff Allen Francisco S. Sicat was dismissed from service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and privileges and with prejudice to re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government.
