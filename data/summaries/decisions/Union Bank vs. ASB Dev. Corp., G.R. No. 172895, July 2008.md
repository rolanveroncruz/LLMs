## Legal Document Summary: Union Bank v. ASB Development Corporation (G.R. No. 172895)

**Case Overview:**

This case concerns Union Bank's (UBP) attempt to extrajudicially foreclose on properties of ASB Development Corporation (ASBDC) despite an existing SEC suspension order issued during ASBDC's rehabilitation proceedings. The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, affirming the SEC's nullification of UBP's foreclosure.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Mortgage Trust Indenture (MTI):** ASBDC executed an MTI with RCBC as trustee for creditor banks (including UBP) to secure a loan. UBP's share was 10.32%.
*   **SEC Suspension Order (PD 902-A, Sec. 6(c)):** The SEC issued a suspension order against all actions/claims against ASBDC upon the filing of its Petition for Rehabilitation. This order aimed to preserve ASBDC's assets during rehabilitation.
*   **Foreclosure Rights (MTI, Art VII, Sections 7.04 & 7.16):** RCBC, as trustee, held the primary authority to foreclose. Individual holders of participation certificates (like UBP) could only foreclose under specific conditions, including written notice to the trustee and a request from holders of at least 51% of the outstanding face amount of the participation certificates.
*   **Rules of Procedure on Corporate Recovery:** Outlines requirements for suspension of payment (Rule III) and rehabilitation proceedings (Rule IV).

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **UBP's Unauthorized Foreclosure:** UBP initiated extrajudicial foreclosure while the SEC suspension order was in effect, violating PD 902-A.
*   **Non-Compliance with MTI:** UBP failed to meet the conditions in the MTI (Section 7.16) required for an individual holder of participation certificates to initiate foreclosure. Specifically, UBP didn't establish that it obtained the request of holders of at least 51% of the total face amount of the participation certificates before moving to foreclose.
*   **Violation of SEC Order:** The court held the suspension order, once determined valid, prohibited UBP from exercising any right to foreclosure against the ASB group.
*   **Res Judicata & Law of the Case:** While res judicata didn't directly apply to the interlocutory suspension order, the principle of "law of the case" barred UBP from relitigating the validity of the SEC's suspension order as that matter had already been decided by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. 153830.
*   **Dismissal on appeal based on jurisdiction:** UBP argued the SEC lacked jurisdiction. This was rejected. The Court held that ASBDCâ€™s claim of foreseen inability to pay debts within one year brought it within the definition of a "technically insolvent" entity, giving the SEC the jurisdiction to entertain the rehabilitation petition.
*   **Impairment of Contracts (Constitution):** Union bank asserted that the SEC order impaired it's right to contract. The court dismissed the notion that the Suspension order of the SEC hearing panel impaired the contract between the two parties.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **PD 902-A, Sec. 6(c):** Grants SEC the power to issue suspension orders during rehabilitation proceedings.
*   **Act No. 3135:** Law governing extrajudicial foreclosure sales.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 1159, 1308:** Relevant to the issue of mutuality of contracts.
*   **SEC Rules of Procedure on Corporate Recovery (Rules III & IV):** Defines "technical insolvency" and outlines procedures for suspension of payments and rehabilitation proceedings.
*   **G.R. No. 153830:** SC decision establishing the "law of the case" regarding the validity of the SEC suspension order.
*   **G.R. No. 166197 (MBTC v. ASB Holdings):** SC case upholding the validity of the Rehabilitation Plan, which impliedly affirmed the SEC's jurisdiction over the proceedings.
*   **Montilla v. Court of Appeals:** Cited by UBP regarding the finality of interlocutory orders; however, the SC relied on the law of the case principle.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **MTI Sections 7.04 & 7.16:** Interpretation of these provisions regarding the conditions under which an individual holder of participation certificates can initiate foreclosure was central to the dispute. While the SC held that the even of default under 7.01 allowed foreclosure, that power was also suspended.

**Conclusion:**

UBP's attempt to foreclose was deemed invalid due to the existing SEC suspension order and its failure to comply with the conditions stipulated in the MTI for individual holders of participation certificates to initiate foreclosure. This decision reinforces the power of the SEC in rehabilitation proceedings and emphasizes the importance of adhering to contractual provisions regarding foreclosure rights.
