Here's a legal summary of the document:

**Case:** *Cecilia T. Faelnar vs. Felicidad Dadivas Palabrica*, A.M. No. P-06-2251, January 20, 2009.

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Felicidad Dadivas Palabrica, a former Court Stenographer III, for Dishonesty, Falsification of Public Documents, Violation of Republic Act No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees), and Violation of Article XI of the Constitution.

**Key Provisions/Allegations:**

*   Palabrica allegedly misrepresented her civil status as "single" in her Personal Data Sheets (PDS) and Statement of Assets and Liabilities (SAL) for CY 2003 and 2004, despite being married since 1995. False declaration in PhilHealth record and loan applications to GSIS and SC Savings and Loan Association
*   Complainant Faelnar, the former Clerk of Court, argued this constituted defrauding the judiciary.

**Respondent's Defense:**

*   Denial of forum shopping and merit of the complaint.
*   Claimed the PDS error was inadvertent.
*   Argued the omission of spouse's name in the SAL was immaterial, done in good faith due to husband's Australian citizenship and potential difficulty/expense of obtaining his signature.
*   Argued that because her husband did not own any real property, she perceived it better to state "N/A" in the blank provided for the name of spouse.
*   Claims to have submitted a corrected PDS.
*   Argued that the filing of a PDS is foreign to her position as stenographer.

**Procedural History:**

*   Complaint filed with the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA).
*   Parties initially willing to submit based on pleadings.
*   Later, a formal investigation was ordered and referred to the Executive Judge of the RTC, Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon.
*   Palabrica resigned and moved to Australia.
*   Faelnar was dismissed from service in a separate case.
*   Palabrica waived her right to appear at the investigation, arguing the court lost jurisdiction.
*   Investigating Judge found that respondent's claim of inadvertence lacked merit, concluding that respondent intended to make it appear in her official documents that she was single.
*   Investigating Judge still recommended dismissal, deeming it an "error in judgment."
*   OCA recommended a fine of P40,000.00 due to misrepresentation and falsification after the Final Report was referred to them for evaluation.

**Holding/Decision:**

*   The Supreme Court found Palabrica **GUILTY** of dishonesty and falsification of official documents.
*   In lieu of dismissal (due to prior resignation), Palabrica was **FINED** P40,000.00, to be deducted from any remaining benefits.

**Rationale:**

*   The Court rejected Palabrica's defense of inadvertence, citing the repeated nature of the misrepresentations.
*   Accomplishing the PDS and SAL is connected to government employment.
*   Dishonesty, even outside official duties, affects fitness to continue in office. (Cites *Remolona v. CSC*, G.R. No. 137473, August 2, 2001, 362 SCRA 304, 313 and *Nera v. Garcia*, G.R. No. L-13160, 106 Phil. 1031, 1036 (1960))
*   Intent to injure a third person is not required in falsification of official documents; the violation of public faith is punished. Cites *Ratti v. Mendoza-De Castro, A.M. No. P-04-1844, July 23, 2004, 435 SCRA 11, 15.*
*   Judiciary employees must adhere to the highest standards of integrity.
*   The claim of good faith was rejected.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative liability for dishonesty and falsification.
*   Financial penalty of P40,000.00.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdiction over resigned employee:** Palabrica's argument that resignation divests the Court of jurisdiction was rejected, indicating the Court's authority to impose penalties even after an employee leaves service, especially when the administrative case was initiated during employment.
*   **"Good Faith" Defense:** The Court thoroughly refuted Palabrica's "good faith" argument, highlighting the importance of due diligence and the heightened responsibility of court personnel.
*   **Inadvertence vs. Intent:** The Court's emphasis on the repeated nature of the misrepresentations suggests that multiple instances of the same error can be interpreted as evidence of deliberate intent.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees)
*   Article XI of the Constitution
