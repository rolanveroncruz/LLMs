**Case:** *Roberto P. Mabini vs. Atty. Vitto A. Kintanar* (A.C. No. 9512, February 5, 2018)

**Subject:** Administrative Complaint for Misconduct against a Lawyer/Notary Public.

**Facts:**

*   Complainant (Mabini, later substituted by his heirs) alleged misconduct by Respondent (Atty. Kintanar) for notarizing an Affidavit of Loss executed by his wife, Evangeline Kintanar, in 2002.
*   The Affidavit of Loss related to a title dispute involving real property previously acquired by the Complainant.
*   Complainant argued Atty. Kintanar was prohibited from notarizing documents for relatives, including his wife, thereby constituting misconduct.
*   Atty. Kintanar countered that in 2002, the Revised Administrative Code of 1917 governed notarial practice, which didn't prohibit notarization for spouses. He further argued that the document was a mere affidavit, not a bilateral contract.

**Issue:**

Did Atty. Kintanar commit misconduct by notarizing his wife's Affidavit of Loss in 2002?

**Ruling:**

No. The Supreme Court dismissed the complaint.

**Reasoning:**

*   The Court emphasized the importance of a notary public's duties and that they were impressed with public interest.
*   **Crucially, the Court held that the applicable law at the time of the notarization (2002) was the Revised Administrative Code of 1917.** Citing *Heirs of Pedro Alilano v. Atty. Examen*, 756 Phil. 608 (2015), *Aznar Brothers Realty Co. v. Court of Appeals*, 384 Phil. 95 (2000) and *Ylaya v. Atty. Gacott*, 702 Phil. 390 (2013), The Court reiterated that the Revised Administrative Code superseded the Spanish Notarial Law of 1889 and that the prohibition against notarizing documents for relatives (as found in the later 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice) was not yet in effect.
*   The Revised Administrative Code **did not contain any prohibition** against a notary public notarizing documents executed by a spouse or relative. The Court noted that the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice came into effect *after* the document was notarized and cannot be applied retroactively to acts performed in 2002.

**Key Provisions & Legal Principles:**

*   **Governing Law:** Determination of the applicable notarial law is crucial. The 1917 Revised Administrative Code governed notarial practice in 2002.
*   **Retroactivity:** Laws and rules, including the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, generally do not apply retroactively unless expressly stated.
*   **Spouses & Notarization:** The Court confirmed that the Revised Administrative Code did not prohibit a Notary Public from notarizing a document executed by his or her spouse.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Timing is everything:** This case highlights the importance of determining the precise law in effect *at the time* of the alleged infraction.
*   **Subsequent changes in the law are irrelevant if the prior act was compliant** - The court was very clear that actions taken before the 2004 rules were to be viewed under the 1917 rules.
*   **Focus on the specific prohibitions (or lack thereof):** This case indicates strict interpretation of the statutory prohibitions.
*   **Misconduct as a lawyer vs. as a Notary Public:** While the case involves misconduct as both, the ruling hinged primarily on compliance with notarial rules at the time of notarization. There was no separate determination of whether the act of notarization itself constitutes misconduct as a lawyer independently of the notarial law.

**Conclusion:**

The Court ruled in favor of Atty. Kintanar because the act of notarizing his wife's affidavit in 2002 did not violate the notarial laws then in effect (the Revised Administrative Code of 1917). The subsequent enactment of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, which prohibits such notarizations, did not retroactively apply to his actions.
