## Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 196015, June 27, 2018 (Rural Bank of Mabitac v. Canicon and Espeleta)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging a Court of Appeals (CA) decision upholding a Regional Trial Court (RTC) order.  The root issue is the reinstatement of a previously dropped co-accused (Espeleta) in a criminal case for estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to economic sabotage.

**Key Provisions & Timeline:**

*   **2003:** Initial Information for estafa filed against Aguilar, Canicon, and Espeleta. Espeleta files motion for reinvestigation.
*   **Prosecutor Lomarda's Reinvestigation:** Recommended dismissal of charges against Espeleta and filing of amended information.
*   **RTC (Judge Cabuco-Andres) Order (Sept 17, 2003):** Granted motion to amend information, dropping Espeleta. Petitioner sought reconsideration (denied by Prosecutor).
*   **RTC (Judge Laguilles) Resolution (Nov 15, 2006):** Recalled prior order, reinstating Espeleta, arguing the reinvestigation lacked prior leave of court.
*   **RTC (Judge Baybay) Order (Oct 23, 2007):** Granted Espeleta's motion for reconsideration, reinstating the Sept 17, 2003 Order, citing prosecutorial discretion and potential double jeopardy.  Petitioner appealed.
*   **CA Decision:** Denied petitioner's certiorari petition, stating that a private prosecutor can't prosecute the criminal aspect of the case.

**Issues & Holding:**

1.  **Standing of Private Complainant (Petitioner):** The Supreme Court (SC) held that petitioner, as private complainant, *did* have standing to file a petition for certiorari challenging the dismissal of the criminal case against Espeleta, based on an alleged grave abuse of discretion and its interest in the civil aspect of the case.  Cites *Dee v. CA* (G.R. No. 111153) and *Perez v. Hagonoy Rural Bank, Inc.* (G.R. No. 126210).  Notes OSG's tacit recognition of standing by not opposing.
2.  **Double Jeopardy:** The SC held that reinstating the original information against Espeleta *would not* violate double jeopardy. Although Espeleta was arraigned, the dismissal occurred after a reinvestigation prompted by her motion, and her counsel did not object to the amendment of the information. Cites *People v. Pilpa* (G.R. No. L-30250).
3.  **Grave Abuse of Discretion by RTC:** The SC held that the RTC *did* commit grave abuse of discretion in reinstating the Sept 17, 2003 Order because the RTC *failed to make its own independent assessment* of the evidence when it allowed the amendment of the information to drop Espeleta. The RTC merely deferred to the prosecutor's recommendation without articulating any independent evaluation or assessment of the merits of the case. Cites *Crespo v. Mogul* (G.R. No. L-53373), *Martinez v. CA* (G.R. No. 112387), and *Mosquera v. Panganiban* (G.R. No. 121180).

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **RTC San Pedro, Laguna:** Ordered to resolve the motion to amend the information, explicitly stating the reasons for its resolution after considering the evidence.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Remand for Assessment:** The case is remanded to the RTC for an independent evaluation of the evidence to determine probable cause regarding Espeleta.  The outcome of this evaluation is uncertain.
*   **Prosecutorial Discretion vs. Judicial Independence:** The ruling emphasizes the importance of judicial independence in assessing prosecutorial recommendations regarding the disposition of cases.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code
*   Presidential Decree No. 1689
*   Rule 45, Rule 65, Rule 112, Rule 117 of the Rules of Court
*   Section 35(1), Book IV, Title III, Chapter 12, ADMINISTRATIVE CODE (1987)
*   *Dee v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 111153, November 21, 1994
*   *Perez v. Hagonoy Rural Bank, Inc.*, G.R. No. 126210, March 9, 2000
*   *People v. Pilpa*, G.R. No. L-30250, September 22, 1977
*   *Crespo v. Mogul*, G.R. No. L-53373, June 30, 1987
*   *Martinez v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 112387, October 13, 1994
*   *Mosquera v. Panganiban*, G.R. No. 121180, July 1996

**Conclusion:** The SC reversed the CA decision, reinstating the RTC resolution that included Espeleta as a co-accused, emphasizing the importance of independent judicial assessment of evidence and prosecutorial recommendations even after an information has been filed. The case is remanded to the RTC for a proper evaluation.
