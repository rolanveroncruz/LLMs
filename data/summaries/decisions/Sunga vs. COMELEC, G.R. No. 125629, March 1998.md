**Legal Document Summary: Sunga v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 125629 (1998)**

**Case Summary:**

This case involves a petition for certiorari filed by Manuel Sunga against the COMELEC, seeking to annul the COMELEC's dismissal of his disqualification petition against Ferdinand Trinidad, the winning mayoral candidate, based on alleged violations of the Omnibus Election Code (BP Blg. 881). Sunga accused Trinidad of vote buying, threats/intimidation, and using government vehicles for campaigning.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Sec. 261, Omnibus Election Code:** Defines prohibited acts, including vote buying (par. a), threats/intimidation (par. e), and use of government vehicles (par. o).
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 2050:** (As interpreted in *Silvestre v. Duavit*) Mandates dismissal of disqualification cases filed before the election if unresolved by election day, or cases filed after the election, before or after proclamation. The Supreme Court ultimately deemed this interpretation of COMELEC Resolution No. 2050 to be against RA No. 6646.
*   **Sec. 6, RA No. 6646:** Requires the COMELEC to continue hearing disqualification cases even after the election. It also allows the COMELEC (or court) to suspend proclamation of a candidate if evidence of guilt is strong, upon motion.
*   **Sec. 44, RA No. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Addresses permanent vacancies, stating the Vice-Mayor succeeds in cases of disqualification.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Trinidad's Potential Disqualification:** If COMELEC finds by preponderance of the evidence that the offenses have been committed, then he may be disqualified from holding office.
*   **COMELEC's Liability:** The COMELEC's failure to act on the motion to suspend proclamation is considered a breach of duty under Sec. 6 of RA No. 6646.
*   **Potential challenge to COMELEC Resolution No. 2050:** As ruled in this case, the interpretation in *Silvestre v. Duavit* may be deemed invalid for infringing on Section 6 of RA No. 6646.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code (BP Blg. 881), Sec. 261:** defines election offenses.
*   **RA No. 6646, Sec. 6:** dictates COMELEC's duty to continue disqualification cases even after the election.
*   **RA No. 7160 (Local Government Code), Sec. 44:** provides for succession in case of vacancy.
*   ***Silvestre v. Duavit, SPA No. 94-003:** Case which was used as basis by the COMELEC for dismissing the disqualification case.
*   ***Aguam v. COMELEC, No. L-28955, 28 May 1968:** Affirms COMELEC's authority to annul illegally made proclamations, even after the candidate has assumed office.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 2050:** The ambiguity lies in its interpretation. The COMELEC and the interpretation in *Silvestre v. Duavit* erroneously interpreted the Resolution as mandating dismissal of disqualification cases filed before elections but remained unresolved after. The Supreme Court clarifies that the proper procedure is to refer the case to the Law Department for investigation.
*   **Timing of the Petition:**  Trinidad argued Sunga's initial complaints weren't formal petitions. The court rejected this, holding the Amended Petition related back to the initial complaints filed before the election.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *partially granted* the petition, annulling the COMELEC resolutions that dismissed the disqualification case and ordering the COMELEC to reinstate SPA No. 95-213. The court specifically rejected Sunga's claim to be proclaimed mayor, clarifying that Trinidad's disqualification would result in a vacancy filled by the Vice-Mayor, pursuant to RA No. 7160.
