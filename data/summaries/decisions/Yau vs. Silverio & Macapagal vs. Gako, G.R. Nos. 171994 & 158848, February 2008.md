**Case Summary: *Yau v. Silverio, Sr.* (G.R. No. 158848) and *Macapagal v. Gako, Jr.* (G.R. No. 171994)**

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari concerning the enforceability of a final and executory judgment against Ricardo Silverio, Sr., and Arturo Macapagal more than five years after its finality.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Underlying Judgment:** A 1991 RTC Decision (CEB-2058) held Philfinance, Silverio, Macapagal, and others jointly and severally liable to Yau for P1,600,000 (principal), plus lost earnings, moral & exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses. This judgment stemmed from a dishonored promissory note.
*   **Rule 39, Section 6, ROC:**  Governs execution of judgments - within 5 years by motion, thereafter by independent action (revival suit) before barred by the statute of limitations.
*   **Joint and Several Liability:** Silverio and Macapagal are jointly and severally liable for the entire judgment amount.
*   **Interruption of Prescription:**  The court holds that the prescriptive period for enforcing the judgment by motion was interrupted by the judgment debtors' (Silverio and Macapagal) numerous petitions to the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court challenging the judgment and writ of execution.  These actions delayed the enforcement and therefore toll the statute of limitations.
*   **Final Judgment Modification:**  The Court of Appeals modified the award in CA-G.R. CV No. 33496 (appeal of defendants Philfinance and Pablo Carlos, Jr) deleting lost income and modifying the legal interest. However, with respect to Silverio and Macapagal, the Decision of the trial court has attained finality

**Liabilities:**

*   Silverio and Macapagal remain liable for the unsatisfied portion of the 1991 RTC judgment, as modified by the Court of Appeals, plus accrued interest. The properties levied (houses and lots) are subject to execution to satisfy this debt.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Continued Enforcement Actions:** Further execution attempts against Silverio and Macapagal's assets are imminent.
*   **Writ of Execution Challenges:**  Any further attempts to challenge the writ of execution are likely to be deemed frivolous given the repeated rulings upholding its validity.  Sanctions may be imposed.
*   **Other Creditors:** The legal document does not indicate other creditors.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 6, Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Execution of Judgments
*   **Res Judicata:**  The prior appellate court decision upholding the Order of Default bars Macapagal from relitigating the validity of the RTC Decision.
*   **Francisco Motors Corporation v. Court of Appeals (G.R. Nos. 117622-23):**  Cited for the principle that time during which execution is stayed is excluded when computing the time limit for enforcing judgment.
*   **Camacho v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 118339):** Emphasizing that delay caused by the debtor extends the time for issuing a writ.
*   **Lim v. Jabalde (G.R. No. 36786):** reiterating immutability of final judgments
*   **Lancita v. Magbanua (7 SCRA 42):** Statute of limitations only applies when execution is delayed by causes beyond control.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Quantification of Remaining Liability:**  The exact amount due under the judgment (taking into account partial satisfaction and the Court of Appeals modification) needs precise calculation. This is critical for determining the validity of the levy and auction.
*   **Definition of Interruption:** The extent and nature of the interruption caused by the debtor's actions should be analyzed.
*   **Functus Officio Argument** The legal document does not mention any challenges contesting the validity of the writ of execution.
*   **Statute of limitations**

**Outcome:**
The Supreme Court GRANTED Yau's petition (G.R. No. 158848) and DENIED Macapagal's petition (G.R. No. 171994), reversing the Court of Appeals decision favorable to Silverio and affirming the decision unfavorable to Macapagal. The RTC is directed to continue implementing the writ of execution until Yau's award is fully satisfied.
