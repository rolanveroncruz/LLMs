## Legal Document Summary: DBP vs. COA (G.R. No. 221706)

**Subject:** Disallowance of Compensation and Benefits Received by DBP Board of Directors.

**Key Issue:**  Whether the DBP Board, under Section 8 of the DBP Charter (E.O. No. 81, as amended by R.A. No. 8523), could grant themselves benefits beyond *per diems* with Presidential approval, and whether responsible officers are liable for the disallowed amounts.

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court *partially granted* the petition. While upholding the COA's disallowance of benefits exceeding *per diems*, the Court absolved the responsible officers from liability due to good faith.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Section 8, DBP Charter:**  This section governs the Board's composition, tenure, and *per diems*. DBP argued that the phrase "Unless otherwise set by the Board and approved by the President" authorized additional benefits.  COA argued the provision only relates to *per diem* amounts.
*   **Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius:** COA successfully argued that since the statute explicitly mentions *per diems* and omits other benefits, all other forms of compensation are excluded.
*   **Presidential Approval:** DBP asserted Presidential approval (notation "No Objection") validated the additional benefits. Court held this was immaterial as the Board's authority is limited by the Charter.
*   **Good Faith:** The DBP successfully argued that the approving officers acted in good faith, believing the DBP Charter permitted the benefits, and Presidential approval was obtained. They lacked knowledge of any circumstances rendering the disbursements illegal at the time. *BCDA v. COA* (599 Phil. 455 (2009).) was only decided later.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **DBP Charter (E.O. No. 81, as amended by R.A. No. 8523):**  The core statute in question.
*   ***BCDA v. COA*** **(599 Phil. 455 (2009)):** Used as precedent for interpreting similar provisions in other charters and applying the *expressio unius* doctrine. This case solidified that per diems are the standard for the board of directors when it comes to reimbursements and benefits
*   **DBM Circular Letter No. 2002-02:** Reiterated that Board members are non-salaried officials and not entitled to benefits unless expressly provided by law.
*   ***Zamboanga City Water District v. COA*** **(779 Phil. 225 (2016)):** The Supreme Court case that the DBP relied on to demonstrate the precedent set regarding good faith absolving liable officers.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "Unless otherwise set by the Board and approved by the President" in Section 8 of the DBP Charter was heavily contested. DBP's interpretation was ultimately rejected by the Court.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Future Disallowances:**  This decision reinforces that GOCC board members' compensation is strictly limited to what is explicitly authorized by statute.  Any benefits exceeding this are subject to disallowance.
*   **Liability for Refund (Mitigated in this case):** While the officers were spared from refunding in this specific instance due to good faith, future reliance on similar interpretations without clear statutory basis could result in personal liability for disallowed amounts.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the disallowance of additional benefits to DBP Board members but excused the responsible officers from personal liability for the disallowed amounts, due to good faith reliance on a reasonable, albeit ultimately incorrect, interpretation of the DBP Charter and a belief in Presidential approval. This case serves as a crucial reminder of the strict interpretation applied to GOCC board compensation, and underscores the importance of clear statutory authorization for any form of benefit.
