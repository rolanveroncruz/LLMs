## Legal Document Summary: *Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desierto, G.R. No. 145184*

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari seeking to nullify the Ombudsman's Resolution dismissing a criminal complaint for violation of Section 3(e)(g) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) regarding alleged behest loans.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Background:** The Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans (Committee), represented by the PCGG, filed a complaint against DBP Board members and officers of Integrated Circuits Philippines, Inc. (ICPI) for granting allegedly under-collateralized and undercapitalized loans to ICPI in 1980 (USD $1,352,400.00) & (PHP 1,786,000.00).
*   **Alleged Violations:** Violation of Section 3(e)(g) of RA 3019: Causing undue injury to the government or giving unwarranted benefits through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence (Sec. 3(e)); Entering into a grossly disadvantageous contract on behalf of the government (Sec. 3(g)).
*   **Ombudsman's Ruling:** Dismissed the complaint, citing prescription, the non-retroactivity of Administrative Order No. 13 and Memorandum Order No. 61 (creating the Committee and defining "behest loans"), and the lack of probable cause.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court reversed the Ombudsman's ruling on prescription and non-retroactivity but ultimately upheld the dismissal of the complaint due to a lack of probable cause.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The core issue is whether the DBP officers violated their duty to the government by approving loans that were allegedly behest loans.
*   ICPI and its officers are potentially liable if they unduly influenced the DBP officers or knowingly benefited from an illegal transaction.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Behest Loan":** The application of the criteria for determining a behest loan (Memorandum Order No. 61) is central to the case. The retrospective application of these criteria was initially contentious but deemed not an *ex post facto* law by the Court.
*   **Undue Injury & Unwarranted Benefit:** The Committee needed to prove "undue injury" to the government *and* "unwarranted benefits" to ICPI as a *direct* result of the DBP officers' actions. The Court found a lack of evidence to support these elements.
*   **Good Faith Defense:** Public officers are presumed to act in good faith. The Committee needed to prove "manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence." The Court found that the petitioners failed to prove that the conditions were specially designed in order to favor ICPI.
*    **Probable cause:** The Supreme Court noted that Petitioners failed to demonstrate that DBP did not exercise sound business judgment when it approved the loan. It said that the Committee failed to prove dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity, and conscious doing of a wrong, a breach of a sworn duty through some motive or intent, or ill will.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Section 3(e)(g):** The primary statutory basis for the alleged violations.
*   **Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desierto, 375 Phil. 697 (1999) & 415 Phil. 723 (2001):** Previous cases establishing the principle of "discovery rule" for prescription in behest loan cases.
*   **Estarija v. Ranada, G.R. No. 159314, June 26, 2006:** Jurisprudence regarding the Ombudsman's lack of jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of a law.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Grossly Disadvantageous":** The determination of whether the loan transaction was "manifestly and grossly disadvantageous" to the government is subjective and fact-dependent. The Court did not find sufficient evidence to establish this.
*   **"Undue Haste":** The allegation of "undue haste" in approving the loans was dismissed due to a lack of evidence regarding the timeline of the loan application process.

**Overall, the case highlights the difficulty in proving violations of RA 3019 in loan transactions. The decision emphasizes the need for concrete evidence of bad faith, undue injury, and a causal link between the actions of public officials and the alleged harm to the government.**
