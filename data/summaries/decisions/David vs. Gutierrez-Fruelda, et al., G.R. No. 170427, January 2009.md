**Case Summary: *David v. Judge Gutierrez-Fruelda***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 170427, January 30, 2009 (597 Phil. 354)

**Nature of Action:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 challenging RTC Orders declaring Petitioner in default in a case for accounting, reconveyance, and damages.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Claim:** Private respondents (Panlilio et al.) sued Petitioner (David), his wife, and the Register of Deeds for accounting, reconveyance, and damages, alleging fraud based on unauthorized use of a special power of attorney relating to land conversion, registration in David's name, mortgaging, and failure to remit funds.
*   **Service by Publication:** Initial service failed due to David's absence. RTC ordered service by publication.
*   **Default Order:** RTC declared David in default for failure to file an Answer within 60 days of last publication (March 19, 2005). Motion for extension was denied.
*   **Motion to Lift Default:** David moved to lift default, claiming it was disfavored and he had meritorious defenses. This was denied.
*   **RTC Rationale for Denying Motion to Lift:** David's motion was fatally flawed under Rule 9, Section 3(b) because it was not under oath, lacked an affidavit of merit, and did not allege fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence for the failure to answer.
*   **Petitioner's Arguments on Certiorari:** Grave abuse of discretion by RTC in denying to lift default order. Arguments focused on:
    *   Defective service of summons by publication (lack of proper proof of service).
    *   RTC's failure to specify a reasonable time of not less than sixty (60) days after notice for the Defendant to file his answer for extraterritorial service.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (David):** Obligation to timely file an Answer and comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 9, Section 3(b) to lift the default. He bears the burden of proving fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence and showing a meritorious defense.
*   **Private Respondents (Panlilio et al.):** Obligation to properly serve summons on the Defendant.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Jurisdictional Issues:** Petitioner raised issues regarding proper service of summons.  However, the Court held that this was waived because of the voluntary appearance (filing motions for extension and relief).
*   **Sufficiency of Motion to Lift Default:** The critical risk is the failure to strictly comply with Rule 9, Section 3(b). The lack of oath, affidavit of merit, and proper explanation for default were fatal to the motion.  The general allegation of "meritorious defense" was insufficient without supporting evidence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Certiorari as a remedy for grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Rule 9, Section 3(b) of the Rules of Court:** Requirements for lifting an order of default (oath, affidavit of merit, showing of fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence).
*   **Rule 14, Section 20 of the Rules of Court:** Voluntary appearance is equivalent to service of summons.
*   **Cezar v. Ricafort-Bautista, G.R. No. 136415, October 31, 2006, 506 SCRA 322, 334.** Voluntary appearance cures defective service of summons.
*   **St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC, 356 Phil. 811, 823-824 (1998).** Hierarchical order of courts for certiorari petitions.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court **DISMISSED** the Petition for Certiorari and **AFFIRMED** the RTC Orders. The RTC did not commit grave abuse of discretion.

**Legal Precision:**

*   The SC emphasized that the RTC's declaration of default did not amount to a grave abuse of discretion because of the petitioner's failure to comply with the requirements under Sec. 3(b), Rule 9 of the Rules of Court. Voluntary appearance cured any defects on the service of summons.
