**Legal Document Summary: *In the Matter of the Contempt Orders Against Lt. Gen. Jose M. Calimlim and Atty. Domingo A. Doctor, Jr.*, G.R. No. 141668, August 20, 2008 (584 Phil. 377)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review under Rule 45 concerning contempt orders issued by Judge Adoracion Cruz-Avisado.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   Atty. Doctor, Jr. and Lt. Gen. Calimlim (ISAFP) failed to produce Leonardo Pitao for arraignment despite promising to do so, citing security reasons and a pending Petition for Change of Venue (to SC).
*   Judge Cruz-Avisado ordered them to explain, found their explanation "highly unsatisfactory," and issued an Order admonishing Lt. Gen. Calimlim and reprimanding Atty. Doctor, Jr. (Dec 11, 1999 Order).  The Compliance was filed but not signed.
*   A Motion for Reconsideration (signed and verified) was filed, offering an apology.
*   Judge Cruz-Avisado partly granted the Motion, noting the apology and considering the Compliance as satisfactory. However, she allowed the admonition and reprimand to stand in their personnel records (Jan 20, 2000 Order).

**Issues:**

1.  Can penalties beyond those prescribed in Rule 71 for indirect contempt be imposed?
2.  Should the admonition and reprimand stand despite accepting their explanation as satisfactory?

**Holding & Rationale:**

*   The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition in part. The RTC's orders reprimanding Atty. Domingo A. Doctor, Jr. was SET ASIDE.
*   **Indirect Contempt Procedure:** The Court held that Judge Cruz-Avisado failed to follow proper procedure for indirect contempt under Rule 71, Sections 3 and 4:
    *   **Lack of Formal Charge:**  The initial order to explain did not constitute a *show cause* order for contempt. *Felizme√±a v. Galano, 216 Phil. 158 (1984)*
    *   **Satisfactory Explanation:** Even if considered a charge, the judge accepted their explanation as satisfactory, which should have ended the proceedings.  *Paredes-Garcia v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 120654, 11 September 1996, 261 SCRA 693.*
    *   **No Hearing:** No hearing was conducted, depriving petitioners of due process. *Santiago v. Anunciacion, Jr., G.R. No. 89318, 3 April 1990, 184 SCRA 118; Soriano v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 128938, 4 June 2004, 431 SCRA 1.* Contempt proceedings are quasi-criminal and require similar rights as a criminal defendant.
*   **Penalty for Indirect Contempt:**  While Rule 71, Section 7 outlines fines and imprisonment, *Racines v. Judge Morallos, A.M. MTJ-08-1698, 3 March 2008* allows lesser penalties (like reprimand) in certain circumstances.  Admonition is a warning and may be issued even without contempt proceedings.
*   The Court emphasized that the power to punish for contempt must be used sparingly and with due regard to the law and constitutional rights. *Pacuribot v. Judge Lim, 341 Phil. 544 (1997).*

**Key Obligations:**

*   Obligation to comply with court orders and commitments.
*   Duty of lawyers (Atty. Doctor, Jr.) to assist in the administration of justice.
*   Judge's obligation to follow proper procedure for indirect contempt under Rule 71.

**Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Doctor Jr. was initially penalized with reprimand for not being candid and for taking lightly his commitment to the Court, but the Supreme Court set this aside.
*   Lt. Gen. Calimlim was initially admonished to be more responsible, the Supreme Court allowed it to stand

**Potential Risks:**

*   Issuance of contempt orders without following proper procedure, risking reversal on appeal.
*   Imposition of penalties beyond those prescribed in Rule 71.
*   Due process violations in contempt proceedings, potentially invalidating the orders.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The question of what constitutes a "satisfactory explanation" in contempt proceedings, as this is subjective and fact-dependent.
*   Application of *Racines v. Judge Morallos* allowing for penalties less than fines/imprisonment, potentially leading to inconsistent application of Rule 71.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (Petition for Review)
*   Rule 71, Sections 3, 4, and 7 of the Rules of Court (Indirect Contempt)
