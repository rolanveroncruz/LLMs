Here's a concise legal summary of the provided document, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) vs. Dr. Jose Mari Del Valle Galauran* (G.R. No. 271209, August 19, 2024)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) decision setting aside PhilHealth's withdrawal of Dr. Galauran's accreditation.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Accreditation Withdrawal Authority:** The central issue is whether the PhilHealth President and CEO, or only the PhilHealth Board, possesses the authority to withdraw accreditation from a Health Care Professional (HCP). The Supreme Court (SC) affirms the CA's ruling that *only* the PhilHealth Board, exercising its quasi-judicial powers under Section 75 of the RIRR, can revoke accreditation. The president approves basic accreditation, but not revocation. PhilHealth's reliance on Sec. 62(e) of the RIRR and Board Resolution No. 2778, series of 2017, to argue that the PhilHealth President possesses revocation authority is rejected.
*   **Due Process Violation:** The SC affirms the CA's finding that PhilHealth violated Dr. Galauran's right to due process. PhilHealth failed to provide Dr. Galauran with a critical document purportedly showing he received payment for fraudulent claims, thus denying him the ability to adequately defend himself (citing *Quezon City Eye Center v. PhilHealth*).

**Relevant Statutes and Case Law:**

*   **Republic Act No. 7875 (National Health Insurance Act), as amended by RA 9241 and RA 10606:** Establishes PhilHealth and its mandate, including the power to accredit health care providers.
*   **Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of the NHIA:** Defines accreditation, outlines the process for granting and withdrawing accreditation, and details the quasi-judicial powers of the PhilHealth Board. Specifically references sections 3, 53, 59, 61, 62 and 75.
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 11223 or the Universal Health Care Act**
*   **Quezon City Eye Center v. Philippine Health Insurance Corp., G.R. Nos. 246710-15, February 6, 2023:** Establishes the minimum due process requirements, and dictates that a health care provider is entitled to know the case it has to meet.

**Alleged Violations and Liability:**

*   PhilHealth initially accused Dr. Galauran of (1) misrepresentation by furnishing false or incorrect information (Sec. 162, RIRR) and (2) breach of the warranties of accreditation/performance commitment (Sec. 163, RIRR).
*   However, SC found that the PhilHealth Arbitration Office dismissed the case against him for insufficiency of evidence.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Impact on PhilHealth's accreditation procedures:** PhilHealth argued that the CA decision would hinder the implementation of its accreditation procedures. The SC clarified the roles of the President and the Board, but the decision underscores the importance of adhering to due process requirements and ensuring sufficient evidence to support disciplinary actions.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court denied PhilHealth's petition, affirming the CA's decision. The SC found that PhilHealth unlawfully revoked Dr. Galauran's accreditation and violated his right to due process.
