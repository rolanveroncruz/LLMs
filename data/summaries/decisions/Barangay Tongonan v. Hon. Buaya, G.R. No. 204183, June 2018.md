## Legal Document Summary: *Barangay Tongonan v. Apolinario Buaya, et al.* (G.R. No. 204183)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA dismissal of a petition for annulment of court order and amicable settlement.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Barangay Tongonan, Ormoc City, represented by its Punong Barangay.
*   **Respondents:** Hon. Apolinario M. Buaya (RTC Judge), City Government of Ormoc, Municipality of Kananga, Leyte, and Philippine National Oil Company â€“ Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC).

**Key Provisions & Background:**

*   **Boundary Dispute:** Concerns a boundary dispute between Ormoc City and the Municipality of Kananga, settled via an Amicable Settlement approved by the RTC.
*   **Petitioner's Claim:** Barangay Tongonan claims the settlement illegally relinquishes a portion of its territory (325 hectares).
*   **Procedural Issues:** CA dismissed the initial petition due to procedural defects. After reinstatement, it was dismissed again based on defects in verification and certification against non-forum shopping.

**Key Issues Addressed by the Court:**

1.  **Defective Verification and Certification:** CA held that the original Barangay Council Resolution authorizing the Punong Barangay to sign the Verification and Certification was missing, there was lack of competent evidence of the representative's identity, and the document was subscribed before an Assistant Provincial Prosecutor.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   **Reversed CA decision.** Granted the petition, reinstated the case, and remanded it to the CA for proper disposition.
*   **Substantial Compliance:** Court found substantial compliance despite initial defects in the Verification and Certification against Non-Forum Shopping.
*   **Belated Submission Allowed:** Submission of the original Barangay Council Resolution, along with a new Certification and Verification by the *succeeding* Punong Barangay (due to intervening elections), attached to the motion for reconsideration, constituted substantial compliance.
*   **Preference for Substantive Justice:** Court prioritized resolving the underlying boundary dispute rather than dismissing the case on procedural technicalities.
*   **Cites Relevant Case Law:**
    *   *Mediserv, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (631 Phil. 282 (2010)).
    *   *Uy v. Land Bank of the Philippines* (391 Phil. 303 (2000)).
    *   *Havtor Management Phils. Inc. v. NLRC* (423 Phil. 509, 513 (2001)).
    *   *Fernandez v. Villegas* (741 Phil. 689, 697-698 (2014)).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Authority of Representative:** The change in Punong Barangay during the pendency of the case necessitated a new resolution. While the Court accepted this as substantial compliance, the issue of proper authorization is a critical point of contention in cases involving juridical entities. Future challenges to the new representative's authority, though unlikely after this ruling, cannot be entirely dismissed.
*   **Reliance on Substantial Compliance:** While the Court has carved out exceptions to strict compliance with procedural rules, reliance on "substantial compliance" is always a risk. The Court could have potentially determined that the deviation from the rules was too significant.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (Petition for Review on Certiorari)
*   Rule 47, Section 4 of the Rules of Court (Filing and contents of petition for annulment)
*   2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, Section 12, Rule II (Competent evidence of identity)

**Legal Precision:**

The decision clarifies the application of the doctrine of "substantial compliance" concerning verification and certification requirements in petitions for annulment, particularly when the petitioner is a juridical entity. It emphasizes that procedural rules should not be applied so rigidly as to defeat substantive justice, especially when there is evidence of good faith and a clear intention to comply.
