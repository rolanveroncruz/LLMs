## Legal Document Summary: *Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation v. Manuel N. Domingo* (G.R. No. 180765)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's denial of the Petitioner's Motion to Dismiss.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation (FBDC)
*   **Respondent:** Manuel N. Domingo (Assignee of L and M Maxco Specialist Engineering Construction, LMM Construction)

**Key Facts:**

*   FBDC entered a Trade Contract with LMM Construction for work on a condominium project.
*   The contract included a 5% retention money clause to ensure proper performance.
*   FBDC terminated the contract due to LMM Construction's defects and delays.
*   LMM Construction assigned its receivables (including retention money) to Domingo to settle a debt.
*   Prior and subsequent to the assignment, FBDC received multiple Notices of Garnishment against LMM Construction's receivables from other creditors (Asia-Con, NLRC, Concrete Masters).
*   FBDC denied Domingo's claim, stating no funds remained after rectifying defects and satisfying garnishments, however, it fully satisfied the first garnishment and another shortly after denying respondent's claim.
*   Domingo filed a collection suit against both LMM Construction and FBDC.
*   FBDC moved to dismiss, arguing CIAC jurisdiction based on the arbitration clause in the original Trade Contract.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Trade Contract:** Contains an arbitration clause requiring disputes to be resolved by the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC).
*   **Retention Money Clause:**  FBDC had the right to withhold 5% of the contract price as retention money for one year post-completion to cover corrective work.
*   **Deed of Assignment:** LMM Construction assigned its receivables from FBDC to Domingo to settle a debt of P804,068.21.
*   **Garnishment Orders:**  FBDC received multiple notices of garnishment against LMM Construction's receivables.  FBDC had a duty to deliver funds per these orders, subject to priority rules.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **FBDC's Potential Liability to Domingo:** Domingo argues FBDC should have prioritized his assignment claim *before* fully satisfying later garnishments, claiming FBDC's actions depleted funds that should have been allocated to him. Domingo's complaint arises from the alleged improper exercise of discretion by the petitioner in giving preference to other creditors of LMM Construction over the receivables of the latter.
*   **Risk of Double Payment:** FBDC potentially faces the risk of paying twice if the RTC finds it improperly prioritized garnishments over Domingo's assignment.
*   **LMM Construction's Liability to Domingo:** LMM Construction remains liable to Domingo for the debt.
*   **Impact of Garnishment Orders:** The garnishment orders create a legal obligation for FBDC to withhold funds and pay creditors of LMM Construction, potentially depleting funds otherwise payable to LMM Construction or its assignee.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Executive Order No. 1008 (CIAC Law):** Defines the jurisdiction of the CIAC, limiting it to construction-related disputes arising from contracts.
*   **Article 1311 of the Civil Code (Relativity of Contracts):** Addresses the principle that contracts bind only the parties, their assigns, and heirs.
*   ***Megaworld Globus Asia, Inc. v. DSM Construction and Development Corporation, 468 Phil. 305, 321 (2004)*:** Defines retention money in the context of construction contracts.
*   ***Serdoncillo v. Benolirao, 358 Phil. 83, 95 (1998)*:** Outlines that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations of the complaint.
*   ***Gammon Philippines, Inc. v. Metro Rail Transit Development Corporation, G.R. No. 144792, 31 January 2006, 481 SCRA 209, 218-219:* Defines construction.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Priority of Claims:** The central dispute hinges on the priority of claims between Domingo (as assignee) and the garnishing creditors. Philippine law on assignment of credits and preference of credits is directly relevant.
*   **Jurisdictional Dispute:**  Whether the RTC or CIAC has jurisdiction is heavily debated.  FBDC argues that the arbitration clause binds Domingo as LMM Construction's assignee, thus vesting jurisdiction in the CIAC. Domingo argues that the claim is not related to the trade contract and should be heard in the RTC.
*   **FBDC's Discretion:** Domingo is challenging FBDC's "purportedly arbitrary exercise of discretion" in prioritizing the garnishment orders.

**Court Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court held that the RTC has jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 06-0200-CFM. The court ruled that since Domingo's claim springs not from a violation of the provisions of the Trade Contract, but from the non-payment of the monetary obligation of LMM Construction to him. His right to receive payment for the financial obligation incurred by LMM Construction and to be preferred over the other creditors of LMM Construction, a right which pre-existed and, thus, was separate and distinct from the right to payment of LMM Construction under the Trade Contract.

**Potential Arguments for Domingo:**

*   Perfected Assignment: Argument that the Deed of Assignment was validly executed and perfected, giving him a vested right to the receivables.
*   Notice to FBDC:  Argument that FBDC was properly notified of the assignment *before* it fully satisfied later garnishment orders.
*   Bad Faith: Impute bad faith on FBDC's part for allegedly prioritizing other creditors.

**Potential Arguments for FBDC:**

*   Bona Fide Compliance: FBDC can argue that it acted in good faith and was legally obligated to comply with the garnishment orders as they were served.
*   Lack of Notice of Assignment: (Weaker argument) Argue that notice of the assignment was somehow deficient or untimely, though the facts indicate otherwise.

This summary provides a framework for a more detailed legal analysis. It highlights the key aspects of the document, potential legal issues, and relevant arguments for each party. Further investigation into the specific timelines, the nature of the garnishment orders, and applicable jurisprudence regarding assignment and preference of credits is recommended.
