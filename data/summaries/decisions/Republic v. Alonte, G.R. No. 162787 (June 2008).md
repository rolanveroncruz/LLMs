## Legal Document Summary: Republic v. Alonte, G.R. No. 162787, June 13, 2008

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision, Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45).

**Case Summary:**  This case involves a petition by the Republic to reverse the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision granting Lourdes F. Alonte's petition for reconstitution of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 335986. The original TCT was destroyed in a fire, and the owner's duplicate was lost.

**Key Provisions/Holdings:**

*   **Affirmation of Lower Court Findings:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's decision, holding that the lower courts' factual findings regarding the sufficiency of evidence for reconstitution are generally binding on the SC unless compelling reasons exist to deviate from this rule. *Republic of the Philippines v. Casimiro, G.R. No. 166139, June 20, 2006, 491 SCRA 499*.  No such compelling reasons were found.
*   **Jurisdictional Compliance with R.A. No. 26:** The SC determined that Alonte's petition *did* comply with the mandatory requirements of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 26, "An Act Providing a Special Procedure for the Reconstitution of Torrens Certificate of Title Lost or Destroyed."
    *   Allegations re: occupants, adjoining owners, and interested parties were deemed sufficient based on attached documents. The court noted that the petitioner had stated the title was free of any and all liens and encumbrances.
    *   Restrictions/liabilities: the court stated that this was part of the copy of the TCT attached to the petition.
    *   Technical description requirement: the court observed that the petition was accompanied by a technical description approved by the Commissioner of the National Land Titles and Deeds Registration Administration, which is compliant with Section 12 of R.A. 26. Also, the Land Registration Authority (LRA) had favorably reported on the technical description.
*   **Sufficiency of Photocopy:** The CA did not err in upholding the RTC's order for reconstitution based on a photocopy of the TCT, pursuant to Section 3(f) of R.A. No. 26, which allows reconstitution from "any other document which, in the judgment of the court, is sufficient and proper basis."

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 26:** *An Act Providing a Special Procedure for the Reconstitution of Torrens Certificate of Title Lost or Destroyed.*  Sections 3(f), 12 and 13 are particularly relevant.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Petition for Review on Certiorari procedure
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 131, Sec. 3:** Presumption that official duty has been regularly performed.
*   **New Civil Code, Article 524:** Provides that possession can be exercised in one's own name or in that of another.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Attorney-in-Fact's Possession:**  The government argued that the attorney-in-fact's possession contradicted the petitioner's claim of possession.  However, the court rejected this argument.
*   **Missing Tracing Cloth Plan:** The government raised an issue related to non-compliance with Circular 35 for failure to provide a tracing cloth plan. This was resolved because of the fact that the LRA's Report was favorable to the petitioner.
*   **Compliance with R.A. 26 regarding a detailed list of encumbrances:** There may be residual risk that potential but undiscovered encumbrances may be an issue. However, this risk is mitigated if a copy of the TCT was actually attached.
*   **Official Gazette Publication:** The petitioner must prove that the publication requirement has been strictly met. Otherwise, there will be a jurisdictional defect.

**Obligations:**

*   **Register of Deeds (Quezon City):** Obligated to reconstitute the original copy of TCT No. 335986 and issue a new owner's duplicate copy to Alonte, upon payment of prescribed fees and the finality of the order.

**Liabilities:**

*   None explicitly stated. However, the Register of Deeds could face potential liability for non-compliance with the reconstitution order.

**Overall Assessment:**

The SC decision favors the reconstitution of the title. The Court's reliance on the lower courts' factual findings and the favorable LRA report strengthens Alonte's claim. The risks seem relatively low, but proper documentation and compliance with registration procedures are still crucial.
