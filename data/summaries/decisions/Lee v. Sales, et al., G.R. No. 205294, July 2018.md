## Legal Document Summary: *Lee v. Sales* (G.R. No. 205294)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a RTC Order dismissing a petition for injunction/prohibition against the immediate execution of an Ombudsman decision dismissing a public officer (Elmer P. Lee) from service.

**Key Issue:** Whether a pending Motion for Reconsideration (MR) stays the execution of an Ombudsman decision dismissing a public officer. Whether the RTC has jurisdiction over a petition for prohibition/injunction to stop execution of an Ombudsman decision.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied the Petition, affirming the RTC's dismissal. A pending MR does not stay the execution of an Ombudsman decision. The RTC lacks jurisdiction to enjoin the execution of the Ombudsman's decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Ombudsman Administrative Order No. 7 (as amended by AO 17), Rule III, Section 7 & Memorandum Circular No. 01, Series of 2006:** Explicitly states that decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative cases are immediately executory, even pending a motion for reconsideration or petition for review. Only a TRO or Writ of Preliminary Injunction from a competent court can stay execution.
*   **Obligation to Implement:** Respondents (BIR officials) had a legal duty to implement the Ombudsman's decision dismissing Elmer P. Lee. Failure to do so would subject them to disciplinary action.
*   **Remedy:** Petitioner's proper remedy was to file a mandamus action to compel the Ombudsman to rule on MR within 5 days and/or appeal to CA if MR denied.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioner's Dismissal:** The immediate execution of the dismissal order means Elmer P. Lee is no longer employed by the BIR.
*   **Forfeiture of Benefits:** Elmer P. Lee forfeits all benefits, except accrued leave credits, with prejudice to reemployment in the government.
*   **Preventive Suspension Analogy:** The Court analogized immediate execution to preventive suspension, protecting the civil service from potentially compromising actions by the disciplined officer.
*   **Risk of Disciplinary Action for Non-Compliance:** Respondents faced disciplinary action if they failed to implement the Ombudsman's dismissal order.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6770:** Empowers the Ombudsman to promulgate rules of procedure.
*   **Article XI, Section 13 of the 1987 Constitution:** Grants the Ombudsman rule-making power.
*   **Rule 43 of the Rules of Court:** Provides for appeal to the Court of Appeals.
*   **Overruled *Lapid v. Court of Appeals*:** Prior case law suggesting a stay of execution was explicitly overturned by subsequent jurisprudence (e.g., *In the Matter to Declare in Contempt of Court Hon. Simeon A. Datumanong*, *Buencamino v. Court of Appeals*, *Ombudsman v. Samaniego*).
*   **Distinguished *JP Latex Technology, Inc. v. Ballons Granger Balloons, Inc.*:** Not applicable because the present case is governed by Ombudsman rules, not the Rules of Court governing civil cases.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **None:** The legal principles are well-established in existing law and jurisprudence, leaving little room for ambiguity or dispute regarding the interpretation of relevant provisions.
*   **Lack of Vested Right in Public Office:** The Court emphasized that there is no vested right to a public office that would be violated by immediate execution, highlighting a key principle in public service law.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

*Lee v. Sales* confirms the immediate executory nature of Ombudsman decisions in administrative cases, even pending MR. Citing AO 7 (amended by AO 17) and MC No. 01, S. 2006, the Court reiterates that only a TRO or Writ of Preliminary Injunction can stay execution. *Lapid* has been explicitly overruled. The correct recourse is mandamus to compel a ruling on MR, followed by appeal to the CA under Rule 43. Emphasize lack of vested right in public office.
