## Legal Document Summary: *Buenavista Properties, Inc. v. Atty. Amado B. Deloria* (A.C. No. 12160)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Deloria for alleged violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

**Key Issues:** Conflict of interest, forum shopping, and neglect of client duties.

**Facts:**

*   BPI (Buenavista Properties, Inc.) and LSDC (La Savoie Development Corporation, represented by Atty. Deloria) entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) for land development.
*   Disputes arose, and BPI filed a civil case against LSDC in the RTC. Atty. Deloria, on behalf of LSDC, filed a counterclaim seeking mandatory injunction for BPI to execute deeds of sale. This was denied.
*   Atty. Deloria, on behalf of LSDC, then filed a separate case before the HLURB seeking the same relief.
*   Simultaneously, Atty. Deloria represented lot buyers in HLURB cases against BPI, including some who had previously filed an estafa case against the President of LSDC.
*   One lot buyer, Corazon Flores, submitted an affidavit stating Atty. Deloria neglected her case before the HLURB.

**Key Provisions/Violations of CPR:**

*   **Rules 15.01 & 15.03 (Conflict of Interest):**  Atty. Deloria represented conflicting interests by simultaneously representing LSDC and lot buyers with adverse claims. Specifically, representing both the President of LSDC in an estafa case filed by Corazon Flores, and representing Corazon in a later case against BPI where LSDC was a third party. No written consent obtained from all parties after full disclosure. *Hornilla v. Salunat*, 453 Phil. 108 (2003) provides the test for conflict of interest.
*   **Rule 12.02 (Forum Shopping):**  Atty. Deloria sought the same relief (mandatory injunction for execution of deeds) in the HLURB case after the RTC denied it in the initial civil action. Litis pendentia was present.
*   **Canon 17 & Rules 18.03 & 18.04 (Neglect of Client Duties):** Atty. Deloria neglected Corazon Flores' case, failed to communicate, and did not file necessary pleadings, violating his duty of diligence and communication. *Pilapil v. Carillo*, 443 Phil. 193 (2003) and *Quiachon v. Ramos*, 735 Phil. 1 (2014) provide precedent for penalties in cases of neglect.

**Respondent's Defenses:**

*   Lack of influence as HLURB Commissioner at the time of initial approvals.
*   Desire to help lot buyers obtain titles.
*   Reliance on LSDC staff for service of HLURB notice.
*   Inapplicability of RA 6713 (Code of Conduct) due to time lapse.
*   Challenged BPI's standing to sue and lack of board resolution.

**IBP Findings:**

*   Found Atty. Deloria liable for conflict of interest, forum shopping, and neglect of client duties.
*   Recommended a two-year suspension.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   Upheld the IBP's findings.
*   **Held Atty. Deloria GUILTY** of violating Rules 15.01 & 15.03, Rule 12.02, Canon 17, and Rules 18.03 & 18.04 of the CPR.
*   **Suspended him from the practice of law for two (2) years**, effective upon receipt of the decision.

**Statutory References:**

*   Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR)
*   Republic Act No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees) Section 7(b) - although ultimately found inapplicable due to the passage of time.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The simultaneous representation of the President of LSDC and a lot buyer with a pending criminal case against the President created a clear conflict of interest.
*   Filing the same claim in HLURB after RTC denial presents a strong case for forum shopping.
*   The lack of communication and diligence demonstrated in Corazon Flores' case strengthens the finding of neglect.

**Case Law References:**

*   *Hornilla v. Salunat*, 453 Phil. 108 (2003) (Conflict of Interest test)
*   *Palacios v. Amora, Jr., A.C. No. 11504, August 1, 2017*
*   *Gonzales v. Cabucana, Jr., 515 Phil. 296, 306 (2006)*
*   *Romero v. Evangelista, Jr., A.C. No. 11829, February 26, 2018*
*   *Teodoro III v. Gonzales, 702 Phil. 422, 428 (2013)*
*   *Williams v. Enriquez*, 769 Phil. 666 (2015).
*   *Pilapil v. Carillo*, 443 Phil. 193 (2003).
*   *Quiachon v. Ramos*, 735 Phil. 1 (2014).

**Conclusion:**

Atty. Deloria's actions constitute serious violations of the CPR, justifying the two-year suspension. The Court emphasized the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest, preventing forum shopping, and diligently representing clients. This case serves as a warning to attorneys against engaging in such conduct.
