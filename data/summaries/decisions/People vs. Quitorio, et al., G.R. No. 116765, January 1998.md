## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Quitorio*, G.R. No. 116765

**Nature:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Jacob Quitorio, Jayson Pomida, and Pacificador Campomanes of Rape with Homicide. The Supreme Court addressed the appeals of only Quitorio and Pomida due to Campomanes' failure to surrender.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Amended Information:** Accused were charged with conspiring to rape and murder Elena Dacutanan.
*   **RTC Decision:** Found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt based on circumstantial evidence. Sentenced Quitorio and Pomida to two terms of *reclusion perpetua* plus an additional term of imprisonment. Campomanes, being a youthful offender, received a reduced sentence of *reclusion temporal* for the count of personally committing the crime, but with an additional of two more terms of imprisonment for the count of conspiracy with the two other accused. The decision also included an order for the accused to indemnify the heirs of the victim *jointly and severally* for actual, moral, and exemplary damages, as well as costs.

**Liabilities:**

*   **RTC Ruling:** Accused found liable for Rape with Homicide under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended. Each accused was held liable for three offenses due to conspiracy: one that was personally committed by him and the others that were committed by the other two.
*   The lower court also ordered that the accused pay a sum of P50,000.00 as actual damages for the death of the said victim; P75,000.00 as moral damages; P25,000.00, as exemplary damages; P7,100.00 also representing the total actual expenses in connection with the death of the victim Elena Gabane.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Conviction based heavily on the testimony of Yolanda Caspe, whose credibility is strongly challenged by the Supreme Court due to inconsistencies and improbabilities in her statements.
*   **Medical Evidence:** The Supreme Court found the medical evidence (specifically regarding rape) to be weak and the doctor's testimony unconvincing, undermining the foundation for the "rape with homicide" charge.
*   **Application of Penalties:** The Supreme Court criticized the RTC's misapplication of the Revised Penal Code regarding the duration of *reclusion perpetua* and the proper computation of penalties, particularly concerning the effect of mitigating circumstances (minority) on co-conspirators.
* **Improper application of R.A. No. 7659, an Act to Impose the Death Penalty on Certain Heinous Crimes, Amending for the Purpose the Revised Penal Code, as Amended, Other Special Penal Laws, and For Other Purposes.** The penalty of death provided under the governing law then was deemed reduced to reclusion perpetua; however, for purposes of determining the proper penalty because of the mitigating circumstance of minority, the penalty of death was still the penalty to be reckoned with.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335, Revised Penal Code:** Rape with Homicide.
*   **Article 27, Revised Penal Code:** Duration of penalties, including *reclusion perpetua*.

*   ***People v. Mu√±oz***: Constitutional prohibition did not alter periods for the penalty for murder for purposes of determining the proper imposable penalty.
* R.A. No. 7659, entitled An Act to Impose the Death Penalty on Certain Heinous Crimes, Amending for the Purpose the Revised Penal Code, as Amended, Other Special Penal Laws, and For Other Purposes.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court **reversed** the RTC decision and **acquitted** Quitorio and Pomida due to reasonable doubt. The Court ordered their immediate release.

**Legal Precision:**

*   The court meticulously dissects the prosecution's evidence, emphasizing the high standard of proof ("beyond reasonable doubt") required in criminal cases. It scrutinizes the credibility of key witnesses and the reliability of expert testimony, highlighting the importance of consistent and believable evidence. The decision also corrects the RTC's erroneous application of penal code provisions.
