## Legal Document Summary: Associated Bank v. Court of Appeals and Lorenzo Sarmiento Jr.

**Case:** G.R. No. 123793, June 29, 1998 (353 Phil. 702)

**Issue:** Whether the surviving corporation in a merger (Associated Bank) can enforce a promissory note executed in favor of the absorbed company (Citizens Bank and Trust Company - CBTC) *after* the merger agreement but *before* the SEC issued the certificate of merger.

**Holding:** Yes, Associated Bank can enforce the promissory note.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Merger Agreement (September 16, 1975):** Governs the merger between Associated Banking Corporation (ABC) and CBTC, forming Associated Citizens Bank (later renamed Associated Bank).
*   **Promissory Note (September 7, 1977):** Lorenzo Sarmiento Jr. executed a promissory note in favor of CBTC for P2,500,000, payable by March 6, 1978, with 14% annual interest and additional charges for default.
*   **Merger Agreement Clauses:**
    *   Effectiveness of the merger contingent upon SEC approval.
    *   Transfer of all CBTC's rights, privileges, powers, assets, and properties to ABC upon the effective date of the merger.
    *   Specifically, *all references* to CBTC in any documents, whenever found, are to be deemed references to ABC, the surviving bank.
*   **Obligations:** Sarmiento failed to fully pay the promissory note and owes Associated Bank the outstanding balance.

**Liabilities:**

*   Sarmiento is liable to Associated Bank for the outstanding principal, interest, and attorney's fees, as per the promissory note.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timing of SEC Approval:** The exact date the SEC approved the merger is not explicitly stated, but the court ruled the date irrelevant due to the clause making any reference to CBTC in any document a reference to Associated Bank
*   **Sarmiento's Defenses (Rejected):**
    *   Lack of cause of action/improper party in interest: Rejected because the merger agreement stipulates that all contracts in CBTC's name are enforceable by Associated Bank.
    *   Prescription/Laches: Rejected because the lawsuit was filed within the 10-year statute of limitations for actions on written contracts.
    *   Contract pour autrui: Rejected as the promissory note did not expressly confer benefits on a third party.
    *   Lack of consideration: Rejected because the signed promissory note is sufficient evidence of consideration.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 79, Corporation Code:**  Requires SEC approval of the articles of merger for it to be effective.
*   **Article 1149 & 1144, Civil Code:** Defines prescription periods
*   **Article 1311, Civil Code:** Defines Contracts pour autrui
*   **Verba legis non est recedendum:** Clear and unambiguous provisions in the contract should be applied literally.

**Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The timing of the SEC approval of the merger is not contained within the document.

**Analysis & Legal Precision:**

The court prioritized the *intent* of the merger agreement, specifically the clause designed to prevent evasion of obligations due to the corporate restructuring. This decision emphasizes the importance of comprehensive merger agreements that anticipate future contracts and ensure the seamless transfer of rights and obligations.

**Key Takeaway:**  A well-drafted merger agreement, with clear provisions addressing post-merger contracts, is crucial for ensuring the surviving corporation can enforce the rights and obligations of the absorbed company. The court upheld the validity of such provisions, even when the relevant contract was executed *after* the merger agreement but *before* SEC issued its certificate.
