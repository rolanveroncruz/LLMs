## Legal Document Summary - People v. Lopez, G.R. No. 179714

**Case Summary:** This is a statutory rape case where Appellant Rodolfo Lopez was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt by the RTC and affirmed by the CA for violating Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353. The victim, BBB, was four years old at the time of the offense.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 335, Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines and penalizes rape, specifically statutory rape involving a victim under 12 years old, regardless of force or intimidation. The prosecution successfully demonstrated all elements of the crime were met.
*   **RA 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, resulting in the reduction of the initial death sentence to *reclusion perpetua*. The decision also states the defendant is not eligible for parole.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant's Obligation:** To serve *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Appellant's Financial Liabilities:** Payment of civil indemnity (P75,000.00), moral damages (P75,000.00), and exemplary damages (P30,000.00) to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Appellant's Defense:** The defense argued that the conviction was based on the weakness of their evidence rather than the strength of the prosecution's case. The Court dismissed this argument, asserting that the prosecution presented credible evidence, including the victim's testimony and medical findings.
*   **Victim's Testimony:** The victim's testimony was considered direct and straightforward, bolstered by her age (credible due to lack of motive) and consistency during cross-examination. The Court relies on the credibility attributed by the RTC.
*   **Medical Evidence:** The medical examination, which revealed a superficial hymenal laceration, corroborated the victim's account and supported the finding of carnal knowledge.
*   **Parole Eligibility:** The decision explicitly states the appellant is *not eligible for parole* due to the heinous nature of the crime and the reduction of the penalty due to RA 9346.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 335 (as amended by RA 8353):**  Governs the definition and penalties for rape, specifically statutory rape.
*   **RA 9346:** An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of the Death Penalty in the Philippines, which caused a reduction in the appellant's penalty from death to reclusion perpetua.
*   **People v. Jalosjos, 421 Phil. 43, 54 (2001):** Affirms the odious nature of rape against a minor.
*   **People v. Salome (G.R. No. 169077, August 31, 2006, 500 SCRA 659) and People v. Quiachon (G.R. No. 170236, August 31, 2006, 500 SCRA 704):**  Discusses the basis for awarding damages in rape cases, particularly the consideration of the heinous nature of the crime, and the penalty it warrants, irrespective of the actual punishment meted.
*   **People v. Achas, G.R. No. 185712, August 4, 2009:** Addresses the implications of RA 9346 on parole eligibility in cases where the death penalty would have been warranted.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   There are no particularly ambiguous clauses. However, the reduction of penalty due to RA 9346 while maintaining the severity of damages awarded (based on the initial consideration for the death penalty) reflects a potential tension in applying the law and maintaining justice for the victim.
