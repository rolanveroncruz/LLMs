Okay, here's a concise legal summary of *Navarra v. Office of the Ombudsman*, G.R. No. 176291, December 4, 2009, formatted in markdown:

**Case Summary: *Navarra v. Office of the Ombudsman***

**Facts:**

*   FENICS (represented by Petitioner Navarra) leased property from FTI.
*   FTI (through Respondents Namanama, Lazaro, and Medina) forcibly re-entered and took over the leased premises, allegedly due to unpaid rentals, while using armed personnel and welding gates shut.
*   Navarra filed a complaint with the Ombudsman for grave coercion, malicious mischief and/or grave threats against the Respondents.

**Issue:**

*   Whether the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing Navarra's complaint for grave coercion.

**Holding:**

*   Yes. The Supreme Court (SC) *granted* the petition, set aside the Ombudsman's order, and directed the Ombudsman to file an information for grave coercion against the respondents.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** The agreement contained clauses allowing FTI to rescind the lease and re-enter the premises upon default of rental payments without judicial intervention.
*   **Compromise Agreement:** FENICS agreed to pay outstanding obligations, with a clause allowing FTI to rescind the lease upon default of payments.
*   **Article 286, Revised Penal Code (Grave Coercion):** Elements are: (1) preventing someone from doing a lawful act or compelling them to do an unlawful act; (2) prevention/compulsion through violence, threats, or intimidation; (3) lack of legal authority to restrain will/liberty.
*   **Article 536, Civil Code:** In no case may possession be acquired through force or intimidation as long as there is a possessor who objects.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondents are potentially liable for grave coercion under Article 286 RPC, for actions taken during the repossession.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Extrajudicial Repossession:** The core issue is the *method* of repossession. Despite contractual clauses allowing rescission and re-entry, the SC emphasized that FTI *cannot* resort to force, intimidation, or violence. This underscores the prohibition against taking the law into one's own hands.
*   **Ambiguity of "Without Need of Judicial Action":** The lease and compromise agreements contained provisions that FTI was entitled to rescind the lease contracts "without need of judicial action or intervention" if FENICS defaulted. FTI interpreted this provision to mean they were entitled to repossess the property using force and intimidation.
*   **Defense of Good Faith:** The Ombudsman argued that respondents acted in good faith. The SC rejected this reasoning, stating that good faith is a matter of defense to be raised during trial, not during preliminary investigation.
*   **University of the Philippines v. de los Angeles Distinction:** The SC distinguished the case from *University of the Philippines v. de los Angeles*, noting that the present case involved allegations of violence, threats, and intimidation, which were absent in *de los Angeles.*

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 286 (Grave Coercion)**
*   **Civil Code, Article 536**
*   **United States v. Mena, 11 Phil. 543 (1908):**  Cited to reiterate that one cannot take the law into their own hands, even if they believe they have a right to possession.
*   **University of the Philippines v. de los Angeles, G.R. No. L-28602, September 29, 1970, 35 SCRA 102:** Distinguished based on the absence of violence or intimidation in the earlier case.

**Key Takeaway:** Contractual rights to rescind a lease do not supersede the prohibition against using force, intimidation, or violence to repossess property. The party must seek judicial recourse instead of taking the law into its own hands. The SC emphasized that a preliminary investigation is not the venue to argue good faith defenses; those are best presented during trial.
