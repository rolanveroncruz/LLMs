**Case Summary: *Makati Stock Exchange, Inc. v. Campos*, G.R. No. 138814, April 16, 2009**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals' decision which nullified the SEC en banc's orders dismissing Miguel Campos' petition against Makati Stock Exchange (MKSE) and its directors.

**Key Issue:** Whether Campos' petition before the SEC sufficiently stated a cause of action.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that Campos' petition *failed* to state a cause of action and reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, reinstating the SEC en banc's dismissal.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Campos' Claim:** Campos alleged he was improperly denied his equal share of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) by MKSE, seeking nullification of the MKSE Board Resolution, delivery of IPO shares, and damages. He claimed this right based on his position as Chairman Emeritus and past practice.
*   **MKSE's Argument:** MKSE argued that the petition was moot, the SICD lacked jurisdiction, and that it failed to state a cause of action. They argued that the allocation of IPOs to Campos was a mere accommodation, not a legal entitlement.
*   **Cause of Action Analysis:** The Court reiterated the elements of a cause of action: (1) a legal right of the plaintiff, (2) a correlative obligation of the defendant, and (3) an act or omission violating that right.
*   **Lack of Source of Right/Obligation:** The Court found that while Campos asserted a right to IPO allocations and a corresponding obligation of MKSE to provide them, he failed to establish the *source* of that right or obligation within the meaning of Article 1157 of the Civil Code (law, contract, quasi-contract, delict, or quasi-delict).  The Court noted he based his claim on Resolution recognizing him as Chairman Emeritus and an alleged common practice.
*   **Custom vs. Legal Right:** The Court emphasized that a mere practice or custom is generally *not* a source of a legally enforceable right.  While certain labor benefits can ripen into enforceable rights under the Labor Code, no analogous statutory provision existed in this case to transform the practice of allocating IPO shares into a legal entitlement.
*   **Hypothetical Admission:** While a motion to dismiss admits the facts alleged, it only applies to "relevant and material facts well pleaded in the complaint." The lack of a legal basis for the claimed right rendered the claim insufficient, even with hypothetical admission of the facts.

**Relevant Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1157 of the Civil Code:** Enumerates the sources of obligations.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 2, Section 2:** Defines cause of action.
*   **Labor Code, Article 100:** Cited as an example of a statute that can convert a voluntary benefit into an enforceable right in specific contexts.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Practice":** The decision highlights the difficulty of converting established practices into legally binding obligations without a clear legal basis. This creates uncertainty for parties relying on customary actions.
*   **Differing interpretations of the resolution**: Campos argued that it was his understanding that this conferred the right to IPO shares.

**Case Law:**

*   The court cites **Fil-Estate Golf and Development, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 333 Phil. 465, 490-491 (1996)**, on the test for sufficiency of facts constituting a cause of action.
*   **Arco Metal Products Co., Inc. v. Samahan ng mga Manggagawa sa Arco Metal-NAFLU, G.R. No. 170734, 14 May 2008, 554 SCRA 110, 118.**, the court illustrates that in some cases, custom can be a source of right, specifically, if the law deems it so.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court prioritized the requirement for a clear legal basis for a claimed right and obligation, even in the context of established business practices.  The decision serves as a reminder that reliance on custom alone, without a grounding in law, contract, or other legal source, may be insufficient to sustain a cause of action. The fact the Respondent was recognized as the "Chairman Emeritus" did not automatically bestow the right to receive IPO allocations.
