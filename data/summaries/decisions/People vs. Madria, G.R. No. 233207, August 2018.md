## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Madria y Higayon* (G.R. No. 233207, August 20, 2018)

This Supreme Court decision reverses the Court of Appeals' affirmation of the RTC's conviction of Anthony Madria for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002). The Court *acquits* Madria based on the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt due to significant breaks in the chain of custody of the seized drugs and non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violations:** Charges stemmed from a buy-bust operation where Madria allegedly sold shabu to a poseur-buyer (Section 5) and was found in possession of additional shabu (Section 11).
*   **Chain of Custody:** The Court found multiple critical gaps in the prosecution's evidence regarding the chain of custody of the seized items.
*   **Section 21, R.A. 9165 Non-Compliance:** The decision highlights the failure of the arresting officers to strictly adhere to the procedural requirements outlined in Section 21 and its IRR regarding:
    *   **Immediate Marking:** The seized items were not marked immediately after seizure and confiscation, *in the presence of* the accused, as mandated. The officers' "security" concerns were deemed insufficient justification. Referencing *People v. Gayoso* and *People v. Beran y Zapanta*, the decision emphasizes that "marking is the starting point in the custodial link."
    *   **Inventory and Photographing:** The inventory and photographing of the seized items were not conducted at the place of seizure or the nearest police station immediately after seizure. Critically, these procedures were not performed in the presence of the accused, a representative from the media, a representative from the Department of Justice (DOJ), or any elected public official, as required. *People v. Macud* is cited to support the presence of the persons who should witness the post-operation procedures is necessary to insulate the apprehension and incrimination proceedings from any taint of illegitimacy or irregularity
    *   **Lack of Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution failed to adequately demonstrate "justifiable grounds" for the numerous deviations from Section 21 requirements.
*   **Co-mingling of Evidence:** Testimony revealed that the sachet of shabu allegedly sold in the buy-bust operation was co-mingled with the other six sachets, further compromising the integrity of the evidence. *People v. Ismael* is cited for its holding that failure to mark the drugs immediately after they were seized from the accused casts doubt on the prosecution evidence warranting an acquittal on reasonable doubt."
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court rejects the prosecution's reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, noting that the numerous irregularities surrounding the buy-bust operation render this presumption inapplicable. Citing *Cariño et al v. People*, any taint of irregularity affects the whole performance and should make the presumption unavailable.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Justifiable Grounds":** The decision underscores the need for concrete evidence to support claims of "justifiable grounds" for non-compliance with Section 21. The Court will not assume the existence of such reasons.
*   **Impact on Future Cases:** This decision reinforces the importance of strict adherence to the procedural requirements of R.A. 9165 and its IRR in drug cases. Law enforcement agencies must ensure that their personnel are thoroughly trained on these procedures to avoid acquittals based on chain of custody violations.
*   **Defense Strategy:** Defense counsel in future drug cases can effectively use this decision to challenge the admissibility of evidence seized in buy-bust operations where procedural safeguards were not strictly followed.
