**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. SPO1 Arnulfo A. Aure and SPO1 Marlon H. Ferol*, G.R. No. 180451, October 17, 2008.

**Summary:** This is a review of the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the conviction of SPO1 Aure and SPO1 Ferol for two counts of rape under Republic Act No. 8353. The RTC found Aure guilty of raping AAA on November 7, 1999, and Ferol guilty of raping AAA on November 8, 1999, both incidents occurring at the CIDG office. The CA affirmed in toto the RTC ruling.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Crime:** Rape under RA 8353, committed through force and intimidation.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion perpetua imposed on each appellant, affirmed by the Supreme Court.
*   **Civil Liabilities:** Civil indemnity of P50,000.00, moral damages of P50,000.00, and attorney's fees of P70,000.00 (jointly) awarded to the victim, AAA.
*   **Police Custody:** Agravating circumstance but it was not specifically alleged in the informations.

**Liabilities:**

*   SPO1 Arnulfo A. Aure is liable for rape committed on November 7, 1999.
*   SPO1 Marlon H. Ferol is liable for rape committed on November 8, 1999.
*   Joint liability for attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Date Discrepancy:** The information in Criminal Case No. C-58693 alleges the rape occurred on November 7, 1999, but Ferol was convicted based on the victim's testimony that it occurred on November 8, 1999. The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, citing that the date is not a material element of rape, and the variance was only one day. The possible appeal point is the variance between what's stated in the charge and the conviction.
*   **Lack of Conspiracy Finding:** The informations allege conspiracy, but the RTC found none, convicting each appellant individually. The court held they were individually responsible for their actions.
*   **Alleged Bias of the Trial Court:** The appellants raised allegations of bias and partiality on the part of the RTC judge. However, the SC found no sufficient proof to support these allegations. *Mendoza v. People, G.R. No. 173551, 4 October 2007, 534 SCRA 668, 700* reiterates that bias cannot be presumed.
*   **Medical Evidence:** The defense argued that the medico-legal findings, particularly regarding the vaginal orifice, were inconsistent with rape. *People v. Orita, G.R. No. 88724, 3 April 1990, 184 SCRA 105, 114* states full penetration of the vagina is not essential; any penetration is sufficient.
*   **Defense of Alibi:** Both appellants presented alibis. However, these were undermined by the fact that they were at or near the crime scene during the incident, which is fatal to the defense's claim based on *People v. Aguila, G.R. No. 171017, 6 December 2006, 510 SCRA 642, 661-662.*

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 8353:** Rape. *Catiis v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 153979, 9 February 2006, 482 SCRA 71, 84* states that aggraviating/qualifying circumstances be expressly and specifically alleged in the information, otherwise they cannot be appreciated, even if they are subsequently proved during the trial.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** None are evident, but the date discrepancy and the absence of a conspiracy finding despite being alleged in the information are potential areas for further legal argumentation.

**Overall Assessment:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction based on the victim's credible testimony and positive identification of the appellants. The SC minimized potential issues like the date discrepancy and medical evidence. The remaining avenue for appeal is limited given the facts of this case.
