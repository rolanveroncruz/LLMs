**Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 223582 & G.R. No. 223788 (Consolidated)**

**Case:** *Ricardo D. Angeles vs. St. Catherine Realty Corporation, et al.* and *St. Catherine Realty Corporation, et al. vs. Ricardo D. Angeles and Francisco Pacheco, Jr.*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, First Division

**Date:** August 7, 2024

**Key Issue:** Legality of termination of Ricardo D. Angeles (Surveyor/Purchaser) and Francisco Pacheco, Jr. (Landscaper) by St. Catherine Realty Corporation on the ground of loss of trust and confidence.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *GRANTED* Angeles's Petition (G.R. No. 223582) and *DENIED* St. Catherine's Petition (G.R. No. 223788), effectively ruling that both Angeles and Pacheco were illegally dismissed.

**Key Provisions & Rationale:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal (Art. 297(c) Labor Code):** The Court reiterated that fraud or willful breach of trust is a just cause for termination, but requires substantial evidence and must be based on intentional acts, not mere carelessness (*Coca-Cola Femsa Philippines, Inc. v. Alpuerto, 872 Phil. 282 (2020)*). The employer bears the *onus probandi* to prove valid cause (*Ginta-Ason v. J.T.A. Packaging Corp., G.R. No. 244206, March 16, 2022*).

*   **Loss of Trust and Confidence:**
    *   **Requisites:** Valid dismissal requires the employee holding a position of trust and sufficient establishment of an act justifying loss of trust and confidence (*Colegio San Agustin-Bacolod v. Montaño, G.R. No. 212333, March 28, 2022*). The breach must be substantial. (*Systems and Plan Integrator and Development Corp. v. Ballesteros, G.R. No. 217119, April 25, 2022*)
    *   **Managerial vs. Rank-and-File:** Proof of involvement is required for rank-and-file employees (*East Asia Utilities Corp. v. Arenas, G.R. No. 211443, December 1, 2021*).  The level of scrutiny is different.
    *   **Fiduciary Rank-and-File:** Involves employees who regularly handle significant amounts of money or property (*Jalit, Sr. v. Cargo Safeway, Inc., G.R. No. 238147, September 29, 2021*).

*   **Angeles's Case:**
    *   The Court found no substantial evidence that Angeles, as Surveyor/Purchaser, regularly handled significant amounts of money or property to qualify as a fiduciary rank-and-file employee.
    *   Even assuming such a position, St. Catherine et al. failed to prove a *willful* and *deliberate* act of misleading in the discrepancy of prices between sales invoices. The employer's evidence was insufficient to prove connivance or misappropriation. The burden of proof rests on the employer, not on the employee to disprove the employer’s claim. (*Philippine Savings Bank v. Genove, 874 Phil. 1, 17 (2020)*).

*   **Pacheco's Case:**
    *   The Court affirmed the CA's ruling that Pacheco, as Landscaper, did not occupy a position of trust and confidence.  His duties were manual and did not entail routine handling of significant amounts of money or property (*Pacific Royal Basic Foods, Inc. v. Noche, G.R. No. 202392, October 4, 2021*).

**Remedies:**

*   **Reinstatement is no longer viable:** Due to the lapse of time, reinstatement is deemed unviable and in its place, the court granted Separation pay to Angeles and Pacheco one month for every year of service.
*   **Backwages:** Full backwages, including allowances and other benefits from the time of illegal dismissal until finality of the Decision.
*   **Interest:** 12% interest *per annum* on backwages from the time withheld until June 30, 2013, then 6% *per annum* from July 1, 2013, until finality. All monetary awards earn 6% *per annum* from finality until fully paid.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 297(c) of the Labor Code (formerly Article 282(c))

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Computation of Backwages and Separation Pay:** Requires remand to the arbitration branch for specific calculations, which may lead to further disputes and appeals.

*   **Definition of "Willful Breach":** The court reiterates the need for a "willful" breach, which is intentionally and knowingly committed without a justifiable excuse. However, determining whether a particular act meets this standard is highly fact-specific and may be subject to varying interpretations.

*   **Fiduciary Role:** The court emphasized that there was no proof that the employees occupied the position of trust. The absence of an employee's fiduciary duty leads to an invalid dismissal.
