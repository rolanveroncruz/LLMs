## Legal Document Summary: Tera単a vs. De Sagun

**Case:** Floraida Tera単a vs. Hon. Antonio De Sagun and Antonio B. Simuangco (G.R. No. 152131)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Subject Matter:** Unlawful Detainer; Interpretation and Application of the Revised Rules of Summary Procedure (RSP).

**Facts:** Respondent (Simuangco) leased property to Petitioner (Tera単a). Petitioner demolished the existing structure and built a new one without Respondent's alleged consent, violating a lease provision prohibiting alterations without consent. Respondent filed an unlawful detainer action. The MTC ruled in favor of the Respondent, ordering Petitioner to vacate the premises.  Petitioner's submission of a position paper and affidavits was late and denied. The RTC affirmed initially, then reversed and remanded to the MTC for further proceedings, allowing Respondent to file a position paper and affidavits.  The CA affirmed the RTC's remand order.

**Key Provisions/Clauses:**

*   **Lease Agreement:**
    *   Paragraph 3(d):  Prohibits alterations without the Lessor's (Respondent) knowledge and consent. This is the core provision at issue.
*   **Civil Code Article 1673(3):** Allows lease termination for violation of any terms/conditions.
*   **Revised Rules of Summary Procedure (RSP):** Governs procedure in unlawful detainer cases. Specifically cited:
    *   Prohibition of motions for extension of time to file pleadings.
    *   Section 10: Rendition of judgment within 30 days after receipt of the last affidavits and position papers, or the expiration of the period for filing the same.
*   **Rules of Court:**
    * Rule 8, Section 10 and 11 on Denial of allegations in pleadings.
    *   Rule 70, Section 17 limits recoverable damages to unpaid rent.
    *   Rule 2, Section 5 prohibits joinder of special civil actions or actions governed by special rules

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner (Lessee):** Obligated to maintain the property per the lease agreement and to refrain from alterations without consent.
*   **Respondent (Lessor):** Implicitly, to allow peaceful possession if the lease terms are met.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner:**  Found liable for violating the lease agreement, resulting in an order to vacate the premises. Initially, the MTC ordered payment of attorney's fees, though this was not upheld.
*   **Respondent:**  Potentially liable for reimbursement of construction costs if consent had been proven. However, this claim was not upheld.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguous Consent:** The central point of contention - the validity of consent.  Petitioner failed to specifically plead and prove consent to the demolition and reconstruction. The risk of misinterpretation of facts.
*   **Strict Application of RSP:** The court's strict interpretation of the RSP regarding extensions and late filings is crucial. The petitioner was prejudiced by her failure to comply with the strict deadlines.
*   **Damages Limitation:** Parties sought damages beyond what is permissible in an unlawful detainer action. Claims for reimbursement of construction costs or moral damages are unlikely to succeed in such a case.
* The Court ruled that a general denial is less credible than an affirmative assertion.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Tera単a v. De Sagun (G.R. No. 152131):** The present case.
*   **Don Tino Realty Development Corporation v. Florentino (G.R. No. 134222):** Illustrates the strict application of the RSP.
*   **Pasricha v. Don Luis Dison Realty, Inc. (G.R. No. 136409):** Reiterates the elements of unlawful detainer.
*   **Araos v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 107057):** Clarifies the limited scope of damages recoverable in unlawful detainer actions.
*   **Ramos v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 119872):** Cites Article 1673(3) as basis for the MTC's decision.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The "Consent" Clause:** The vagueness of the consent clause is key.  The written lease does not specify *how* consent must be granted (e.g., written, verbal).  The absence of documentation makes the consent issue highly fact-dependent and susceptible to evidentiary challenges.

**Overall Assessment:**

The case revolves around the strict application of the RSP and the interpretation of a consent clause in a lease agreement. The petitioner failed to comply with procedural rules and adequately prove the respondent's consent to the demolition and reconstruction. This resulted in her ejectment from the property. The Supreme Court reversed the lower courts and decided the case on the evidence in the record and ruled against the petitioner.
