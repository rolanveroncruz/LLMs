Okay, here's a summary of the legal document, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Oscar C. Fernandez v. Judge Lilia C. Español*, A.M. No. MTJ-98-1150 (April 15, 1998)

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against a Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) judge for gross ignorance of law, knowingly rendering an unjust interlocutory order (Art. 206, RPC), and violation of §3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Facts:**

*   Complainant (Fernandez) obtained a favorable judgment in an unlawful detainer case. Defendant appealed.
*   Complainant moved for execution due to Defendant’s failure to post a supersedeas bond and pay monthly rentals.
*   Respondent Judge initially granted the motion for execution, but subsequently granted Defendant's motion for reconsideration based on an "Affidavit" from other co-owners allegedly renewing the lease.
*   Complainant alleged that the appellate docket fee was paid late, and that granting the motion for reconsideration was improper under the Rules on Summary Procedure and Rule 70, Sec 8 of the Rules of Court.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Rules on Summary Procedure:** Complainant alleged violation of Section 19 (Prohibited Pleadings and Motions).  The Court clarified that the Rules apply to the main action, not post-judgment incidents.
*   **Execution Pending Appeal in Ejectment Cases (Rule 70, §8; *Centrum Agri-Business Realty Corporation vs. Katalbas-Moscardon*, 247 SCRA 145 (1995)):**  Execution of the judgment in an unlawful detainer is immediately executory, and may be stayed only if the defendant-appellants (1) perfect their appeal, (2) file a supersedeas bond, and (3) periodically deposit the rentals falling due during the pendency of the appeal. The Court noted that the judge should have simply verified compliance with these requirements.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** A motion for reconsideration is a prohibited pleading under the Rules of Summary Procedure.
*   **Supervening Event:** The Judge justified the reconsideration based on a “supervening event” (renewal of lease). The Court found this excuse "flimsy," noting the Complainant's sole authority as administrator of the estate.
*   **Administratorship:** Complainant had been appointed administrator. The Court held that the judge should have recognized only the complainant as administrator.
*    **Good Faith:** The Court noted a lack of evidence indicating malice on the part of the Judge, but found ignorance of the law in the grant of the Motion for Reconsideration.

**Obligations:**

*   Judges have an obligation to know the law, especially regarding ejectment cases, which frequently come before MTCCs.
*   Judges must ensure compliance with Rule 70, §8 for staying execution in ejectment cases.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Judge was found administratively liable for ignorance of the law, but not gross ignorance.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Erroneous application of the Rules on Summary Procedure and Rule 70 can lead to administrative sanctions.
*   Relying on unverified affidavits or overlooking the established authority of an administrator can be problematic.
*   Granting a motion for reconsideration that is a prohibited pleading under the Rules of Summary Procedure.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Centrum Agri-Business Realty Corporation vs. Katalbas-Moscardon*, 247 SCRA 145 (1995) (Requirements to stay execution in ejectment)
*   *Puncia v. Gerona*, 252 SCRA 425, 430 (1996) (Duty to order execution in ejectment)
*   *Roa, Sr. v. Imbing*, 231 SCRA 57, 61 (1994); *Guillermo v. Reyes, Jr.*, 240 SCRA 154, 161 (1995); *Alvarado v. Laquindanum*, 245 SCRA 501, 504 (1995); *Bengzon v. Adaoag*, 250 SCRA 344, 348 (1995) (Standard for imposing drastic disciplinary action for ignorance of law)

**Statutory References:**

*   Art. 206, Revised Penal Code (Knowingly Rendering Unjust Interlocutory Order)
*   §3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act)
*   Rule 70, §8 of the Rules of Court (Execution of ejectment decisions)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The determination of whether the supervening event, as presented by the defendant’s Affidavit, could justify granting the Motion for Reconsideration.
* The application of the Rules on Summary Procedure to incidents occurring subsequent to the main action, which ultimately was found inapplicable in this case.

**Outcome:**

The Court imposed a fine of P2,000.00 on the Respondent Judge, with a warning. This penalty was less severe due to the absence of malice.
