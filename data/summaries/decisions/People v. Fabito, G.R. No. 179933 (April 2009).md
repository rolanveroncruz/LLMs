## Legal Document Summary - People v. Fabito, G.R. No. 179933

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, acquitting Joseph Fabito of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code. The RTC previously convicted Fabito based primarily on the testimony of the victim, AAA, a 14-year-old at the time of the alleged incident.

**Key Provisions/Allegations:**

*   Accusation: Fabito, along with Froilan Paraan and Tony Bauzon, was charged with rape in conspiracy.
*   Victim's Testimony: AAA claimed she was drugged and raped by Fabito while the other two watched.
*   Defense: The accused denied the rape and presented an alibi that AAA was drunk and with them but no rape occurred.
*   Medical Evidence: Examination showed healed hymenal lacerations but couldn't determine if they were from forced or consensual sex. No spermatozoa found.

**Key Issues and Arguments:**

*   **Credibility of the Victim:** The Supreme Court found AAA's testimony unreliable due to inconsistencies between her sworn statement and court testimony, specifically concerning:
    *   The circumstances leading to her feeling dizzy (liquor vs. coke).
    *   Who accompanied her after the alleged rape.
    *   Dropping out of school prior to the incident, conflicting with claims of attending classes that day.
    *   Attending the birthday party of her boyfriend's brother the day after the alleged rape.
*   **Corroboration:** The Court noted the lack of corroborating evidence, particularly the absence of Ardee Bauzon's testimony, who was present during the drinking spree.
*   **Medical Evidence:** While confirming prior sexual activity, the medical report lacked conclusive evidence of forced intercourse during the alleged incident.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code:** The law under which Fabito was charged (Rape).
*   **People v. Cabalquinto, G.R. No. 167693:** This case established the practice of using fictitious initials for victims of sexual assault.
*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. Nos. 147678-87:** This case outlines the procedure for automatic appeal of cases with a penalty of reclusion perpetua.
*   **People v. Muleta, G.R. No. 130189:** This case underscores that accusation is not synonymous with guilt, and that the prosecution has the burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** N/A

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   **Unreliable Testimony:** The Supreme Court emphasized the caution needed when a conviction relies heavily on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim.
*   **Inconsistencies:** Substantial inconsistencies in the victim's statements significantly weakened the prosecution's case.
*   **Conduct After Incident:** The victim's actions following the alleged rape (attending a birthday party at her boyfriends home whom participated in the event) were deemed inconsistent with the behavior expected of a rape victim.
*   **Weak Defense vs Weak Prosecution:** Supreme court stated that the defense was made stronger by the weak case presented by the prosecution.
