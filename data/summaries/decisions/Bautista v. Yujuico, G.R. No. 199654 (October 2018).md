## Legal Document Summary: Bautista v. Yujuico (G.R. No. 199654)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals Decision affirming the RTC's finding of Isidro A. Bautista, a Land Bank branch manager, liable for indirect contempt of court. The contempt citation stemmed from his initial failure to comply with a garnishment order related to just compensation owed to Teresita M. Yujuico in an expropriation case filed by the City of Manila.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Expropriation Case (Civil Case No. 96-79699):** The City of Manila was ordered to pay Teresita M. Yujuico just compensation for the expropriation of her property, totaling Php 73,257,555.00, less prior payments.
*   **Writ of Execution & Garnishment:** A writ of execution was issued, and a notice of garnishment was served on the City of Manila's funds at Land Bank, YMCA Branch, managed by Isidro Bautista.
*   **RTC Order for Release of Funds:** The RTC directed the release of Php 31,039,881.00 from the City School Board (CSB) funds deposited with Land Bank.
*   **Mandamus Petition (Civil Case No. 02-103748):** Teresita filed a petition for mandamus to compel the CSB to pass a resolution appropriating funds for the remaining balance of the just compensation.
*   **CSB Resolution No. 700 (2007):** The CSB resolved to pay Php37,809,345.47 to Teresita.
*   **Indirect Contempt Petition:** Teresita filed a petition for indirect contempt against Isidro for failing to comply with the court's orders to release the garnished funds.
*   **RTC Decision on Contempt:** The RTC found Isidro guilty of indirect contempt and ordered him to pay a fine of Php 30,000.00 and attorney's fees of Php 30,000.00.
*   **CA Decision on Contempt:** The CA affirmed the RTC's decision.

**Key Liabilities:**

*   **City of Manila:** Primary obligor to pay just compensation to Teresita M. Yujuico.
*   **Isidro Bautista (Initially):** Held liable for indirect contempt by the RTC and CA for his initial failure to comply with the garnishment order. (The Supreme Court overturned this)

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Exemption of Public Funds:** The City of Manila, through its legal officers, argued that its funds (specifically the Special Education Fund) were exempt from garnishment as public funds. This point was key to Isidro's defense.
*   **Conflict Between Bank's Duty and Court Order:** Isidro faced a conflict between his fiduciary duty to the City of Manila as a bank manager and his obligation to comply with the court's garnishment order.
*   **"Mootness" Argument:** Isidro argued that the petition for indirect contempt was rendered moot by his subsequent compliance with the order (after receiving authorization), but the lower courts rejected this argument.
*   **Interpretation of "Willful Disobedience":** The central issue was whether Isidro's initial non-compliance constituted "willful disobedience" or a justified action based on bank policy and legal advice.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 71, Sections 3(b) and (d) of the Rules of Court:** Basis for the indirect contempt charge (disobedience of or resistance to a lawful writ, process, order, or judgment of a court; unlawful interference with the process or proceedings of a court).
*   **Rule 39, Sections 36-38 of the Rules of Court:** Regarding the Examination of the debtors
*   **Rule 39, Section 40 of the Rules of Court:** Regarding the execution of judgments
*   **Eminent Domain & Just Compensation:** The Supreme Court emphasizes the importance of prompt and judicious payment of just compensation in expropriation proceedings.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversing the CA decision and directing the RTC to dismiss the petition for indirect contempt. The Court found that Isidro Bautista's actions were not contumacious. He acted prudently and in good faith, guided by bank policy, the advice of the Land Bank Litigation Department, and instructions from the City of Manila. He did not exhibit a willful disregard for the court's authority. Further, there was no deliberate or unjustified refusal on his part to comply with the trial court's directive to release the amount in Teresita's favor. The court also noted the government's need to ensure the prompt payment of just compensation in expropriation cases.

**Legal Considerations:**

The Supreme Court decision highlights the balancing act required of bank managers when faced with conflicting duties. It emphasizes the importance of establishing a lack of *willfulness* in disobedience for a finding of indirect contempt. Furthermore, the case serves as a reminder of the government's obligation to promptly pay just compensation in expropriation cases.
