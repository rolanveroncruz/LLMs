## Legal Document Summary - *Suarez, Jr. v. National Steel Corporation* (G.R. No. 150180, October 17, 2008)

**Core Issue:** Whether retrenched employees of National Steel Corporation (NSC) who received separation pay are entitled to additional retirement benefits under the CBA and retirement plan.

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, denying the petitioners' claim for retirement benefits. The SC ruled that the explicit terms of NSC's retirement plan and the CBA exclude retrenched employees from entitlement to both separation pay and retirement benefits.

**Key Provisions and Analysis:**

*   **Retirement Plan (Article X(E)):**  Expressly prohibits the recovery of retirement benefits in cases of "terminations for cause," including retrenchment (an "authorized cause" under Art. 283 of the Labor Code). The SC rejected the argument that "terminations for cause" only covers "just cause" dismissals.

*   **CBA (Article XIV):** The 1994-1996 CBA, specifically Section 3, states that laid-off employees pursuant to a retrenchment program shall be given two (2) months base pay per year of service. This section is a direct replacement of a previous section that granted retrenched employees the same benefits as retirees. This change was interpreted by the SC as a trade-off, increasing retrenchment compensation in lieu of normal retirement benefits.

*   **Quitclaims:**  Petitioners executed releases and quitclaims after receiving their separation packages.  The SC upheld the validity of these quitclaims, finding no evidence of coercion or undue influence, and noting the quitclaims were written in both English and Visayan. Reference to *Periquet v. NLRC* on the validity of quitclaims is pertinent.

*   **Parol Evidence Rule:** Petitioners argued the CA erred in relying on affidavits from union and management officials to interpret the CBA. The SC held the affidavits were admissible as evidence of the parties' *contemporaneous and subsequent acts* (Art. 1371 of the Civil Code) to clarify an intrinsic ambiguity in the CBA, especially regarding intent related to the retirement provisions. The affidavits confirm that payment of the separation package for retrenched employees was intended to be *exclusive* of retirement benefits.

**Obligations:**

*   **NSC:**  Obligated to provide separation pay to retrenched employees per Article 283 of the Labor Code.
*   **Petitioners:** Bound by the signed quitclaims.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Found liable for no claims against NSC.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Terminations for Cause":** While the SC clarified the term to encompass authorized causes, future disputes might arise if the retirement plan's language remains unclear.
*   **Reliance on Affidavits:** While the SC upheld the use of affidavits here, relying heavily on parol evidence can be risky if the written agreement is facially unambiguous. The CA's potential reliance on affidavits could be seen as a contentious point, but was not problematic in this case.
*   **Union Representation:** Concerns of bad faith on the part of the Union officers who signed the affidavits were raised, but not substantiated.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 282, 283, 284 of the Labor Code:** Regarding just and authorized causes for termination.
*   **Article 1371 of the Civil Code:** Pertaining to interpretation of contracts based on contemporaneous and subsequent acts.
*   **Section 9, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court:** Parol Evidence Rule.

**Case Law:**

*   **Periquet v. National Labor Relations Commission:** Cited for the principle that quitclaims are valid if voluntarily entered into and represent a reasonable settlement.
*   **Aquino v. NLRC, University of the East v. Minister of Labor, and Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus Co. v. Court of Appeals:** Distinguished by the SC because in those cases, there was no specific prohibition in the retirement plan or CBA against receiving both separation pay and retirement benefits.
*   **DBP vs CA:** Forum shopping
**Conclusion:**

The SC emphasized the importance of clear and unambiguous language in CBAs and retirement plans. The ruling confirms that employers can exclude retrenched employees from retirement benefits if the relevant agreements clearly state this intention. The reliance on both the retirement plan's "terminations for cause" provision, the altered CBA language, and the parol evidence provided by the affidavits demonstrates a comprehensive approach to interpreting the intent of the parties.
