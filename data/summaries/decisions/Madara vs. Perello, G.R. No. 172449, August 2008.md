## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 172449

**Case:** _Lazaro Madara, et al. vs. Hon. Norma C. Perello, et al._

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Date:** August 20, 2008

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding an intra-corporate dispute and associated enforcement actions.

**Key Provisions:**

*   The case stems from two consolidated amended complaints filed in the name of Provident International Resources Corporation (PIRC) (the "Plaintiff PIRC") against PAGCOR and certain individuals (Civil Cases No. 02-228 and 02-238) regarding control of PIRC and lease rentals from PAGCOR. The Plaintiffs are claiming to be the true directors and officers.
*   The real PIRC (Intervenors/Defendants) filed an Answer in Intervention, asserting that the individual petitioners (Madara, Roa, Venus) misrepresented themselves and are not the legitimate directors and officers.
*   The RTC ruled in favor of the real PIRC, declaring them to be the duly constituted board of directors and officers.
*   The RTC ordered the petitioners to return the lease payments received from PAGCOR and to pay substantial damages (P5,000,000) and attorney's fees (P500,000) to the real PIRC.
*   The petitioners filed various actions, including a Notice of Appeal (later withdrawn), a Petition for Review (also withdrawn), a Petition for Relief from Judgment, and multiple Petitions for Certiorari (CA-G.R. SP No. 90821 and CA-G.R. SP No. 91950).
*   The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for certiorari in CA-G.R. SP No. 90821, finding the petitioners guilty of forum shopping and that they were parties to the original consolidated civil cases and thus personally liable.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (Madara, Roa, Venus):** Joint and several liability to return lease payments and pay damages and attorney's fees to the real PIRC, as ordered by the RTC.  Liable for costs in the Supreme Court.
*   **PAGCOR:** Potential obligation to remit lease payments to the real PIRC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Forum Shopping:** The Supreme Court affirms the CA's finding of forum shopping, potentially leading to sanctions against the petitioners.
*   **Personal Liability:** The core risk is the enforcement of the RTC judgment against the petitioners personally. The SC upheld the imposition of personal liability based on the petitioners' misrepresentation as officers of PIRC, and active prosecution of the suits.
*   **Enforcement of RTC Decision:**  The dismissal of the petition clears the way for the full enforcement of the RTC decision, including the seizure of the petitioners' assets.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Revised Rules of Court:** Governs Petitions for Review on Certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Rule 65, Revised Rules of Court:** Governs Petitions for Certiorari.
*   **Rule 7, Section 5, Revised Rules of Court:**  Prohibition against forum shopping. Provides grounds for summary dismissal for violation of the rule against forum shopping.
*   **_Spouses Julita dela Cruz v. Pedro Joaquin, G.R. No. 162788, July 28, 2005, 464 SCRA 576_:** Defines forum shopping.
*   **_Top Rate Construction & General Services, Inc. v. Paxton Development Corporation, G.R. No. 151081, September 11, 2003, 410 SCRA 604_:**  Illustrates the dangers of conflicting decisions arising from forum shopping.
*   **_Young v. Seng, G.R. No. 143464, March 5, 2003, 398 SCRA 629_:**  Sets out the test for determining forum shopping based on litis pendentia and res judicata.
*   **_Municipality of Taguig v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 142619, September 13, 2005, 469 SCRA 580_:** Addresses the issue of willful and deliberate violation of the rule against forum shopping.
*   **_Provident International Resources Corporation v. Venus (G.R. No. 167041) promulgated last June 17, 2008_:**  Related case validating the real PIRC's stock and transfer book.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Party Status:**  The central issue revolves around whether the petitioners were truly parties to the original consolidated cases, despite not being explicitly named as plaintiffs or defendants. The Court relies heavily on their actions and representations to conclude they voluntarily submitted to the court's jurisdiction.
*   **Due Process:**  Petitioners allege denial of due process due to lack of notice and opportunity to be heard. The Court rejects this claim, finding that they effectively participated in the cases through the PIRC.
*   **Basis of Personal Liability:** The court imposed personal liability due to misrepresentation. A potentially contentious aspect is how far this principle can be extended to corporate officers acting in the name of the corporation.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, primarily due to forum shopping. The decision upholds the validity of the RTC decision, thereby affirming the real PIRC as the legitimate governing body and imposing significant financial liability on the individual petitioners. The key risk for the petitioners is the immediate enforcement of the RTC judgment. The case also serves as a strong reminder of the severe consequences of forum shopping and misrepresentation.
