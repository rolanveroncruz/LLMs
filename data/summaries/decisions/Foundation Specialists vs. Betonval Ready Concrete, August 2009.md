**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision regarding a sum of money claim arising from breach of contract.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Contracts:** Three contracts for ready-mixed concrete delivery from Betonval to FSI.
    *   FSI supplies cement.
    *   Payment within 7 days of invoice presentation.
    *   30% p.a. interest on overdue payments.
    *   Credit limit of P600,000.
*   **Breach:** FSI failed to pay outstanding balances.
*   **Extension:** Betonval extended the payment term to 45 days.
*   **Interest Rate:** Initially 30% p.a., later reduced to 24% p.a. through FSI's proposed payment schedule and subsequent payments reflecting this lower rate.
*   **Preliminary Attachment:** Betonval obtained a writ of preliminary attachment alleging fraud.
*   **Damages:** RTC initially awarded FSI compensatory damages for improper attachment, later increased by the RTC.
*   **CA Decision:** Modified the RTC decision, increasing interest on Betonval's award to 24% p.a. plus 12% legal interest from finality and reducing FSI's compensatory damages to P200,000.
*   **Current Petition:** FSI seeks: (a) lower interest rate on Betonval's award, (b) deduction for unused cement, (c) increased damages for wrongful attachment, (d) joint and several liability of Betonval and Stronghold for damages, and (e) Betonval's liability for Stronghold's liability under the attachment bond.

**Obligations:**

*   FSI: To pay Betonval for delivered ready-mixed concrete, including interest at 24% p.a., with 12% legal interest from the finality of judgment until full payment.
*   Betonval: To deliver ready-mixed concrete according to contract terms.
*   Stronghold: Jointly and severally liable with Betonval under the attachment bond to the extent of coverage for actual damages suffered by FSI due to wrongful attachment.

**Liabilities:**

*   FSI: Liable to Betonval for P1,114,203.34 plus 24% p.a. interest, with 12% legal interest from finality.
*   Betonval: Liable for damages arising from improper attachment, limited to coverage by the attachment bond in conjunction with Stronghold.
*   Stronghold: Jointly and severally liable up to the amount of the attachment bond for damages resulting from the improper attachment.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interest Rate:** FSI's arguments regarding novation and waiver of the 30% interest rate, as well as arguments that a lower or no interest rate should be applied, have been rejected by the lower court.
*   **Unused Cement:** FSI's claim for a deduction for unused cement is deemed waived as it was not raised as an affirmative defense and not part of the dispositve portion of the judgement.
*   **Wrongful Attachment:** While FSI was awarded damages for wrongful attachment, these were reduced on appeal, and its attempt to increase them is unlikely to succeed as it failed to appeal.
*   **Improper Attachment:** The application for the writ of preliminary attachment was based on Section 1(d) and (e), Rule 57 of the Rules of Court.
    *   It may not be able to successfully prove Betonval was guilty of fraud in contracting the debt.
    *   It may not be able to prove Betonval removed or disposed of property to defraud his creditors.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles regarding novation (Art. 1231), waiver, and contract interpretation.
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 9, Sec. 1 (Waiver of Defenses); Rule 57, Sec. 1 (Grounds for Attachment); Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. CA (interest on judgments).
*   **Ng Wee v. Tankiansee:** Fraudulent intent must be proven, not merely inferred from nonpayment.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The exact terms of the extended payment period (45 days) and its impact on the original interest provision were at the center of the dispute, particularly whether the extension constituted a novation or waiver. The court found the agreement to be a modification of the existing agreement as opposed to a full novation.

**Overall Summary:**

The Supreme Court ultimately denied FSI's petition. This case hinges on a breach of contract for the delivery of ready-mixed concrete. Key issues include the applicable interest rate, the proper attachment of FSI's properties, and the extent of damages recoverable by FSI for wrongful attachment. The Court upheld the CA decision, finding FSI liable for the unpaid balance plus 24% interest, and awarded only limited damages for the improper attachment. FSI's main arguments for appeal were that Betonval did not meet its burden of proof, that FSI's actions warranted damages, that Betonval's application for the writ of preliminary attachment was improper, and that the terms of the contract had been novated. The Court found Betonval met its burden of proof, that the application of the writ of preliminary attachment was proper, and that there was no novation.
