**Case Summary: Hernandez v. Magsaysay Maritime Corporation (G.R. No. 226103)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA decision that reversed the NLRC's grant of permanent total disability benefits to the petitioner, a seafarer.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **POEA-SEC (Philippine Overseas Employment Administration â€“ Standard Employment Contract):** Dominates the resolution.
*   **Section 20(A)(3) of the 2010 POEA-SEC:** Establishes procedure for resolving conflicting medical assessments: Company-designated physician's assessment vs. Seafarer's physician's assessment requires referral to a third, jointly agreed upon, doctor. The third doctor's decision is final and binding.
*   **Company-Designated Physician's Assessment:** The Court emphasizes that the seafarer has the burden to initiate the third doctor process by signifying his intention to resolve the conflict with the assessment of the company-designated physician.
*   **Section 32 of the POEA-SEC: Compensation System:** A Schedule of Disability or Impediment for Injuries Suffered and Diseases including Occupational Diseases or Illness Contracted, in conjunction with Section 20 (B)(6) which provides that in case of a permanent total or partial disability, the seafarer shall be compensated in accordance with Section 32.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Initial Ruling:** Labor Arbiter initially ruled in favor of permanent total disability benefits (US$60,000), sickness allowance, and attorney's fees.
*   **NLRC Modification:** Upheld permanent total disability but deleted sickness allowance.
*   **CA Decision:** Reduced award to a Disability Grade 11 rating (US$7,465), based on the company-designated physician's assessment, citing failure to follow the third-doctor procedure.
*   **SC Ruling:** Denies the petition, affirming CA decision. The seafarer must return the excess amount already received.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Third-Doctor Referral:** The *mandatory* nature of the third-doctor referral process is the core issue. Failure to comply is *fatal* to a claim for permanent total disability when the company-designated physician has issued a disability grading.
*   **Timeliness:** The company-designated physician must provide a valid and definite assessment within the 120/240-day period.
*   **Fraudulent Misrepresentation:** While initially raised, this was ultimately deemed not applicable in this case. It remains a potential risk in similar claims.
*   **Conditional Satisfaction of Judgement Award:** There exists a great risk to Seafarers accepting this type of payment. The agreement explicitly stated that Hernandez would return the money should the case be overturned.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **POEA-SEC (2010 version specifically cited)**

*   ***Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc., et al., 588 Phil. 895 (2008):*** Underscores that final determination of whose decision must prevail must be done in accordance with an agreed procedure.
*   ***Splash Philippines, Inc., et al. v. Ruizo, 730 Phil. 162 (2014):***  Emphasizes the importance of observing Section 32 and the disability grading system.

*   **Bahia Shipping Services, Inc., et al. v. Constantino, 738 Phil. 564 (2014)**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Areas:**

*   **Interpretation of "Loss of Earning Capacity":** While the LA and NLRC emphasized this concept, the SC ultimately prioritizes the medical grading system and adherence to the POEA-SEC procedure.
*   **Weight Given to Seafarer's Doctor's Opinion:** The Court significantly discounts the seafarer's doctor's assessment because it was based on a single examination and interpretation of existing MRI results, lacking continuous monitoring and treatment.

**Conclusion:**

This case is unfavorable to seafarers seeking permanent total disability benefits. It reinforces the *mandatory* nature of the third-doctor referral process under the POEA-SEC when there's a conflict in medical assessments. Failure to initiate this process is *fatal* to a claim for permanent total disability, even if the seafarer alleges loss of earning capacity.
