Okay, here's a summary of the document, formatted for a lawyer's use:

**Case:** *David H. Carnabuci v. Harryvette Rowena Taga√±a-Carnabuci, et al.*, G.R. No. 266116, July 22, 2024

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming with modification the RTC's denial of a Petition for Habeas Corpus with Child Custody.

**Background:**

*   Italian citizen David (Petitioner) and Harryvette (Respondent) married in the Philippines and have two minor children, Rocco (born 2015) and Zahara (born 2017).
*   The parties separated, alleging abuse.
*   A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) in 2017 addressed custody and support. Key provision: shared custody with father providing support only when children are in his care.
*   Harryvette left for France for work, leaving the children with David, but later disputes arose concerning care and custody.

**Procedural History:**

*   David filed a Petition for Habeas Corpus to gain custody.
*   RTC initially granted provisional custody to the maternal grandmother, Joselyn, with visitation rights for David.
*   RTC then awarded exclusive parental authority, care, and *permanent* custody to Harryvette (when in the Philippines or directly overseas); provisional custody to Joselyn while Harryvette is abroad; and visitation rights to David with ordered child support payments (20,000 php monthly). A hold departure order was issued for the minor children.
*   CA modified the RTC decision, granting *joint parental authority* to both parents but *sole* custody to Harryvette, upholding the provisional custody to Joselyn, and affirming visitation rights and support obligations. The CA struck down the "permanent" part of the RTC ruling.
*   David appealed to the Supreme Court.

**Key Issues & Ruling:**

1.  **Parental Authority and Custody:**
    *   The SC affirmed the CA's decision to grant joint parental authority to both David and Harryvette. Citing Articles 211 and 220 of the Family Code, it stated separation of parents does not divest them of parental authority. Reference is made to A.M. No. 02-11-12-SC regarding provisional custody orders and preferences.
    *   The SC upheld the grant of sole custody to Harryvette, despite her being an OFW, because she actively communicates with and financially supports the children. *Espiritu v. Court of Appeals, 312 Phil. 431 (1995)* is cited to support granting custody to a parent working abroad.
    *   The 'sole' custody granted to Harryvette, however, must not prevent David from exercising his right to visitation under reasonable circumstances, based on the best interests of the children.

2.  **Harryvette's Absence:**
    *   The SC rejected the argument that Harryvette is "absent" under Article 212 of the Family Code. The court held that Harryvette's continued communication, financial support, and visits to the Philippines demonstrate active parental involvement.

3.  **Joselyn's Provisional Authority:**
    *   The SC affirmed the CA's granting of provisional custody to Joselyn while Harryvette is abroad. This aligns with Article 213 of the Family Code and considerations of the children's best interests.

**Relevant Laws & Jurisprudence:**

*   **Family Code:** Articles 211, 212, 213, 214, 220, 228-232 (Suspension/Termination of Parental Authority). Article 213 embodies the "tender-age presumption."
*   **A.M. No. 03-04-04-SC:** (Rule on Custody of Minors and Writ of Habeas Corpus in Relation to Custody of Minors). Sec. 14 lists factors in determining custody.
*   **A.M. No. 02-11-12-SC:** (Proposed Rule on Provisional Orders)
*   **Constitution:** Protection of Children's Welfare
*   **International Law:** United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Articles 3 and 9).
*   **Case Law:** *Sombong v. Court of Appeals, 322 Phil. 737 (1996)* (function of habeas corpus in custody cases); *Santos v. Court of Appeals, 312 Phil. 482 (1995)* (parental authority/custody); *Versoza v. People, 861 Phil. 230 (2019)* (scope of parental authority); *Dacasin v. Dacasin, 625 Phil. 494 (2010)* (joint custody agreements); *Espiritu v. Court of Appeals, 312 Phil. 431 (1995)* (custody to a parent working abroad). *Aquino v. Aquino, G.R. No. 208912 & G.R. No. 209018, December 7, 2021* (custody of nonmarital children)

**Key Provisions:**

*   Grant of *joint parental authority* to both parents.
*   Grant of *sole custody* to Harryvette, but this is not absolute, as it is subject to change based on the best interests of the children.
*   Provisional custody to Joselyn while Harryvette is outside the Philippines.
*   Visitation rights for David, including specific conditions.
*   David's obligation to provide monthly support of PHP 20,000.00.
*   Hold Departure Order in place until the children reach seven years of age (now moot since both children are older than 7).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Enforcement of Visitation Rights:** Difficulty in enforcing visitation rights, especially considering the geographical distance and the need for coordination.
*   **Definition of "Best Interests":** The application of the "best interests of the child" standard remains subjective and can lead to future disputes.
*   **Future Relocation:** Potential future relocation of the children by Harryvette, especially if she establishes permanent residency abroad, might require further court intervention.
*   **"Sole" Custody Ambiguity:** The use of "sole custody" with simultaneously granting visitation rights is internally inconsistent, as articulated in the Separate Concurring Opinion of Justice Leonen, and may be subject to further judicial interpretation.

**Conclusion:**

The SC affirmed the appellate court's decision, prioritizing the children's best interests. The Court attempted to balance the rights of both parents, recognizing Harryvette's role as the primary caretaker while preserving David's parental authority and visitation rights. Despite the resolution of the legal issues, future conflicts regarding custody and the children's welfare remain possible. The hold departure order for the minor children is likely not enforceable anymore as of today.
