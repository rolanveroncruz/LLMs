## Legal Document Summary: *Avail John Domingo y Linatoc v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 269240, June 05, 2024)

**Nature:** Resolution denying Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration of a prior denial of a Petition for Review on Certiorari, thereby affirming the Court of Appeals' decision which upheld the trial court's conviction of the Petitioner for violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act).

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Affirmation of Factual Findings:** The Supreme Court affirms the consistent factual findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals regarding the credibility of the complainant (AAA) and her father (BBB), reiterating that the alleged inconsistencies in their testimonies were minor and did not negate the Petitioner's liability.
*   **Violation of R.A. 7610, Section 5(b):** The prosecution established all elements of the offense beyond reasonable doubt. The petitioner convinced the 12-year-old complainant that they were married in the eyes of God and then sexually abused her.
*   **Denial of Reconsideration:** The Court found no new or substantial issues raised in the Motion for Reconsideration that would warrant a reversal of its previous denial of the petition.
*   **Increased Penalties:** In addition to the previous judgment, the court imposed a fine of PHP 15,000.00 on Petitioner, referencing *People v. Trocio* (G.R. No. 252791, August 23, 2022).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Petitioner is guilty of violating Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610.
*   **Penalty:** Indeterminate sentence of eight years and eight months of *prision mayor* as minimum, to 18 years of *reclusion temporal* as maximum.
*   **Monetary Damages:** The court ordered the petitioner to pay:
    *   PHP 50,000.00 as civil indemnity
    *   PHP 50,000.00 as moral damages
    *   PHP 50,000.00 as exemplary damages
    *   PHP 15,000.00 as fine
    *   All monetary awards shall earn 6% legal interest per annum.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **No significant ambiguities present.** The decision is a straightforward affirmation of prior decisions.
*   **Case Law:** *People v. Trocio* (G.R. No. 252791, August 23, 2022) is cited as the basis for imposing the fine.
*   **Statutory References:** The primary statutory reference is Republic Act No. 7610, Section 5(b).
*   **Jurisdictional Risk:** The court specifically stated that they found no substantial, special or important reason to warrant the exercise of their discretionary power to review the challenged decision and resolution.

**Analysis for Legal Strategy:**

Given the Supreme Court's denial of the Motion for Reconsideration, the Petitioner has exhausted his direct appeal remedies within the Philippine judicial system. Further appeals would likely require extraordinary circumstances demonstrating grave abuse of discretion or violation of constitutional rights. The focus should now shift to assessing any potential collateral remedies, such as a petition for clemency or pardon, based on humanitarian grounds or changes in circumstances.
