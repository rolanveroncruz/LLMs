## Legal Document Summary: People v. Dela Paz, Jr. (G.R. No. 118316)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming a lower court conviction for rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   Accused-Appellant Antonio dela Paz, Jr. was charged with rape of Merlinda Desacula, a 12-year-old, mentally retarded girl.
*   Eyewitness testimony of Anecito Tabor, victim's brother-in-law, established that he caught the accused *in flagrante delicto* during the sexual act.
*   Medical examination showed old/healed lacerations of hymen but no recent sperm.
*   Victim, due to severe mental retardation, was deemed incompetent to testify.
*   Defense presented alibi and denial.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Accused found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape.
*   Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Ordered to indemnify the victim and her parents P50,000 for moral damages.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Mental Capacity of Victim:** The core issue is whether the victim's mental retardation rendered her unable to consent to sexual activity, establishing the "against her will" element of rape. *People v. Ngo, 202 SCRA 549 (1991)* related to a past laceration on the victim, further establishing the inability to consent.
*   **Lack of Fresh Physical Evidence:** While the court acknowledges the absence of fresh lacerations and sperm is not determinative, the defense contested the conviction based on this lack of corroborating evidence.
*   **Credibility of Eyewitness:** The defense challenged the credibility of the sole eyewitness, Anecito Tabor, alleging inconsistencies and lack of corroboration.
*   **Defense of Alibi:** Accused-appellant alleged he was at a billiard hall and store at the time of the incident, and was later beaten by Tabor, but this was discredited by the lower court.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rape Laws:** Relevant provisions of the Revised Penal Code concerning rape, particularly concerning victims incapable of giving consent due to mental incapacity.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Established jurisprudence holding that trial court's assessment of witness credibility is given great weight unless tainted with arbitrariness *[People v. Dones, 254 SCRA 696 (1996); People v. Sabellina, 238 SCRA 492 (1994)].*
*   **Sufficiency of Single Witness:** *[People v. Robert Daraman, G.R. No. 126046, August 7, 1998; People v. Fulinara, 247 SCRA 28 (1995); People v. Nulla, 153 SCRA 471 (1987)].*
*   **Penetration as Element of Rape:** Case law establishing that penetration, however slight, is sufficient to constitute rape; ejaculation is not required. *[People v. Magana, 259 SCRA 380 (1996); People v. Gabris, 258 SCRA 663 (1996); People v. Ca√±ada, 253 SCRA 277 (1996)].*

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Antonio dela Paz, Jr. for rape based on the eyewitness testimony of Anecito Tabor, despite the victim's inability to testify due to severe mental retardation and the absence of fresh physical evidence of rape. The Court emphasized the trial court's assessment of witness credibility and held that penetration, not ejaculation, is the essential element of rape. The Court dismissed the accused's defense of alibi and rejected arguments challenging the credibility of the eyewitness.
