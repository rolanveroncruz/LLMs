Here's a legal summary of the document:

**Case:** *Atty. Ernesto A. Tabujara III and Christine S. Dayrit vs. People of the Philippines and Daisy Afable*, G.R. No. 175162, October 29, 2008.

**Nature:** Petition assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision which affirmed the Municipal Trial Court's (MTC) order to proceed with the trial of petitioners for Grave Coercion (Art. 286 RPC) and Trespass to Dwelling (Art. 280 RPC).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Criminal Complaints:** Private respondent Afable filed criminal complaints against petitioners for Grave Coercion and Trespass to Dwelling, alleging they forced her to go with them and entered her house against her will.
*   **Petitioners' Defense:** Petitioners claimed they were investigating Afable (a former employee of Miladay Jewels) regarding missing jewelry, and she had been administratively suspended. Afable filed the charges as leverage to compel petitioners to withdraw the estafa case.
*   **MTC's Initial Dismissal:** The MTC initially dismissed the complaints for lack of probable cause, viewing them as leverage against an estafa case filed against Afable by Miladay Jewels (where Atty. Tabujara was legal counsel and Dayrit an officer).
*   **MTC's Reversal:** The MTC reversed its decision upon reconsideration, finding probable cause based on a sworn statement by witness Mauro V. de Lara, alleging that he saw the private complainant being forcibly taken by three persons, referring very apparently to the accused herein, from her residence is already sufficient to establish a prima facie evidence or probable cause against the herein accused for the crimes being imputed against them.
*   **RTC's Decision:** The Regional Trial Court (RTC) denied petitioners' petition for certiorari, upholding the MTC's finding of probable cause. The RTC ruled that the MTC's clarification hearings cured any defect in the initial finding of probable cause.
*   **CA's Decision:** The CA denied petitioners' petition for review, holding they used the wrong mode of appeal.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA decision, finding that the MTC committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the arrest warrants.

**Key Legal Issues and Analysis:**

1.  **Probable Cause Determination:** The central issue is whether the MTC properly determined probable cause for the issuance of arrest warrants. Section 2, Article III of the 1987 Constitution mandates the finding of probable cause must be *personally* determined by the judge *after* examining under oath the complainant and witnesses. The requirements of Section 6 and 9, Rule 112 of Rules of Court are relevant.
    *   **Violation of Procedure:**  The SC found that the MTC relied solely on Mauro De Lara's statement without personally examining him under oath or propounding searching questions, which violates the constitutional requirement. The SC cited *Sangguniang Bayan of Batac v. Judge Albano* to support its claim. The De Lara's affidavit cannot be relied upon by the court *a quo* for its finding of probable cause.
2.  **Due Process:** The lack of proper examination of the witness, as well as the fact that Deprivation of a citizen's liberty through the coercive process of a warrant of arrest is not a matter which courts should deal with casually. This violates petitioners' right to due process and protection against unreasonable seizure.
3.  **Validity of MTC Order:** Since the court a quo's 18 September 2000 Order was issued during the effectivity of the temporary restraining order, the same is considered of no effect.

**Potential Risks and Concerns:**

*   **Incorrect Dismissal:** The CA's ruling was reversed.
*   **Violation of Constitutional Rights:** The issuance of arrest warrants without proper probable cause determination exposes the issuing judge to administrative liability and violates the petitioners' constitutional rights.
*   **Irregularity of the Warrants of Arrest:** Warrants of arrest were precipitously issued against petitioners. Deprivation of a citizen's liberty through the coercive process of a warrant of arrest is not a matter which courts should deal with casually.
    *   *Bagunas v. Judge Fabillar* was cited. Warrants should only be issued if necessary to prevent frustrating the ends of justice, which was not present in this case.

**Outcome:**

The SC *granted* the petition, *reversed* the CA decision, *set aside* the MTC's orders, and *directed* the MTC to dismiss the criminal cases for lack of probable cause and to quash the warrants of arrest.
