**Legal Document Summary: People v. Manaligod (G.R. No. 218584)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for statutory rape under Art. 266-A (D) in relation to Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Statutory Rape Definition:** Defines statutory rape as sexual intercourse with a woman under 12 years of age, regardless of consent.
*   **Elements of Statutory Rape:** (a) age of complainant (under 12); (b) identity of the accused; and (c) sexual intercourse.
*   **Medical Examination:** Reinforces the doctrine that a medical examination is not essential for proving rape; the victim's credible testimony is sufficient.
*   **Defense Argument:**  Addresses and rejects arguments regarding inconsistencies in testimonies about time and the significance of the medical report.
*   **Non-Flight Argument:**  Clarifies that remaining at the scene of the crime does not prove innocence.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-Appellant is obligated to serve a sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused-Appellant is obligated to pay the victim damages as specified.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for statutory rape.
*   Civil liability for damages: P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, all payable to the victim.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   No significant contentious clauses are apparent. The Court relies heavily on settled jurisprudence regarding the elements and proof of rape.
*   **Defense Strategy Failure:**  The defense's decision not to present evidence significantly weakened their case.
*   **Credibility Determination:**  The case hinged on the trial court's assessment of the victim's credibility, which was upheld by the CA and the Supreme Court. A different credibility finding at the trial level could have altered the outcome.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Garcia* (695 Phil. 576, 588 (2012)): Cites the weight of assessing witness' credibility.
