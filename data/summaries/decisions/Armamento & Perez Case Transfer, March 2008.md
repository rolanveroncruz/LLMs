**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 07-11-592-RTC (Re: Transfer of Hearing)**

**Case:** *In Re: Transfer of Hearing of A.M. No. 07-11-592-RTC Criminal Case Nos. 13308 (PP v. Crisostomo Armamento) and 13337 (PP. v. Mark Antony Perez) from RTC - Br. 4, Batangas City to the Bureau of Corrections, Muntinlupa City*

**Nature:** Resolution on an administrative matter concerning the proper venue for trial in two criminal cases where the accused are incarcerated in the New Bilibid Prison (NBP), Muntinlupa City.

**Key Provisions/Holdings:**

*   **Core Principle:** The Judge who hears the case should decide it.  Avoid splitting the hearing and decision-making between judges except when there's no other option.
*   **Rejection of OCA Recommendation:** The Supreme Court rejected the OCA's recommendation to transfer the case records to RTC Muntinlupa City for trial within the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) premises and subsequent return to Batangas City for decision preparation, then back to Muntinlupa for promulgation.
*   **Mandatory Duty to Proceed:** Judge Kalalo of RTC Branch 4, Batangas City, is ordered to conduct the remainder of the trials within the premises of the Bureau of Corrections, Muntinlupa City.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165, Article II, Section 5 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - implicated in Criminal Case No. 13308.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. San Gabriel, 323 Phil. 102, 108 (1996):** Findings of fact of the trial court are accorded greatest respect by the appellate court absent any abuse of discretion.
*   **Dy v. Sacay, G.R. Nos. L-78535-36, September 19, 1988, 165 SCRA 473, 484:** Appellate courts are bound to respect the trial court's findings of facts.
*   **People v. Yadao, G.R. Nos. 72991-92, November 26, 1992, 216 SCRA 1:** Emphasizes the importance of the trial judge's observation of witnesses' demeanor, which is lost when another judge renders the decision.
*   **U.S. v. Abreu, 30 Phil. 402 (1915):**  Distinguished. While *Abreu* allows a successor judge to decide based on existing records when the original judge is unavailable due to death, resignation, etc., it is not applicable here, where the original judge *is* available.

**Obligations:**

*   Judge Albert A. Kalalo (RTC Branch 4, Batangas City) is obligated to conduct the trial proceedings within the Bureau of Corrections, Muntinlupa City.

**Liabilities:**

*   Failure to adhere to the Supreme Court's order could result in administrative sanctions.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Practical Difficulties:**  The order places a burden on Judge Kalalo and his staff to travel and conduct trials in Muntinlupa. Logistical and security concerns associated with conducting trials within a prison facility.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Imposes additional costs on the Batangas City RTC for travel and related expenses.
*   **Due Process concerns if judge can't fairly try the case in the new venue** Could be a cause for appeal if the defense can prove the judge was unable to give the case a fair trial.

**Legal Precision:**

This resolution emphasizes the critical role of the trial judge in assessing witness credibility through direct observation. The court prioritizes the judge's direct exposure to evidence over administrative convenience or cost savings. The *Yadao* case is particularly relevant, highlighting the significance of non-verbal cues in witness testimony, which cannot be captured solely by a transcript.
