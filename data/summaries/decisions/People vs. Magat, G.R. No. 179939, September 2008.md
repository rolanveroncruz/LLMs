**Case Summary: People v. Magat, G.R. No. 179939 (2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a conviction for violation of Sections 5 (sale) and 11 (possession) of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Issue:** Whether the prosecution adequately established the *corpus delicti* (identity of the prohibited drugs).
*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, acquitting the appellant based on reasonable doubt. The prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs.
*   **R.A. 9165, Section 21 Non-Compliance:** Grave failure to comply with the mandatory requirements of Section 21, R.A. 9165 regarding the handling of seized drugs. Specifically:
    *   **Delayed Marking:** PO1 Santos marked the plastic sachets at the police station, *not immediately* after seizure and *not in the presence* of the appellant.
    *   **Lack of Inventory and Photography:** No inventory or photographs of the seized items were taken *in the presence* of the accused and *with required witnesses* (representative from the media, DOJ, and any elected public official).
*   **Chain of Custody:** Prosecution failed to establish the chain of custody, raising doubt as to whether the substances seized were the same ones examined and presented as evidence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Law Enforcement Obligations:** R.A. 9165 imposes a strict duty on law enforcement to meticulously follow the procedures outlined in Section 21 regarding seizure, custody, and documentation of dangerous drugs to ensure the integrity of the *corpus delicti*.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Sections 5 & 11:** defines the crimes of drug sale and possession
*   **R.A. 9165, Section 21:** Outlines the procedure for the custody and disposition of seized drugs.
*   **People v. Laxa, 414 Phil. 156 (2001):** Prior to R.A. 9165, police failed to mark marijuana immediately after apprehension, held that deviation produced doubts about the origins of the marijuana.
*   **People v. Kimura, G.R. No. 130805, 27 April 2004, 428 SCRA 51:** Narcom failed to mark the alleged seized marijuana on the night the accused were arrested and to observe the procedure in the seizure and custody of the drug.
*   **Zaragga v. People, G.R. No. 162064, 14 March 2006, 484 SCRA 639:** Police failed to place markings on the alleged seized shabu immediately after accused was apprehended.
*   **People v. Santos, Jr., G.R. No. 175593, 17 October 2007, 536 SCRA 489:** The court agreed with the Office of the Solicitor General's observation that the identity of the corpus delicti has not been sufficiently established.
*   **People v. Lim, G.R. No. 141699, 7 August 2002, 386 SCRA 581:** Apprehending team having initial control of illegal drugs and/or paraphernalia should, immediately after seizure or confiscation, have the same physically inventoried and photographed in the presence of the accused

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Weak Defense vs. Burden of Proof:** The court reiterated that the prosecution cannot rely on the weakness of the defense and must independently establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty is insufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence and cannot substitute for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Admissibility vs. Probative Value:** The admissibility of evidence does not equate to probative value. Even if drugs are admitted, their evidentiary weight depends on proper compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165.
*   **Chain of Custody is vital:** The ruling underscores the crucial importance of meticulously documenting and preserving the chain of custody for seized drugs in drug-related cases. Non-compliance can lead to acquittal, even if there is evidence suggesting the accused's involvement.
