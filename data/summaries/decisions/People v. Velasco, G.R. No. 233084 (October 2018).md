## Legal Document Summary: People v. Velasco, G.R. No. 233084 (2018)

**Nature:** Appeal of CA decision affirming RTC conviction for Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs (Sections 5 & 11, Article II, RA 9165).

**Holding:** Supreme Court **reversed** the CA decision and **acquitted** Velasco due to a failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The core issue is the compromised chain of custody, specifically concerning the mandatory witness rule under Section 21 of RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640).
*   **Mandatory Witnesses:** The prosecution failed to secure the presence of a representative from the media, Department of Justice (DOJ), or an elected public official during the inventory and photography of seized items. A DAPCO employee's presence was insufficient.
*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution's justification for the absence of required witnesses - alleged connections of the accused with Barangay officials - was deemed "flimsy, self-serving, and unsubstantiated." No actual inquiry into such connections was made.
*   **Integrity of Corpus Delicti:** Due to non-compliance with witness requirements, the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs were compromised, preventing proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Saving Clause (Section 21(a), IRR):** The Court held that the saving clause for justifiable non-compliance did not apply, as the prosecution failed to provide an adequate explanation for the absence of required witnesses.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002)** - Sections 5 & 11 defining Illegal Sale and Possession of Dangerous Drugs.
*   **RA 10640 (Amendment to RA 9165)** - Amended Section 21 concerning chain of custody and witness requirements.
*   **Section 21(a), IRR of RA 9165** - Provides for justifiable grounds for non-compliance with chain of custody.
*   **People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671, January 31, 2018** - Emphasizes the State's positive duty to account for lapses in chain of custody, regardless of whether the defense raises it.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Diligence:** The primary risk identified is the failure to diligently secure the presence of mandatory witnesses or provide a sufficiently justifiable reason for their absence. This exposes the evidence to challenges regarding its integrity.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The court reiterated that the prosecution bears the burden of proving compliance with chain of custody and providing justifiable reasons for deviations from the procedure.
*   **Police Abuse:** The decision underscores the importance of strict compliance with chain of custody procedures to prevent potential police abuses, such as planting of evidence.

**Summary for Lawyer:**
*The People v. Velasco case highlights the critical importance of strict adherence to chain of custody procedures in drug cases, especially regarding mandatory witnesses. The prosecution's failure to justify the absence of media, DOJ, or elected public officials during the inventory and photography resulted in the acquittal, despite a buy-bust operation, emphasizing the significance of the safeguards provided in RA 9165 and its implementing rules. The Court reiterated that mere unsubstantiated suspicion of corruption within the local barangay cannot constitute justifiable grounds for non-compliance. Counsel should scrutinize police documentation to ensure strict compliance, paying close attention to the presence and testimony of the required witnesses.*
