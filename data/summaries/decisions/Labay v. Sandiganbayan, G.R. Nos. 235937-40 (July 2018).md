Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Johanne Edward B. Labay vs. Sandiganbayan, Third Division, and People of the Philippines* (G.R. Nos. 235937-40, July 23, 2018) - a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing Sandiganbayan's denial of reinvestigation and deferment of arrest warrants in PDAF-related criminal cases.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion in denying Labay's motion for reinvestigation, arguing a violation of his right to due process.

**Facts:**

*   Labay, as president of Farmer-business Development Corporation (FDC), was implicated in the alleged anomalous use of PDAF funds by Rep. Cagas IV.
*   Charges: Violation of Art. 217, 171, of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) and Sec. 3(e) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).
*   The Ombudsman attempted to serve the order to file counter-affidavit but was unsuccessful. The Ombudsman proceeded with the preliminary investigation *ex parte*.
*   Labay learned of the charges through press releases and requested information. He was only furnished with a copy of the Resolution finding Probable Cause, not the complaint-affidavit and supporting documents.
*   Labay filed Omnibus Motions for Reinvestigation, which were denied.
*   Informations were filed with the Sandiganbayan.  After filing of the Informations, Labay was finally furnished a copy of the Complaint. He filed an Extremely Urgent Motion with the Sandiganbayan for reinvestigation, which was denied.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversing the Sandiganbayan.
*   The Court held that Labay's constitutional right to due process was violated because he was not furnished a copy of the complaint affidavit and its attachments during the preliminary investigation, despite numerous requests.  This prevented him from effectively presenting a defense.
*   The Court rejected the argument that filing the Omnibus Motion cured the due process violation, emphasizing Labay couldn't adequately respond without seeing the underlying evidence.
*   *Duterte v. Sandiganbayan* was cited, emphasizing the importance of being fully apprised of charges.
*   The Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) was ordered to file motions to withdraw the Informations.

**Dissenting Opinion (Leonen, J.):**

*   Disagreed, citing *De Lima v. Reyes* and related cases. Argued any irregularities in preliminary investigation were moot after the Sandiganbayan's issuance of arrest warrants. The Supreme Court En Banc should have reviewed this case because this ruling conflicts with previous precedence.
*   The Supreme Court should not confuse between the rights of a respondent in preliminary investigation and the constitutional rights of the accused. Due process in a preliminary investigation is statutory, not constitutional.
*   Argued that the Ombudsman complied with the requirement to issue a subpoena.
*   The finding of probable cause had already been determined by the court.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Right to Due Process (Section 1, Article III, 1987 Constitution):**  Guarantees the right to due process before deprivation of life, liberty, or property.
*   **Right to be Informed (Section 14, Article III, 1987 Constitution):** Accused must be informed of the nature and cause of accusation.
*   **Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman (A.O. No. 07):**  Outlines procedure for preliminary investigations (Section 4: procedure to be followed, specifically issuing a subpoena).
*   **Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 112, Section 3:** Outlines procedure for preliminary investigations (Section 3 (b) requires a copy of complaint and supporting documents to be attached to the subpoena).
*   **Ombudsman's Duty:**  To provide the accused copies of the complaint affidavit and supporting documents at the preliminary investigation to allow accused the opportunity to defend oneself.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Violation of Due Process:** Failure to provide access to complaint affidavit and supporting documents invalidates the preliminary investigation.
*   **Reversal of Sandiganbayan Decision:** The SC overturned the SB decision.
*   **Withdrawal of Informations:** OSP required to withdraw information.
*   **Reinvestigation:** The case should be reverted back to the Ombudsman to conduct a complete preliminary investigation.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Duterte v. Sandiganbayan (G.R. No. 130191, April 27, 1998):** Emphasizes the need for the accused to be sufficiently apprised of the charges during the preliminary investigation.
*  **De Lima v. Reyes:** This case highlights the point that after the court has determined a probable cause, any question related to a preliminary investigation becomes moot. The proper course of action after the court finds probable cause is to go to trial.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 217, 171, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Malversation and Falsification of public documents.
*   **Section 3(e) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019:**  Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (causing undue injury to the government through evident bad faith).
*   **Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 07:** Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Certiorari.
*   **Rule 112, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Preliminary Investigation

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "diligent efforts" to serve notice: The Ombudsman claimed diligent efforts, but the Court found them insufficient given Labay's ready availability once he learned of the charges.
*   The extent to which subsequent motions can cure an initial due process violation: The Sandiganbayan argued Labay's motions cured the initial defect, but the Supreme Court disagreed, finding an incomplete opportunity to be heard.

**Potential Arguments for Petitioner (Labay):**

*   The prosecution withheld key pieces of evidence by not including the complaint affidavit.
*   Motion to quash or dismiss the Informations in Sandiganbayan based on lack of a valid preliminary investigation.

**Potential Arguments for the Prosecution (People):**

*   The Ombudsman acted reasonably by resolving the complaint without a counter-affidavit.
*   Labay was hiding and therefore responsible for his lack of notification.
*   The Ombudsman should be given freedom in the determination of Probable Cause, and this should be tried in court.

This is a complex case focusing on the right of the accused to be duly notified of the charges against them. This ruling emphasizes the requirement for providing supporting documents, including the complaint affidavit, and can be used to challenge similar proceedings where the accused was not fully informed.
