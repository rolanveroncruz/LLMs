**Legal Document Summary: People v. Abarides, G.R. No. 235778**

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming RTC conviction of Benie Mon y Abarides for Murder (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code). The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, acquitting the accused.

**Key Provisions & Case Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Abarides was charged with murder for allegedly shooting Uldarico Arroyo. The information alleged treachery and evident premeditation as qualifying aggravating circumstances.
*   **Prosecution's Case:** A witness, Manolo Guevarra, testified he saw Abarides shoot Arroyo. Medical evidence confirmed the cause of death as gunshot wounds.
*   **Defense's Case:** Abarides presented alibi, claiming he was in Capiz at the time of the shooting. He also presented witnesses corroborating his residency and employment in Capiz.
*   **RTC & CA Rulings:** Both courts convicted Abarides, finding the prosecution established guilt beyond reasonable doubt. They gave weight to the positive identification of the accused and dismissed the alibi.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Court reversed the conviction, citing reasonable doubt due to the weakness of the prosecution's evidence and the strength of the defendant's alibi.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Sufficiency of Evidence:** Did the prosecution prove Abarides' guilt for murder beyond a reasonable doubt?
2.  **Alibi Defense:** Was the defense of alibi adequately established? The Court emphasized the "physical impossibility" element of alibi, citing *People v. Anticamara, 666 Phil. 484, 507-508 (2011)*
3.  **Witness Credibility:** Were the inconsistencies in the lone eyewitness's testimony fatal to the prosecution's case? The court applied *People v. Amon, 218 Phil. 355, 361 (1984)* concerning the credibility of witnesses.

**Obligations:**

*   **Prosecution:** Duty to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Accused:** No obligation to prove innocence; presumption of innocence prevails.

**Liabilities (Reversed by SC):**

*   Originally: Reclusion Perpetua, civil indemnity (P50,000), moral damages (P50,000), actual damages (P89,361), exemplary damages (P30,000) and loss of earning capacity (P342,000).
*   Now: None; Abarides acquitted.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Positive Identification vs. Alibi:** The SC emphasized that the positive identification of the accused should not "automatically cancel out the accused's claim that he did not do it". The Court citied *Lejano v. People, 652 Phil. 512 (2010)* which emphasized a judge must keep an open mind.
*   **Weakness of the Prosecution:** The SC found critical inconsistencies in the testimony of the lone eyewitness, including contradictions regarding the lighting conditions and the position of the assailant, undermining the credibility of the prosecution's case. These inconsistencies were material to the elements of the crime and caused the court to dismiss the testimony as unreliable.
