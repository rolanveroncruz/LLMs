*   **Rule 58, Section 5 of the Rules of Court (Preliminary Injunctions):** Violated by issuing a TRO without proper notice, hearing, and extending it unlawfully. *Batas Pambansa Blg. 224* is also mentioned in relation to extending TROs.
*   **Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 20-95 (TROs and Preliminary Injunctions):** Disregarded in relation to the raffle of cases and issuance of TRO. Cited as grounds for *grave abuse of authority, misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice*.

*   **Code of Judicial Conduct (Canon 2, Rule 2.01; Canon 3):** Violated by Judge Adiong's actions which suggested impropriety, bias, and lack of impartiality.

*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Penalties for Simple Misconduct

**Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses and Potential Issues:**

*   **Validity of Substituted Service:** The service of summons through Datu Hassan Mangondaya was deemed invalid.  The court emphasized that the former vice mayor was not authorized by the court nor related to the case.
*   **Raffling Irregularities:** The manipulation of the raffling process by Sybil (and the alleged conspiracy with Maruhom and Adiong) is a major point of contention.
*   **Judge Adiong's Justification:** His reliance on the sheriff's "regular performance" of duties was rejected due to clear evidence of defective service. His claim of urgency for issuing the TRO ex parte was also dismissed, as he did not follow the rules regarding 72-hour TROs.
*   **Maruhom's culpability:** Court found that Maruhom was guilty because his undue haste was instrumental in Judge Adiong issuing a TRO

**Potential Risks and Implications:**

*   **Erosion of Public Trust:** The misconduct of all three respondents damages public confidence in the judiciary.
*   **Reversals of Decisions:** Cases handled by Judge Adiong while engaging in these practices are potentially subject to appeal or review.
*   **Future Litigation:** The improper actions could lead to further legal challenges and complications for the parties involved in Civil Case No. 1912-03.
*   **Systemic Issues:** The case raises concerns about corruption and irregularities within the RTC of Marawi City.

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights serious ethical and procedural violations within the Marawi City RTC. The dismissal of Judge Adiong underscores the Court's intolerance for such misconduct, while the suspensions of Maruhom and Sybil demonstrate the responsibility of court personnel to uphold the integrity of the judicial system.
