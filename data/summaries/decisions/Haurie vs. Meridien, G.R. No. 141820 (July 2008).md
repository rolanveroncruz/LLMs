## Legal Document Summary: Haurie v. Meridien Resources, Inc., 579 Phil. 621 (2008)

**Case Summary:** Petitioners (Haurie, Ebro, and Treasure Land Developers, Inc.) challenged the validity of an amended Master Deed for Le Grand Condominium, particularly the conversion of an administration office into a commercial unit (Unit 103) sold to respondent Lauengco. They argued lack of consent to the conversion.  The HLURB, Office of the President, and ultimately the Court of Appeals (CA) ruled against them. This petition contests the CA's dismissal based on procedural grounds and reiterates the substantive issues.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Master Deed with Declaration of Restrictions:** Governs the condominium project, initially describing an 11-storey building with 49 residential and 2 commercial units.
*   **Amendment of Master Deed:** Allowed MRI (owner-developer) to increase commercial units to 3 (including Unit 103), altering the initially approved plans.
*   **HLURB Alteration of Plan Approval:** Issued to MRI, approving the conversion of the administration office to a commercial unit.
*   **Sale of Condominium Units:** MRI sold units to Haurie, who later transferred one to TLDI. Ebro also purchased a unit. Unit 103 was sold to Lauengco.
*   **Section 6, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court:** Specifies requirements for petitions for review, including attachments of relevant documents. Non-compliance can lead to dismissal per Section 7.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Initially held liable by the OAALA-HLURB for damages and attorney's fees in favor of Century Properties and Lauengco, though this aspect was altered on appeal.
*   **MRI:** Petitioners attempted to hold MRI liable for misrepresentation in sales brochures.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Non-Compliance:**  The CA dismissed the petition for failing to attach required documents, triggering Rule 43, Section 6 and 7 of the Rules of Court.  The Supreme Court upheld this dismissal.
*   **Res Judicata/Law of the Case:** Similar issues were raised in a prior case (CA-G.R. SP No. 53254, affirmed by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. 164999) where the conversion and sale were upheld. This potentially bars relitigation of the same issues.
*   **Lack of Standing/Consent:**  The courts found that MRI altered the plans *before* any unit owners existed, diminishing petitioners' claim that their consent was required.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 43, Sections 6 & 7, Rules of Court:** Governs appeals from quasi-judicial agencies to the Court of Appeals, specifically outlining documentary requirements and consequences for non-compliance.
*   **Manila Hotel Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 143574, July 11, 2002, 384 SCRA 520, 524:**  Cited for the limited circumstances where a liberal construction of the Rules of Court is allowed.
*   **Tan v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 157194, June 20, 2006, 491 SCRA 452, 463:**  Reinforces the principle that final and executory decisions cannot be disturbed.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Amendment of Master Deed:**  The central point of contention revolved around the legality of amending the Master Deed without the consent of future unit owners.  However, the courts emphasized the timing of the amendment (before unit sales) and the HLURB approval as validating factors.
*   **"Undisputed Fact" Allegations:** Petitioners claimed certain facts were undisputed, yet the courts' decisions indicate that these factual assertions were subject to scrutiny and ultimately not persuasive.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *denied* the petition, upholding the Court of Appeals' dismissal based on procedural grounds. The substantive issues regarding the validity of the conversion were deemed already settled in a prior, final decision.
