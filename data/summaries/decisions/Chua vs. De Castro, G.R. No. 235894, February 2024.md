**Case Summary: Chua v. De Castro, G.R. No. 235894 (February 5, 2024)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the RTC's dismissal of a civil case for rescission, breach of contract, and damages related to a construction project.

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC erred in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, asserting that the Construction Industry Arbitration Committee (CIAC) had exclusive jurisdiction.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the RTC erred in dismissing the case.  The RTC's Orders were SET ASIDE and the case was remanded.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Construction Agreement:** An oral agreement existed between Chua (petitioner, homeowner) and De Castro (respondent, contractor) for the construction of a two-storey residential building.
*   **Scope of Work:** De Castro prepared plans, designs, and material specifications, to which Chua acceded.
*   **Payment:** Chua provided PHP 2,241,600.00 to De Castro for the construction.
*   **Breach:** Chua alleged structural defects and deviations from the agreed-upon plan after moving into the house, constituting a breach of contract.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **De Castro's Liability:** Potentially liable for breach of contract, rescission, and damages due to defective construction and deviations from the agreed plan. Significant liability exposure exists regarding rectification costs, consequential damages (discomfort/inconvenience), and potential claims related to diminution in value of the property.
*   **Risk for Chua:** Further legal expenses to pursue the claim in the RTC. Possibility that the RTC may ultimately find no breach, or award less damages than sought.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **E.O. No. 1008 (Construction Industry Arbitration Law):** Section 4 grants the CIAC original and exclusive jurisdiction over construction disputes *only* when the parties agree to submit the dispute to voluntary arbitration.  Crucially, the Court reiterated that *agreement* to arbitrate is a prerequisite for CIAC jurisdiction.
*   **OCA Circular No. 103-2015:** The Court cautioned against the overzealous application of this circular, emphasizing it cannot override the law regarding jurisdiction.
*   **Rule 41, Section 2(c), Rules of Court:** Governing appeals on questions of law.
*   **Relevant Jurisprudence:**
    *   *Almazan v. Bacolod, G.R. No. 227529, June 16, 2021* (jurisdiction as question of law)
    *   *Velasquez v. Lisondra Land, Inc., 880 Phil. 184 (2020)* (jurisdiction conferred by law)
    *   *Camp John Hay Development Corp. v. Charter Chemical and Coating Corp., 858 Phil. 970 (2019)* (agreement to arbitrate required for CIAC jurisdiction)
    *   *Datem, Inc. v. Alphaland Makati Place, Inc., G.R. Nos. 242904-05, February 10, 2021* (arbitration clause as consent)
    *   *Global Medical Center of Laguna, Inc. v. Ross Systems International, Inc., G.R. Nos. 230112 & 230119, May 11, 2021* (CIAC's role in dispute resolution)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Lack of Written Contract:** The absence of a written contract creates evidentiary challenges regarding the specific terms of the agreement, scope of work, and material specifications. Proving the agreed-upon plan will be crucial.
*   **"Agreement to Arbitrate":** No arbitration clause existed in a written contract, nor was there a subsequent agreement to submit the dispute to arbitration. This was the critical factor in the Supreme Court's decision.
*   **Respondent's Default:** Respondent's failure to participate in the proceedings (including failure to file a comment and ignoring court orders) is a significant factor. However, the absence of a defense does not guarantee a full award.
*   **Damages Claim:** Proving the extent of damages and linking them directly to De Castro's breach will be necessary.

**Legal Strategy Recommendations:**

*   Prepare for trial focusing on proving the terms of the oral contract through available evidence (e.g., payment records, testimonies, building plans).
*   Present expert testimony to establish the defects and deviations from acceptable construction standards and linking those deficiencies to the Respondent's actions.
*   Document all repair costs and other consequential damages.
*   Ensure strict compliance with all procedural requirements during the RTC proceedings to avoid further delays or complications.
