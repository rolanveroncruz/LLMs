**Case Summary: *Republic v. N. Dela Merced & Sons, Inc.* (G.R. Nos. 201501 & 201658)**

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision upholding a fine imposed by the DENR-Pollution Adjudication Board (PAB) on N. Dela Merced & Sons, Inc. (Dela Merced) for violation of Section 28 of R.A. 9275 (Clean Water Act of 2004), but reducing the original fine amount.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **R.A. 9275, Sec. 27(i) & Sec. 28:** Prohibits operating a facility that discharges regulated water pollutants without a discharge permit. Imposes a fine of P10,000 to P200,000 per day of violation.
*   **DENR Administrative Order No. 2004-26:** Requires permits to operate air pollution source installations.
*   **P.D. 1586 (Philippine Environmental Impact Statement System):** Establishes the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) system.
*   **Obligation to obtain Discharge Permit (R.A. 9275, Sec. 14)** Owners or operators of facilities that discharge regulated effluents are required to obtain a discharge permit from the DENR.
*   **Obligation to comply with Effluent Standards (R.A. 9275)** Facilities are required to meet the effluent standards set by the DENR.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Fines (R.A. 9275, Sec. 28):** Dela Merced was fined for discharging wastewater that did not meet DENR effluent standards without a permit. The initial fine was P3.98 million, based on P10,000 per day of violation.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Computation of Fine Period:** The period for calculating the fine was disputed. The PAB included the period up to the date of compliant effluent sampling, while the CA reduced it to the date of issuance of the Temporary Lifting Order (TLO). The Supreme Court sided with PAB, finding the issuance of TLO does not equate compliance or proof that the company's effluent has already passed the standards.
*   **Collateral Attack on Constitutionality:** Dela Merced's challenge to the constitutionality of Sec. 28 of R.A. 9275 was considered a collateral attack, as the issue was not raised in a direct proceeding. This is a significant procedural risk.
*   **Excessive Fine Argument:** Dela Merced argued that the fine was excessive under Article III, Section 19(1) of the Constitution. However, the Court ruled this provision only applies to criminal prosecutions and that the fine was within the statutory limits and not "flagrantly and plainly oppressive."

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9275 (Clean Water Act of 2004)**
*   **R.A. 8749 (Clean Air Act of 1999)**
*   **P.D. No. 1586 (Philippine Environmental Impact Statement System)**
*   **Proclamation No. 2146:** Enumerates environmentally critical areas and projects.
*   **Special People, Inc. Foundation v. Canda, 701 Phil. 365 (2013):** Clarifies the purpose and scope of the CNC.
*   **Leynes v. People (G.R. No. 224804, 21 September 2016):** CNC issuance does not exempt compliance with applicable environmental laws.
*   **Serrano v. NLRC, 387 Phil. 345 (2000):** Constitutional prohibition on excessive fines only applies to criminal prosecutions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Effect of CNC:** Dela Merced argued the CNC exempted them from compliance with R.A. 9275. The Court clarified that the CNC only exempts from securing an Environmental Compliance Certificate, not other environmental laws.
*   **Meaning of "unreasonable delay":** The CA invoked "unreasonable delay" on the part of EMB-NCR to reduce fine, a contentious point disputed by DENR-PAB. The Supreme Court sided with PAB and considered the period of sampling to be within the 150-day period provided in the TLO.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court denied Dela Merced's petition and granted the DENR-PAB's petition. The CA decision was modified to reinstate the original fine of P3.98 million. The Court emphasized the importance of protecting water resources and ensuring compliance with environmental laws.
