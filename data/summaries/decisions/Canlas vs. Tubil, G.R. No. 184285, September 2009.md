Here's a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Rodolfo "Rudy" Canlas, et al. vs. Iluminada Tubil* (G.R. No. 184285, September 25, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision which reversed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision and ordered it to decide the unlawful detainer case on its merits.

**Facts:**

*   Iluminada Tubil (Respondent) filed an unlawful detainer complaint against Rodolfo Canlas, et al. (Petitioners) in the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), alleging ownership of a parcel of land (OCT No. 11199) and tolerance of the petitioners' occupation.
*   Respondent demanded the petitioners vacate the property.
*   The petitionersâ€™ defense claimed long-term, adverse possession exceeding 60 years, and asserted that the action was actually an *accion publiciana*, which is beyond the MTC's jurisdiction.
*   MTC dismissed the case, finding that the respondent failed to prove that the petitioners' possession was by mere tolerance.
*   The RTC affirmed the MTC's decision.
*   The CA reversed the RTC's decision, ordering the RTC to decide the case on the merits based on Section 8, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court.

**Issue:** Does the RTC have original jurisdiction over the subject matter such that it can decide the unlawful detainer case on its merits, as ordered by the CA?

**Holding:** No. The Supreme Court (SC) GRANTED the petition and reinstated the MTC's decision. The case was properly an unlawful detainer case within the jurisdiction of the MTC.

**Rationale:**

*   The SC determined that the complaint sufficiently alleged a cause of action for unlawful detainer under the requirements articulated in *Cabrera v. Getaruela*. The essential elements of unlawful detainer were present in the complaint's allegations.
*   The complaint was filed within one year of the last demand to vacate (January 12, 2004 demand, June 9, 2004 complaint), as required by Rule 70, Sec 1.
*   The SC distinguished this case from *Sarmiento v. Court of Appeals*. In *Sarmiento*, the complaint lacked allegations characterizing the entry as legal or illegal, or demonstrating how the dispossession started. The subject case does specify how the possession was through tolerance.
* The timeliness of the filing of the case is the subject. The MTC acquires jurisdiction as the dispossession has not lasted for more than one year.

**Key Provisions & Rules:**

*   **Rule 70, Section 1 of the Rules of Court:** Action for unlawful detainer must be brought within one year from the unlawful withholding of possession, counted from the date of the last demand.
*   **Rule 40, Section 8 of the Rules of Court:** Pertains to appeal from orders dismissing a case. It states that if the MTC tried the case without jurisdiction, the RTC, if it has original jurisdiction, shall not dismiss the case but shall decide it on the merits. This provision was deemed inapplicable.
* **Cabrera v. Getaruela:** Articulates the requirements for a complaint to sufficiently allege a cause of action for unlawful detainer
* **Sarmiento v. Court of Appeals:** Jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint.

**Case Law:**

*   **Cabrera v. Getaruela, G.R. No. 164213, April 21, 2009:**  Defines the requirements of an unlawful detainer case.
*   **Sarmiento v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 116192, November 16, 1995, 250 SCRA 108:** Addresses the necessary allegations in an ejectment complaint for jurisdictional purposes.
*  **Javelosa v. Court of Appeals, 333 Phil. 331, 340 (1996):** Clarifies the application of the Sarona ruling and its relation to establishing the timeliness of filing a complaint with the MTC.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Erroneous Determination of Jurisdiction:** The CA erred in ordering the RTC to decide the case on the merits, since the case was properly within the MTC's jurisdiction.
*   **Incorrect Application of Law:** The CA incorrectly applied Section 8, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court.

**Ambiguities & Contentious Clauses:**

* The disagreement was whether the cause of action was unlawful detainer (MTC jurisdiction) or *accion publiciana* (RTC jurisdiction).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, reinstating the MTC's dismissal of the unlawful detainer case. The key point is that the MTC had jurisdiction because the complaint alleged facts sufficient to establish unlawful detainer.
