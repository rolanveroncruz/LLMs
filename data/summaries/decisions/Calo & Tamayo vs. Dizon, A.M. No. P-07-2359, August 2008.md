## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-07-2359 (Ricardo L. Dizon)

**Nature:** Administrative case against Sheriff Ricardo L. Dizon for neglect of duty.

**Complainants:** Judge Ofelia Calo and Pablea Tamayo.

**Respondent:** Ricardo L. Dizon, Sheriff III.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Main Charge:** Simple neglect of duty in the implementation of writs of execution, attachment, and replevin, service of summons, and timely submission of sheriff's returns.
*   **Civil Case No. 18787 (Tamayo Case):** Delay in implementing writ of execution for unlawful detainer. While the premises were eventually turned over, the monetary judgment was not satisfied. Dizon attributed the initial delay to lack of police assistance.
    *   **Relevant Statute:** Rule 39, Section 14 of the Rules of Court mandates prompt return of writ and periodic reporting.
*   **Civil Case No. 18317 (Brioso Case):** Failure to timely report on the unenforceability of a writ of execution due to lack of leviable properties, prompting the appointment of a special sheriff.
*   **Civil Case No. 19696 (Radiowealth Case):** Refusal to implement a writ of replevin, citing threats from armed security guards and lack of police assistance.
*   **Civil Case No. 19171 (Tuyay Case):** Imprudent custody of attached properties by depositing them with the plaintiff without court approval.
*   **Civil Case No. 19438 (Eagle Financial Case):** Delay in serving summons, allegedly upon the plaintiff's counsel's advice, compromising duty to expedite court processes.
*   **Due Process:** Dizon was given an opportunity to comment on the charges.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Ministerial duty to execute writs promptly and efficiently.
*   Obligation to make timely and accurate returns and periodic reports to the court regarding the status of writs.
*   Obligation to properly secure attached properties.
*   Obligation to serve summons promptly.

**Liabilities:**

*   Originally, the OCA recommended a three-month suspension.
*   The Supreme Court found Dizon guilty of simple neglect of duty, a less grave offense under Section 52(B)(1) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.
*   Given Dizon's death, the Court imposed a fine of P20,000.00 to be deducted from his retirement benefits.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Sheriff's Fee" Issue:** Tamayo claimed Dizon received P10,000 sheriff's fee, but this was not substantiated. Court found no evidence of this misappropriation. This issue highlights the potential for disputes regarding fees and expenses.
*   **Reliance on Plaintiff:** Dizon's defense hinged on the plaintiff's (Tamayo) failure to provide police assistance and the lack of leviable property. This raises questions of a sheriff's independent duty to seek assistance and verify assets.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** Dizon's long service record was considered a mitigating factor in determining the penalty.
*   **Procedural Issues:** Dizon's failure to file a manifestation within the court deadline, resulting in a waiver of his right to submit supplemental comment/pleadings.
*   **The death of the respondent**: The case was resolved with an administrative penalty despite the respondent's death.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 14, Rules of Court:** Pertaining to return of writ of execution.
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Section 52(B)(1):** Defining simple neglect of duty and its penalties.
*   **Mendoza v. Tuquero, 412 Phil. 435 (Sheriff's duties):** Highlights the sheriff's duties in executing judgments and the consequences of failing to do so.
*   **Hon. Barbers v. Judge Laguio, Jr., 404 Phil. 443 (2001):** Case cited regarding the burden of proof in administrative proceedings.
*   **Ayo v. Judge Violago-Isnani, 368 Phil. 19 (1999); Alvarez, Jr. v. Martin, 458 Phil. 85 (2003); Aquino v. Martin, 458 Phil. 76 (2003):** Cases cited in determining the appropriate penalty for neglect of duty.
*   **Escobar Vda. de Lopez v. Luna, A.M. No. P-04-1786 (2006):** The sheriff's duty is purely ministerial and they have no discretion to execute the court's order.

**Conclusion:**

The case illustrates the importance of a sheriff's adherence to procedural rules and diligence in executing court orders. The decision underscores the potential consequences of neglecting those duties and serves as a reminder of the standards expected of court personnel.
