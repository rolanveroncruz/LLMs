## Legal Document Summary: Empire Insurance Company vs. NLRC and Andal (G.R. No. 121879)

**Case Summary:** This case involves a surety company, Empire Insurance, attempting to disclaim solidary liability for the monetary claims of an overseas Filipino worker (OFW), Monera Andal, against the recruitment agency, G & M Phils., Inc., bonded by Empire. Andal claimed illegal dismissal, non-payment, and underpayment of salaries.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Suretyship Agreement:** Empire Insurance entered into a suretyship agreement with G & M Phils., Inc., binding itself to answer for the debts or default of the recruitment agency.
*   **Solidary Liability:** The Court affirmed the solidary liability of Empire Insurance with G & M Phils., Inc. for Andal's monetary claims. This means Andal can recover the full amount from either party.
*   **POEA Rules:** The ruling reinforces the purpose of surety bonds required by POEA, which is to ensure recourse for OFWs against local recruitment agencies if their rights are violated by foreign employers.
*   **Impleading Surety Companies:** POEA can implead surety companies in administrative complaints against recruitment agencies, and the surety is bound by the POEA judgment (Finman General Assurance Corporation vs. NLRC, 210 SCRA 675; Del Rosario vs. NLRC, 187 SCRA 777).

**Liabilities:**

*   Empire Insurance is liable for:
    *   Salary differentials for four months (US$200).
    *   Salaries for the unexpired portion of the contract (16.5 months).
*   The liability is solidary with G & M Phils., Inc.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Joint and Several Liability:** Empire Insurance bears the risk of paying the entire judgment amount if G & M Phils., Inc. is unable to or fails to pay.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Garcia, Jr. vs. CA, 191 SCRA 493:** Defines suretyship as an agreement where one person (surety) engages to be answerable for the debt of another (principal).
*   **Philippine National Bank vs. Pineda, 197 SCRA 1; Finman General Assurance Corporation vs. Salik, 188 SCRA 740:**  States that a surety is considered the same party as the debtor in relation to the obligation and their liabilities are inseparable.
*   **Cuadra vs. NLRC, 207 SCRA 279; Hellenic Philippine Shipping, Inc. vs. Siete, 195 SCRA 179:** Reinforces the constitutional mandate to protect the working class and joint and several liability of agencies and employers.
*   **Stronghold Insurance Co., Inc. vs. CA, 205 SCRA 605:** Upholds the purpose of POEA-required surety bonds.
*   **Rule 65 (Certiorari):**  Defines the proper mode of appeal from the NLRC to the Supreme Court which is through a Petition of Certiorari

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   Empire Insurance argued that Andal's seeking mediation from the Philippine Embassy shifted the burden of proof to her. The Court dismissed this argument.
*   Empire Insurance argued that its liability was merely subsidiary. The Court rejected this argument, citing the solidary nature of the suretyship agreement.
*   Empire initially filed the wrong mode of appeal (Rule 45 Petition of Review) which was corrected by the Supreme Court to a Rule 65 Petition of Certiorari in the interest of justice.
