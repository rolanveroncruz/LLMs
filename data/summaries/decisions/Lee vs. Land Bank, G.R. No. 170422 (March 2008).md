**Summary of *Sps. Edmond Lee and Helen Huang v. Land Bank of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 170422 (2008)**

**Key Issue:** Determination of just compensation for land compulsorily acquired under R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law).

**Facts:**
*   Petitioners (landowners) rejected Land Bank of the Philippines' (LBP) valuation of P315,307.87 for 3.195 hectares.
*   DARAB affirmed LBP's valuation.
*   Petitioners filed a petition in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) acting as a Special Agrarian Court (SAC) for the determination of just compensation.
*   SAC ruled in favor of petitioners, awarding P7,978,750.00, relying heavily on a prior similar case (Civil Case No. 7171) and an appraisal report.
*   LBP appealed, arguing the SAC erred in relying on the appraisal report and disregarding R.A. No. 6657 and its implementing regulations (DAR Administrative Order No. 5, Series of 1998 - "AO No. 5").

**Court of Appeals Decision:**
*   Reversed the SAC decision, finding the SAC improperly took judicial notice of its previous decision in Civil Case No. 7171, which wasn't final.
*   Faulted the SAC for solely adopting the appraisal company's valuation without considering the factors outlined in Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657.
*   Ordered the case remanded to the trial court for proper determination of just compensation, stating that the SAC should appoint commissioners under Section 5, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court.

**Supreme Court Decision:**
*   Denied the petition for review, affirming the CA decision to remand the case, but modifying the ruling on appointment of commissioners.
*   Acknowledged the SAC could take judicial notice of its previous decision given that petitioners presented testimonial and documentary evidence from that case.
*   Agreed with the Court of Appeals that the SAC's reliance on the private appraisal company's valuation was misplaced because it did not utilize the factors stipulated under R.A. No. 6657 and AO No. 5.
*   Clarified that the appointment of commissioners is discretionary, not mandatory, under Section 58 of R.A. No. 6657.
*   Remanded to the Special Agrarian Court for proper determination of just compensation.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**
*   **R.A. No. 6657, Section 17:** Specifies factors to be considered in determining just compensation (cost of acquisition, current value of like properties, nature, actual use, income, owner's valuation, tax declarations, government assessments, social and economic benefits, non-payment of taxes/loans).
*   **DAR Administrative Order No. 5 (AO No. 5):** Provides a basic formula for land valuation (LV = (CNI x 0.6) + (CS x 0.3) + (MV x 0.1)), based on Capitalized Net Income (CNI), Comparable Sales (CS), and Market Value (MV).
*   **R.A. No. 6657, Section 58:** Allows (but does not mandate) the SAC to appoint commissioners to examine, investigate, and ascertain facts relevant to the dispute, including property valuation.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**
*   **LBP Liability:** Obligation to pay just compensation for the acquired land. The exact amount remains to be determined by the SAC.
*   **Petitioners Risk:** Undervaluation of land if proper factors are not considered.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Primary law governing the case.
*   **DAR Administrative Order No. 5, Series of 1998 (AO No. 5):** Implementing guidelines for land valuation under CARP.
*   **Section 5, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court:** Procedural rules for expropriation (relevant but appointment of commissioners not mandatory)
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Spouses Banal, 478 Phil. 701 (2004):** Reaffirms the need to adhere to AO No. 5 in determining just compensation.
*   **T’boli Agro – Industrial Dev’t., Inc. v. Solipapsi, 442 Phil. 499 (2002) & Consolidated Cases of Land Bank of the Phils. v. Wycoco, 464 Phil. 83 (2004):** Regarding taking judicial notice in related cases.
*   **Alzua and Arnalot. v. Johnson, 21 Phil. 308 (l912):** Pertaining to the taking of judicial notice.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Application of Section 5, Rule 67:** The extent to which expropriation rules under the Rules of Court apply to agrarian reform cases, specifically regarding the mandatory appointment of commissioners. Resolved by the Supreme Court in favor of discretionary appointment under Section 58 of R.A. No. 6657.
*   **Weight given to private appraisal reports:**  The SC made it clear these cannot be wholesale adopted without linking back to the statutory formulas and considerations.

**Legal Strategy Notes:**

* On remand, the case requires the SAC to meticulously apply the formula outlined in AO No. 5, alongside considering the factors in Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657. Parties will have the option to request the court to appoint commissioners. Careful consideration is required to determine if the benefit of a more detailed analysis offsets the costs and potential delays of such an appointment.
