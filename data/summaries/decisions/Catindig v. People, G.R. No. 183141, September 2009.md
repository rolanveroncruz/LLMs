## Legal Document Summary: *Catindig v. People and Fandiño* (G.R. No. 183141, September 18, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the CA's decision to annul RTC orders for warrant of arrest and *pendente lite* suspension of Atty. Fandiño (and co-accused) as Chairman/Members of the Board of Directors of the Calamba Water District (CWD) due to a violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**
*   **COA Audit:** Found that the CWD Board granted themselves and employees benefits/allowances (P15,455,490.14 total) purportedly without legal basis and exceeding allowable limits, violating Section 13 of PD 198 (Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973).
*   **Ombudsman Charges:** Petitioner filed a complaint with the Ombudsman, leading to the filing of two Informations against Atty. Fandiño and others for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.  This case (Crim. Case No. 13850-05-C) concerns the alleged unlawful granting of P4,378,908.00 in benefits to themselves.
*   **RTC Orders:** The RTC found probable cause, issued an arrest warrant, and ordered a 60-day *pendente lite* suspension pursuant to Section 13 of RA 3019.
*   **CA Decision:** Reversed the RTC, finding that the Board received allowances in good faith, based on LWUA Resolution No. 313, before it was declared illegal. The CA emphasized the need for "manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence" for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, which it found absent.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether the CA erred in ruling on the merits of the case (good faith) within a certiorari proceeding, which is limited to correcting errors of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.
2.  Whether the CA should have dismissed the case based on *res judicata* due to a prior dismissed petition involving the same issues (CA-G.R. SP No. 92474).

**Court's Ruling (Affirming CA):**

*   **Certiorari & Probable Cause:** While denial of a motion to dismiss is generally not subject to certiorari, an exception exists where special circumstances demonstrate the inadequacy of appeal. The Court found insufficient evidence to establish probable cause for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 and issuance of the arrest warrant.
*   **Lack of Manifest Partiality, Bad Faith, or Gross Negligence:** The Board relied on LWUA Resolution No. 313 in granting benefits. This was deemed to be an act of good faith, as *Baybay Water District v. Commission on Audit* (425 Phil. 326 (2002)) and *De Jesus v. Commission on Audit* (451 Phil. 812 (2003)), which declared LWUA Resolution 313 invalid, came after the relevant period of resolution.  Good faith is presumed; bad faith must be proven.
*   ***Res Judicata* Inapplicable:** The prior case (CA-G.R. SP No. 92474) was dismissed based on technicalities (e.g., failure to indicate IBP number), not on the merits.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The CWD Board has an obligation to adhere to PD 198, as amended, regarding compensation for board members. The benefits and allowances granted should have been re-evaluated.
*   Public officials must act without manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.

**Potential Risks:**

*   While this specific criminal case is dismissed due to lack of probable cause at this stage, future actions by the CWD board in relation to the granting of benefits may still result in legal liabilities if they run counter to established regulations. It should also be noted that *Catindig* does not prevent future criminal prosecution, should more conclusive evidence be presented.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 13:** Suspension and Loss of Benefits (for criminal prosecution).

*   ***De Jesus v. Commission on Audit* (451 Phil. 812 (2003)):** Court declared the resolution invalid.
*   ***Principio v. Barrientos*, G.R. No. 167025, 19 December 2005, 478 SCRA 639:** Addressed procedural issues (certiorari), and lack of probable cause.
*   ***Soriano v. Marcelo*, G.R. No. 160772, 13 July 2009:**  Interpreted the terms "manifest partiality", "evident bad faith", and "gross inexcusable negligence" under Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019.
*   ***Albert v. Sandiganbayan*, G.R. No. 164015, 26 February 2009:** Addressed "manifest partiality", "evident bad faith", and "gross inexcusable negligence" under Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "good faith" reliance on LWUA Resolution No. 313 before its invalidation is a central contentious point. The line between good faith and "gross inexcusable negligence" in applying a possibly unlawful resolution may be difficult to discern. This could set precedence for future similar cases.
