## Summary of *Sps. Pacho v. Judge Lu*

**Case:** AM No. RTJ-13-2350, *Sps. Alberto and Lilian Pacho v. Judge Agapito S. Lu*

**Holding:** Judge Lu found guilty of undue delay in resolving Civil Case No. N-7675 and fined P11,000.00 to be charged against withheld retirement benefits.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Constitutional Mandate (Art. VIII, Sec. 15(1)):** First and second-level courts must decide cases within three months of submission.
*   **Code of Judicial Conduct:** Judges must administer justice impartially, without delay, and promptly dispose of court business.
*   **Rule 140, Rules of Court:** Undue delay in resolving a case is classified as a less serious charge.
*   **Section 15(2), Article VIII, 1987 Constitution.** A case or matter shall be deemed submitted for decision or resolution upon the filing of the last pleading, brief, or memorandum required by the Rules of Court or by the court itself.
*   **Rule 1.02, Canon 1** Judges must administer justice impartially and without delay.
*   **Rule 3.02, Canon 3** Judges must promptly dispose of their courts' business and decide their cases within the required periods.
*   **Section 11 (B), Rule 140, Rules of Court.** Penalty for undue delay in resolving a case: suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one nor more than three months; or a fine of more than P10,000.00 but not exceeding P20,000.00

**Obligations:**

*   Judges have a constitutional and ethical obligation to resolve cases within the prescribed timeframes.
*   Judges must request extensions in writing with meritorious grounds if they cannot meet deadlines.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Lu incurred liability for failing to resolve the appeal within the mandatory period, despite being ripe for adjudication and follow-ups by complainants.
*   Judge Lu was liable for delay of five years from the time he should have resolved the case to the lodging of the complaint.
*   A fine may be imposed for undue delay, per Rule 140, Rules of Court.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Justification for Delay:** Judge Lu's defense of a "judicial ping-pong" due to the lower court's insistence on lack of jurisdiction was rejected. The Supreme Court (SC) emphasized that Judge Lu should have resolved the appeal and allowed parties to seek remedies.
*   **Impact of Retirement:** While retirement prevents suspension, the SC can still impose a fine.
*   **Remanding of the case** The SC believed that Judge Lu should have rendered judgment by stating so and at the same time dismissing the case for lack of original jurisdiction over it. He should not think of remanding the case again to the MTCC.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Reyes:* Underscores the importance of judicial efficiency and diligence in resolving disputes.
*   *Petallar v. Pullos* Judges must perform their official duties with utmost diligence if public confidence in the judiciary is to be preserved.

**Statutory References:**

*   1987 Constitution, Article VIII, Section 15(1) and 15(2)
*   Rule 140, Rules of Court, Section 9 and 11(B).
*   Rule 1.02, Canon 1
*   Rule 3.02, Canon 3

**Concise Summary:**

Retired Judge Lu was found guilty of undue delay in resolving an ejectment case appeal, specifically for a five-year delay in resolving a second appeal. His defense of a jurisdictional dispute with the lower court was rejected. This violated constitutional mandates and the Code of Judicial Conduct for timely resolution of cases. The court imposed a fine of P11,000, deducted from his retirement benefits. This case underscores the judiciary's emphasis on efficient resolution of cases and accountability of judges, even after retirement, for failing to meet mandated timelines. The SC ruled that even if the RTC judge disagreed with the MTCC, he should have rendered judgment in the case. He should not have remanded the case back to the MTCC.
