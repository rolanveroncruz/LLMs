Okay, here's a markdown summary of the provided legal document, aiming for conciseness and legal precision:

**Case:** *Cagang v. Sandiganbayan, Office of the Ombudsman, and People of the Philippines* (G.R. Nos. 206438, 206458, 210141-42, July 31, 2018)

**Issue:** Whether the Sandiganbayan gravely abused its discretion in denying Cagang's Motion to Quash/Dismiss due to the Office of the Ombudsman's alleged inordinate delay in the preliminary investigation.

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court DENIED the petitions, lifting the Temporary Restraining Order.  It directed the Sandiganbayan to resolve the cases with dispatch.  The Court established revised guidelines for determining inordinate delay.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Constitutional Right to Speedy Disposition:**  Reaffirmed the right under Article III, Section 16 of the Constitution, distinct from the right to speedy trial. This right applies to all tribunals, not just courts.
*   **Inordinate Delay Defined:**  Delay is determined not by "mere mathematical reckoning" but by examining facts and circumstances. Courts must consider what a competent public officer would reasonably need given the case's complexity. Delay beyond established timeframes shifts the burden to the prosecution to justify the delay.
* **Accusation:** A case is deemed to have started from the filing of the formal complaint and the preliminary investigation not when fact-finding or motu proprio investigations start.
*   **Burden of Proof:**
    *   **Delay within prescribed periods:** Accused bears the burden to prove the delay was inordinate AND that the defense did not contribute to the delay. And that the delay was malicious or politically motivated.
    *   **Delay beyond prescribed periods:** Prosecution bears the burden to prove the delay was reasonable, procedure was followed, complexity of issues and volume of evidence made delay inevitable, AND no prejudice resulted to the accused.
*   **Factors in Determining Inordinate Delay (Modified *Barker v. Wingo* Test):**
    1.  Length of the delay.
    2.  Reasons for the delay.
    3.  Acquiescence, the defendant's assertion or non-assertion of his or her right (Failure to invoke constitutional rights in a timely manner is a WAIVER).
    4.  Prejudice to the defendant, which shifts burden to the prosecution.
*   **Waiver:** Failure to invoke right to speedy disposition during preliminary investigation can be considered a waiver. But such waiver cannot be based on silence, but rather, simultaneously anchored on acts indicative of an intent to relinquish.
*   **Remedy for Denial of Motion to Quash:**  Certiorari is available *only* if the denial was tainted with grave abuse of discretion *and* appeal wouldn't provide adequate relief. Proceed to trial is the usual course.
*  **Justification of Delays:** The Prosecution must justify actions done from July 12, 2005 to June 17, 2010. Stating that transactions were complex is not enough justification.
* The Court held that it is the duty of the prosecution to speed up prosecution of the case regardless of the respondent objects to the delay or not.
*   **Abandonment of *People v. Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division* Holding:**The ruling that fact-finding investigations are included in the period for determination of inordinate delay is ABANDONED
*   **Institutional Delay:**The failure of the Office of the Ombudsman should not be based in institutional delay. The Office must still respect the constitutional guarantees against the private citizens.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Article III, Sections 14(2) and 16 of the 1987 Constitution (Rights to Speedy Trial and Speedy Disposition).
*   Republic Act No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989).
*   Rule 112, Rules of Court (Preliminary Investigation Procedure).
*   *Tatad v. Sandiganbayan* (242 Phil. 563) (Inordinate Delay Principle).
*   *Barker v. Wingo*, ( Balancing test)
*   *People v. Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division* (723 Phil. 444) (Abandoned holding on fact-finding investigations).
*   *Dela Peña v. Sandiganbayan* (412 Phil. 921) (Waiver of right, but needs careful consideration).
*   *Remulla v. Sandiganbayan* (Accused has no duty to follow up case).
*   *Coscolluela v. Sandiganbayan*(It is the duty of the prosecutor to expedite the prosecution of the case regardless of whether the accused objects to the delay or not).
* *People v. Macasaet*, G.R. Nos. 196094 (the silence of the accused during such period [of delay] could not be viewed as an unequivocal act of waiver of their right to speedy determination of their cases).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Determination of "Reasonable Period":** Highly fact-dependent, leaves significant room for interpretation and potential challenges. The factors for "reasonable period" are still left in the air.
*   **Waiver by Inaction:** The dissent highlights that this is a dangerous premise that the inaction from the individual could waive his or her rights.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   Cagang remains subject to prosecution in the Sandiganbayan.
*   Office of the Ombudsman needs to streamline preliminary investigation procedures to avoid future claims of inordinate delay. The burden is with them to justify the delays.
*   Continued reliance on *Dela Peña* could lead to unjust results if the courts do not consider all Barker Factors, instead of only the waiver factor.

**Actionable Items:**

*   For the Office of the Ombudsman: Revise internal rules to establish clearer, reasonable deadlines for preliminary investigations, considering case complexity, and codifying the principles outlined in this decision. They must justify delays.

This summary should provide a lawyer with a good overview of the document and its implications.
