## Legal Document Summary: Plaza v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 138464, January 18, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to annul the CA decision lifting preventive suspension orders against private respondents (Tan, Gilsano, Quismundo) and ordering their reinstatement with backwages.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Preventive Suspension (Section 85, LGC of 1991 [RA 7160]):** Local Chief Executives may preventively suspend subordinate officials/employees for up to 60 days pending investigation of charges involving dishonesty, oppression, grave misconduct, or neglect of duty, or reasonable belief of guilt warranting removal.
*   **Administrative Investigation:** Requires a Provincial Investigating Committee (PIC) to conduct hearings and submit findings/recommendations.
*   **Reinstatement & Backwages (Section 88, LGC of 1991 [RA 7160]):** Suspended respondent entitled to rights/privileges only upon exoneration. Entitlement to backwages requires both exoneration and unjustified suspension (Gloria v. Court of Appeals).
*   **Section 85(b), R.A. 7160:** Undue delay in the proceedings caused by respondent, the time shall not be counted in computing the period of suspension.
*   **Reconvening of the PIC**: The Supreme Court orders for PIC to reconvene and continue the administrative investigation against the private respondents with reasonable dispatch.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Provincial Government:** Potential liability for backwages if respondents are eventually exonerated and the suspension is deemed unjustified, though this has been ruled out given private respondents were not absolved.
*   **Investigating Committee:** Obligation to conduct fair and impartial investigation. Delay could lead to claims of denial of due process. Failure to provide due process can lead to reversal by the CSC and Courts, exposing local government to damages.
*   **Appointive Local Officials/Employees:** Risk of preventive suspension based on allegations of misconduct/dishonesty, potentially impacting reputation and livelihood.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160), Sections 85 and 88:** Governs preventive suspension and rights of suspended officials.
*   **COA Circular No. 86-257:** Cash advance liquidation guidelines.
*   **Gloria v. Court of Appeals, 365 Phil. 744 (1999):** Establishes standard for backwage entitlement requiring both exoneration and unjustified suspension.
*   **Layug v. Quisumbing, G.R. No. 82272, February 7, 1990:** Clarifies that employees are only entitled to back salaries when they are found innocent of the charges, and that their suspension was likewise unjustified.
*   **CSC Resolution No. 93-1765:** Designating Fe Tan-Cebrian as substitute Provincial Government Department Head of the Office of the Provincial Planning and Development Coordinator

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Justification for Preventive Suspension:** Whether there was sufficient basis to believe respondents were guilty of charges to warrant removal.
*   **Impact of RTC Petition on Suspension Period:** The interruption of the preventive suspension due to filing of action with the RTC. The SC ultimately ruled against the CA's opinion.
*   **Backwages entitlement**: The SC deleted the award of backwages as the private respondents are not entitled to backwages because their suspension was authorized by law and they have not been absolved of the administrative charges filed against them.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court, in this case, reviews a Court of Appeals decision regarding the preventive suspension and reinstatement of three provincial government officials. The Court ultimately **MODIFIED** the CA decision by **DELETING** the award of backwages to the suspended officials because they were not absolved of the administrative charges filed against them. The SC remanded the case to the Provincial Investigating Committee to resolve the administrative cases against the private respondents, and the CA was found to have erred in ordering the immediate reinstatement of the private respondents with backwages, given that the administrative charges were still unresolved.
