Here's a legal summary of the provided administrative case:

**Case:** *Cesar T. Duque v. Jaarmy G. Bolus-Romero and Ma. Consuelo Joie A. Fajardo* (A.M. No. P-16-3507, September 25, 2018)

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint for Falsification of Public Documents, Inefficiency, and Incompetence.

**Complainant:** Cesar T. Duque

**Respondents:**
*   Jaarmy G. Bolus-Romero, Clerk of Court V
*   Ma. Consuelo Joie A. Fajardo, Sheriff IV

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Clerk of Court (Bolus-Romero):** The complaint against Bolus-Romero for allegedly altering the interest rate in the writ of execution was **dismissed for lack of merit.** The Court found that she merely copied the dispositive portions of the RTC and CA decisions verbatim in the writ, fulfilling her ministerial duty under Section 4, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court, and relevant jurisprudence. The Court emphasized the importance of a writ of execution mirroring the judgment.
*   **Sheriff (Fajardo):** Fajardo was found **guilty of gross inefficiency and incompetence** in the performance of official duties, and simple neglect of duty.  The basis was the flawed Notice of Sheriff's Sale, specifically the incorrect Torrens Title number of the property, invalidated the ensuing sheriff's sale. The court held that such errors were substantial and that the notice's publication serves a critical public interest, preventing fire sales and inviting competitive bidding.
*   **Penalty:** Due to Fajardo's prior dismissal in *Gillera v. Fajardo* (A.M. No. P-14-3237, October 21, 2014) for dishonesty and conduct unbecoming an officer, the Court imposed a **fine of P50,000.00**. While inefficiency and neglect typically warrant suspension under Rule 10, paragraphs B.4 and D.1 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACS) , her prior dismissal rendered suspension moot.
*   **Implied Admission:** The Court noted Fajardo's failure to respond to the complaint or explain her actions as an implied admission of the charges.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Clerks of Court must ensure writs of execution accurately reflect the judgment.
*   Sheriffs have a duty to exercise care and diligence in implementing writs, particularly regarding the accuracy and completeness of notices of sale to uphold faith in the judiciary ( *Office of the Court Administrator v. Macusi, Jr.*, A.M. No. P-13-3105, September 11, 2013, 705 SCRA 377, 390)

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The case highlights the potential for administrative liability arising from errors in execution proceedings. Even seemingly minor errors in notices of sale can have significant consequences.
*   Sheriffs must be vigilant in ensuring accuracy of the notice to pay and notice of sale to avoid future problems

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   Section 4, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court (Ministerial Duties of Clerks of Court)
*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Macusi, Jr.*, A.M. No. P-13-3105, September 11, 2013, 705 SCRA 377, 390 (Sheriff's duty to public and the judicial system)
*    *Gillera v. Fajardo*, A.M. No. P-14-3237 (formerly OCA I.P.I. No. 09-3256-P), October 21, 2014, 738 SCRA 632
*   Rule 10, paragraphs B.4 and D.1 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACS)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The decision does not delve into the specific factual circumstances surrounding the alleged "sham auction sale" aside from the flawed notice, which is a potential area for further inquiry, though rendered moot by Fajardo's prior dismissal.
