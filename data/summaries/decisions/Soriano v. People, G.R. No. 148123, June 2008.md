## Legal Document Summary: *Rene Soriano v. People* (G.R. No. 148123)

This case involves the conviction of Rene Soriano for the complex crime of Homicide with Frustrated Homicide. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision which upheld the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime:** Complex crime of Homicide with Frustrated Homicide under Article 249 in relation to Article 250 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).
*   **Facts:** Soriano shot Ernesto Amarillo (resulting in death) and Soledad Ferrer (resulting in serious injuries) on December 29, 1994. The prosecution's key witness, Benjamin Cabansag, positively identified Soriano as the shooter.
*   **Defense:** Soriano presented an alibi, claiming he was at his military base in Camp Boloan, Kalinga, Apayao, at the time of the shooting. He presented supporting documents and testimonies from fellow army officers.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Soriano:** Convicted and sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of six (6) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor*, as minimum to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal*, as maximum. Liable to indemnify the heirs of Ernesto Amarillo and Soledad Ferrer.
*   **Indemnification:** Initially, the RTC ordered Soriano to pay P50,000 to Amarillo's heirs and P20,000 to Ferrer as civil indemnity. The SC modified this, adding P50,000 in **moral damages** to both the heirs of Amarillo and Soledad Ferrer.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Soriano's Alibi:** The courts found the alibi unconvincing. Even if true, the distance was not so great as to make his presence at the crime scene impossible. The court also cited the ease with which documents can be fabricated, especially considering he and supporting witnesses were all in the military.
*   **Weaknesses in Prosecution Case:** The defense argued inconsistencies and the failure to call other potential witnesses. However, the court upheld the single eyewitness testimony of Cabansag, finding it credible and positive.
*   **Credibility:** The court noted the oddity in Soriano's reaction to the death of his brother (also a victim of the shooting), finding his lack of inquiry into the death suspicious and damaging to his credibility.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The case highlights the tension between the right of the accused to present an alibi and the difficulty of disproving a credible, positive identification by a witness. The court gives deference to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
* The award of moral damages even without "allegation and proof of emotional suffering" signals a shift to automatically awarding it in cases of violent deaths, acknowledging inherent pain and suffering.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld Soriano's conviction, prioritizing the positive identification by the eyewitness over the alibi defense. The addition of moral damages underscores the gravity of the crime and its impact on the victims and their families. There are no clear avenues for appeal given the SC's affirmation.
