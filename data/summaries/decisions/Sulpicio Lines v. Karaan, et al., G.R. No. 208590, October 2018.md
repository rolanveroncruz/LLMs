## Legal Document Summary: Sulpicio Lines, Inc. v. Karaan, G.R. No. 208590 (Oct. 3, 2018)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA Decision modifying the RTC decision regarding damages awarded to passengers/survivors of the M/V Princess of the Orient sinking. The case is based on breach of contract of carriage.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract of Carriage:** Sulpicio Lines (now Philippine Span Asia Carrier Corporation) had a contract of carriage with the respondents, obligating them to transport them safely.
*   **Duty of Extraordinary Diligence:** As a common carrier, Sulpicio Lines was bound to exercise extraordinary diligence for the safety of its passengers. Their failure to exercise extraordinary diligence resulted in a legal breach of contract.
*   **Damages:** Addresses the types and amounts of damages recoverable in cases involving breach of contract of carriage, specifically moral, temperate, exemplary, and attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   The SC affirmed the awarding of (a) Moral Damages, (b) Temperate Damages and (c) Exemplary Damages.
*   Sulpicio Lines is liable for damages arising from the breach of its contract of carriage with the respondents due to the sinking of the M/V Princess of the Orient. The liability stems from the negligence and recklessness of the ship's captain and crew (as found by the BMI), and the company's failure to exercise extraordinary diligence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Actual Damages:** The CA found the respondents' proof of actual damages insufficient, leading to the award of temperate damages instead. This could be a point of contention as the respondents may argue for a higher award based on actual losses. *See Article 2224 of the Civil Code for legal basis on the awarding of Temperate Damages.*
*   **Exemplary Damages (Article 2232, Civil Code):** Petitioner contested the exemplary damage award, arguing that it was not proven that their actions were "wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent". The SC relies on the finding of the Court of Appeals, particularly in the ruling of *Sulpicio Lines, Inc. v. Sesante et. al.*, in relation to the actions of the Captain of the vessel.
*   **Interest Rate:** The decision modifies the interest rate to 6% per annum from the finality of the decision, adhering to *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. CA* and *Nacar v. Gallery Frames, et al.*, potentially affecting the total amount payable.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Article 2224 (Temperate Damages), Articles 2229-2234 (Exemplary Damages).
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. CA (304 Phil. 236 (1994)):** Guidelines for the award of Legal Interest.
*   **Nacar v. Gallery Frames, et al. (716 Phil. 267 (2013)):** Modification of Eastern Shipping Lines guidelines.
*   **Sulpicio Lines, Inc. v. Sesante et. al. (791 Phil. 409 (2016)):** Precedent case involving similar claims against Sulpicio Lines for the same incident, cited by the court for the award of exemplary damages.
*   **Marchan v. Mendoza:** This case is cited in *Sulpicio Lines, Inc. v. Sesante et. al.*

**Ambiguities:**

*   The primary ambiguity concerns the extent to which the respondents successfully demonstrated actual losses. The CA's determination that they did not compels the award of temperate damages.
*   The assessment of specific actions demonstrating wanton or reckless behavior justifying exemplary damages can be subjective, potentially leading to future arguments about the appropriateness of the award.

**Overall Assessment:** The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision, finding Sulpicio Lines liable. The decision establishes a precedent for awarding temperate and exemplary damages in similar cases of maritime accidents involving negligence by common carriers.
