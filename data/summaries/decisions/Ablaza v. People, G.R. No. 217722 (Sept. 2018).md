**Case Summary: *Ablaza v. People*** (G.R. No. 217722, September 26, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which affirmed with modification the RTC decision finding the Petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Robbery with Violence Against or Intimidation of Persons under paragraph 5, Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Robbery with Violence Against or Intimidation of Persons (Art. 294(5) RPC).
*   **Facts:** Victim Snyder was walking while using her cellphone when two men on a motorcycle grabbed her three necklaces. She identified Ablaza as the driver to the police.
*   **RTC Decision:** Found Ablaza guilty of Robbery under Art. 294(5), finding all elements present.  Sentenced to imprisonment of four (4) years and two (2) months as minimum to eight (8) years and twenty (20) days as maximum. The accused are also ordered solidarily to pay Rosario Snyder the amount of Php70,100.00 with interest at 6% per annum until the full amount is paid; and to pay the cost of suit.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC's finding of guilt, finding all elements present. Also found that there was use of violence and physical force used in the commission of the crime. Modified only the penalty calculation, clarifying interest accrual from the finality of the judgment.
*   **SC Decision:** *Partially granted the Petition*. Upheld the factual findings regarding identification and credibility of the witness. *Reversed the conviction for Robbery* and convicted Ablaza of **Theft** (Art. 309(3) RPC), finding no violence or intimidation.
*   **Rationale for Theft:** The Court said that there was no violence or intimidation in the taking (People v. Alfeche, Jr.). The act of "grabbing" does not necessarily equate to violence (citing People v. Concepcion). The victim did not sustain any injury, nor did she provide any showing that the defendants were pushed, or harmed during the commission of the crime.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Original RTC/CA:** Solidary liability with co-accused Lauzon for Php70,100 with interest (robbery conviction).
*   **SC Ruling:** Liable for **Theft**. Indeterminate penalty of six (6) months of arresto mayor as minimum, to two (2) years, eleven (11) months and ten (10) days of prision correccional as maximum.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):**
    *   Art. 293 (Robbery Definition)
    *   Art. 294 (Robbery with Violence Against or Intimidation of Persons)
    *   Art. 309 (Theft Penalties)
*   **Republic Act No. 10951 (Amending RPC Theft Values)**

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Risk:** The prosecution initially secured a heavier conviction for robbery. The SC decision hinges on a narrow interpretation of "grabbing" versus "violence" in the context of Art. 294.
*   **Ambiguity:** The court noted that the prosecution failed to show any kind of injury. The court noted that while one can only imagine how pulling three necklaces at the same time from the victim's neck could not have caused any mark, bruise, or pain to the latter, suffice it to state that such a matter must have been adequately proved by the prosecution during trial.
*   **Contradiction:**  It is not clear why the court focused on the absence of injury given that simple Robbery under 294(5) RPC requires only violence against or intimidation of persons which do not necessarily require injury. The Court also notes that the use of force is not an element of the crime of simple robbery.
*   **Case Law Reliance:** Significant reliance on *People v. Concepcion* to establish that snatching, absent specific evidence of violence/intimidation, constitutes theft.

**Recommendations:**

*   **For Prosecution**:  Reconsider and appeal or motion for reconsideration as the facts presented are sufficient to establish a crime of Robbery.
*   **For Defense:** Carefully analyze the application of *People v. Concepcion* and whether further mitigation of the penalty is possible given the circumstances.
