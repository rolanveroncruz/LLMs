## Legal Document Summary: Yaneza v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 149322 (2008)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition assailing the Court of Appeals' denial of a Motion for Extension of Time to file a Petition for Review. Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled on the merits of the underlying dispute.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Property Dispute:** Petitioner (Yaneza) owns Lot 2730-A. Respondents (De Jesus and Manzano) own adjacent Lot 2732, which requires access through Petitioner's property.
*   **Deed of Absolute Sale (Original):** Signed Oct 20, 1995.  Petitioner sold a 175 sq m portion of Lot 2730-A for P20,000 to Respondents for use as a 5-meter wide right of way. Clause 4 grants petitioner a perpetual right of way over the same portion. Terms include grantee to pay for realty taxes, subdivision and title transfer costs.
*   **Dispute and Complaint:** Petitioner sought to cancel the Deed of Sale due to alleged breaches (wider road, non-compliance with unspecified "Deed of Undertaking", dumping materials). Filed complaint for Cancellation of Contract with MCTC.
*   **Respondents' Defense:** Argued they originally bought the disputed 280 sq m from a prior owner (Llagas) and only entered into the agreement to resolve the dispute. Argue they paid an *additional* P40,000 for a larger 280 sq m area (evidenced by an Acknowledgment Receipt), effectively novating the original agreement.
*   **MCTC Decision:** Dismissed Petitioner's complaint and ordered Petitioner to execute a new Deed of Absolute Sale covering the larger 280 sq m, cancelled Petitioner's right of way, ordered removal of obstruction to access road, and awarded substantial damages to Respondents.
*   **RTC Decision:** Affirmed MCTC decision, but deleted the monetary award for damages.
*   **CA Decision:** Denied Petitioner's Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review for being filed one day late, dismissing the appeal. SC affirmed.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Yaneza):** Obligated to execute a Deed of Sale for the 280 sq m right of way. Liable for removing obstructions (fence) from the access road. The court denied his claim for damages for what he stated to be breaches of the contract.
*   **Respondents (De Jesus and Manzano):** Obligated to the sale of the right of way over the larger area.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Specific Performance:** Petitioner may face difficulties and legal actions to compel the execution of the deed of sale.
*   **Continued Litigation:** Further disputes could arise regarding the exact boundaries, use, and maintenance of the right of way.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Governs Certiorari and Prohibition, the remedy sought by the Petitioner.
*   **Article 1191, Civil Code:** Basis for the complaint.
*   **Article 1357, Civil Code:** Compels a party to execute a proper document after a contract is perfected.
*   **Statute of Frauds (implied reference):** The court held that the statute of frauds doesn't affect validity if a contract has been consummated.
*   **Ditching v. Court of Appeals, 331 Phil. 665 (1996):** Case law cited regarding the mandatory nature of perfecting an appeal within the prescribed period.
*   **Velarde v. Court of Appeals, 413 Phil. 360 (2001):** Cited regarding the need for an existing obligation for rescission to be applicable.
*   **Cenido v. Apacionado, 376 Phil. 801 (1999):** Cited regarding the action to compel execution of a document for a perfected contract.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Deed of Undertaking:** Its existence and validity are disputed. Respondents deny signing it, making its terms unenforceable against them.
*   **Nature of the Agreement (Original):** The Petitioner originally saw the use of his land as a right of way as a contract of easement that could be cancelled for violations of the contract, while the respondents averred it to be a sale, which the Court later upheld.
*   **Right of Way Clause (Clause 4):** Granting the grantor a perpetual right of way over the same portion transferred by the Deed of Sale can be a point of contention and future dispute between parties. It could be read as the deed of sale was actually an easement since the clause is nonsensical in an actual sale agreement.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court found that the original contract was novated by a subsequent oral agreement for a larger area, supported by the Acknowledgment Receipt. The Court viewed it as a sale. A risk lies in interpreting clause 4 of the Deed of Sale, which grants the grantor a perpetual right of way on what he sold. A court can interpret it to be an actual easement, not a sale of land.
