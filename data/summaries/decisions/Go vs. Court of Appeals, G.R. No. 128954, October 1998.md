**Case:** *Azucena Go and Regena Gloria Siong vs. Court of Appeals and Star Group Resources and Development, Inc.*, G.R. No. 128954, October 8, 1998.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court ruled on the propriety of appealing an interlocutory order suspending ejectment proceedings and the applicability of suspending an ejectment case based on strong reasons of equity. The court held that while an appeal from an interlocutory order is generally prohibited, it may be treated as a petition for certiorari where the trial court abuses its discretion by indefinitely suspending summary proceedings (ejectment) and the existing rules do not provide an adequate remedy, creating a "procedural void." The court emphasized the purpose of summary procedure for expeditious case resolution. It also clarified that the exception allowing suspension of ejectment based on strong reasons of equity (Vda. de Legaspi) did not apply because resolution of the ejectment suit would not result in demolition of the premises.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Interlocutory Orders:** General rule against appealing interlocutory orders (as per Rules of Court).
*   **Summary Procedure:**  Section 36, Chapter III, BP Blg. 129 emphasizing expeditious resolution. Section 19 (g) prohibiting petitions for certiorari against interlocutory orders.
*   **Equitable Suspension of Ejectment:** *Vda. de Legaspi v. Avendano* and *Wilmon Auto Supply v. Court of Appeals*, discusses circumstances where ejectment can be suspended due to equitable reasons (seriously placing right of plaintiffs to recover the premises).
*   **Court Discretion:**  The Supreme Court reserves the power to suspend its own rules when justice requires it.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Dilatory Tactics:** The CA noted the petitioners' apparent dilatory tactics. Continued delays could result in sanctions.
*   **Misuse of Procedural Rules:** Over-reliance on technicalities to impede a swift resolution could attract judicial disfavor.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **B.P. Blg. 129, Section 36, Chapter III:** Purpose of summary procedure.
*   **Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, Section 19 (g):** Prohibiting certiorari for interlocutory orders.
*   **Rule 65 (Certiorari):**  Applied to the "appeal" to remedy the procedural void.
*   ***Vda. de Legaspi v. Avendano*, 79 SCRA 135 (1977):** Establishes the equitable exception for suspending ejectment.
*   ***Wilmon Auto Supply v. Court of Appeals*, 208 SCRA 108 (1992):** Clarifies and limits the *Vda. de Legaspi* exception.
*   **Constitution, Section 5, Article VIII:** Supreme Court's power to promulgate procedural rules.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Procedural Void":**  The existence and scope of this "procedural void" might be challenged in future cases.  The Court addressed it pro hac vice, but a more precise definition or formal amendment of the rules might be needed.
*   **"Strong Reasons of Equity":** The application of the *Vda. de Legaspi* exception remains fact-specific and open to interpretation. The degree to which ownership is "seriously placed in issue" is a potential point of contention.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Court navigated a tension between procedural rules designed for speed and the need to ensure a fair and just outcome. The decision hinges on the Court's inherent power to adapt its rules when necessary to prevent injustice. The case highlights the importance of avoiding dilatory tactics and prioritizing the expeditious resolution of ejectment proceedings.  Future disputes may arise regarding the precise circumstances that justify treating an appeal as a petition for certiorari in similar contexts.
