**Case Summary: G.R. Nos. 150768 & 160176 (Heirs of Manguiat vs. CA & J.A. Development Corp.; Heirs of Manguiat vs. CA & Republic)**

**Nature of Document:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari assailing Court of Appeals (CA) decisions that set aside a partial decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in a quieting of title case.

**Key Issue:** Validity of service of summons on Bureau of Telecommunications (BUTEL) and the propriety of a partial judgment against BUTEL while the case against other defendants (specifically J.A. Development Corporation (JDC)) remained pending.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petitions, affirming the CA decisions.  The RTC lacked jurisdiction over BUTEL because summons was improperly served on an employee (Cholito Anitola) instead of the Solicitor General (OSG), as required by Rule 14, Section 13 of the Rules of Court when the defendant is the Republic of the Philippines. Furthermore, the partial decision against BUTEL, the order, and the writ of execution were nullified.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 14, Section 13 (Rules of Court):** Mandates service of summons on the Solicitor General when the defendant is the Republic of the Philippines or its agencies like BUTEL. This is the foundational statutory reference.
*   **Rule 9, Section 3(c) (Rules of Court):** Regarding partial default. If some, but not all, defendants in a claim alleging a common cause of action fail to answer, the court must try the case against *all* defendants based on the answers filed. The answer filed by a defendant inures to the benefit of all the defendants, defaulted or not.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** The RTC's failure to validly serve summons on BUTEL deprived it of jurisdiction. Any judgment rendered without jurisdiction is null and void. *Laus v. Court of Appeals* is cited to illustrate this.
*   **Prejudgment:** The partial decision against BUTEL constituted a prejudgment of the entire case, specifically regarding JDC's claim of ownership over the subject property.
*   **Due Process Violation:** The procedure adopted by the trial court deprived BUTEL of due process by denying them the benefit of the answer and evidence that could have been presented by JDC.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 14, Section 13 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Service upon public corporations.
*   **Rule 9, Section 3(c) of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Effect of partial default.
*   **E.O. No. 546:**  Establishes the Bureau of Telecommunications.
*   **Laus v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 101256, March 8, 1993, 219 SCRA 688, 705:** Cited regarding the requirement of due process and proper service of summons.
*   **Venturanza v. Court of Appeals, No. L-77760, December 11, 1987, 156 SCRA 305, 313:** Cited for the disputable presumption that an official duty has been regularly performed will not apply where it is patent from the sheriff's or server's return that it is defective.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Validity of Service:** Petitioners argued that the sheriff's return stating "duly served" should suffice. The SC rejected this, requiring strict compliance with Rule 14, Section 13 and proof of the recipient's authority to receive summons for the government entity.
*   **Severability of Claims:** Petitioners claimed that the causes of action against BUTEL, JDC, et al. were distinct and severable.  The SC sided with JDC, holding that the origin of their titles and their relationship to the subject property made their interests inseparable.

**Overall Risk:**

The petitioners face a significant risk of losing their claim because of the procedural errors in serving summons and the improper rendering of the partial decision. The case needs to be re-litigated with proper service on the Solicitor General and adherence to Rule 9, Section 3(c) regarding co-defendants.
