## Legal Document Summary: *Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Teresita Panlilio Luciano* (G.R. No. 165428)

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review on certiorari regarding a dispute over the just compensation for two parcels of agricultural land acquired by the government under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL), RA 6657. The Supreme Court (SC) reverses the Court of Appeals (CA) decision and remands the case to the CA to receive evidence and determine the just compensation due to the landowner.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 6657 (CARL):** Governs the acquisition of the land and the determination of just compensation.
*   **Section 17, RA 6657:** Specifies factors to be considered in determining just compensation (cost of acquisition, current value, nature, use, income, owner's valuation, tax declarations, government assessments, social and economic benefits). These factors must be presented as factual matters to the Court, to provide enough context for determining fair value for the land.
*   **DAR AO No. 6, series of 1992, as amended by DAR AO No. 11, series of 1994:** Translates Section 17 factors into a basic formula for land valuation. This will be the formula the CA will use in receiving evidence and determining just compensation due.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP):**  Initially responsible for determining land value under EO No. 405. However, this is merely an initial determination, not conclusive. LBP is responsible for gathering facts, presenting evidence, and substantiating their valuations during court hearings.
*   **Special Agrarian Court (SAC) / CA (pro hac vice):**  Has the ultimate authority to determine just compensation based on evidence presented, Section 17 factors, and applicable DAR regulations.

**Liabilities:**

*   **LBP:**  Liable to pay just compensation to the landowner, Teresita Panlilio Luciano, for the acquired lands.
*   **Government:** Ultimately responsible for providing just compensation for expropriated land under CARP.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Valuation Discrepancies:**  The primary conflict revolves around the method of determining just compensation. The landowner contests the LBP's valuation based on DAR AO No. 6 and seeks a higher valuation, potentially based on earlier laws like PD No. 27, or market rates.
*   **Factual Disputes:** Determining the *factual values* of the Section 17 factors is critical. These include:
    * The average gross production per hectare that will affect the capitalized net income.
    * The comparable prices for land sales in the area.
    * Market value per tax declaration
*   **Timeliness:**  The age of the landowner and the lengthy delay since the land acquisition (1991) are noted as factors justifying accelerated resolution. Further delays could lead to legal challenges based on equity and fairness.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law)**
*   **EO No. 405 (Land Valuation Authority of LBP)**
*   **Section 17, RA 6657 (Factors for determining Just Compensation)**
*   **DAR AO No. 6, series of 1992 (Formula for Land Valuation under RA 6657)**, as amended by **DAR AO No. 11, series of 1994**.
*   **PD No. 27 (Tenants Emancipation Decree):** Has only suppletory effect under RA 6657.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Banal*** **(478 Phil. 701 (2004)):** Emphasized the factors of Section 17, that they require the party to present their respective evidence.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Gallego*** **(G.R. No. 173226, January 20, 2009, 576 SCRA 680):** Cited as precedent for remanding cases to the CA for evidence reception.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Natividad*** **(G.R. No. 127198, May 16, 2005, 458 SCRA 441):** Ruling that determination of just compensation must be in accordance with RA No. 6657, as opposed to PD No. 27 and EO No. 228.

**Conclusion:**

The SC's decision prioritizes the proper application of RA 6657 and relevant DAR regulations in determining just compensation. The remand to the CA is to ensure that both parties have the opportunity to present evidence and that the valuation is based on a comprehensive assessment of the factors outlined in Section 17. Quick action is needed due to the advanced age of the landowner.
