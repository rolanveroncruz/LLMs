### Legal Document Summary: People v. Judge Estrada and Lanuza (G.R. No. 124461)

**Nature:** Petition for review of a trial court order quashing a search warrant.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Central Issue:** Validity of Search Warrant No. 958 (95) issued against Aiden Lanuza for violation of RA 7394 (Consumer Act), specifically selling drugs without a license.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** The RTC quashed the warrant, declaring the seized articles inadmissible.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** The Supreme Court **affirmed** the RTC decision to quash the search warrant, but on different grounds than the clerical error noted by the Trial Court. Although the SC considered the clerical error related to Belen Cabanero as negligible, it determined the search warrant was invalid due to lack of probable cause and improper particularity in describing the place to be searched. The temporary restraining order previously issued was lifted.
*   **Probable Cause Issue:** The BFAD's application lacked sufficient probable cause because it did not present the best evidence readily procurable to prove Lanuza lacked a license to sell drugs. The SC noted that a certification from the Department of Health would have been easily obtainable but was not provided.
*   **Particularity of Description Issue:** The search warrant's description of the place to be searched (516 San Jose de la Montana St., Mabolo, Cebu City) was deemed too general. It failed to distinguish Lanuza's residence at Lot No. 41 from other structures (Lot No. 38) within the same compound, especially considering the existence of a sketch illustrating the different buildings.
*   **Illegal Implementation:** The searching team exceeded the scope of the warrant by searching the warehouse of Folk Arts Export & Import Company (owned by a different person) after finding nothing in Lanuza's residence. The SC deemed the search of the warehouse as an unreasonable search and seizure.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   BFAD: Obligation to present sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for a search warrant, especially when the issue is the absence of a license. The BFAD was ordered to return the seized items.
*   Searching Team: Duty to execute search warrants within their defined scope. The team's actions in searching the warehouse exceeded their authority.
*   Aiden Lanuza: While not subject to the search warrant due to its invalidity, the case highlights the potential for prosecution under RA 7394 for unlicensed sale of drugs if a valid warrant were to be executed.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Evidence obtained through the invalid search warrant is inadmissible, hindering any potential prosecution of Lanuza based on the seized drugs.
*   Potential liability for illegal search and seizure against members of the searching team for exceeding the scope of the warrant.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article III, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution:** Requirements for a valid search warrant (probable cause, particularity).
*   **Republic Act No. 7394 (Consumer Act of the Philippines), Articles 40(k) and 41:** Violation for selling drugs without a license and penalties.

*   **Villanueva vs. Querubin, 48 SCRA 345, 350**
*   **Mata vs. Bayona, 128 SCRA 388, 393-394 [1984]; Nolasco vs. Puno, 139 SCRA 155, 166.**
*   **20th Century Fox Film Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, et. al., 164 SCRA 655, 663-664 [1988].**
*   **People vs. Veloso, 48 Phil. 169, 182 [1925].**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application's conflicting statements (referring to both Lanuza and Cabanero) initially led the trial court to quash the warrant. While the Supreme Court deemed this a "negligible defect," it highlights the importance of accuracy and clarity in warrant applications.
