## Legal Document Summary: Blay v. Baña, G.R. No. 232189 (2018)

This case involves a petition for review on certiorari regarding the dismissal of a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage (under Article 36 of the Family Code) and the subsequent handling of the respondent's counterclaim.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Rule 17, Section 2 of the Rules of Court:** This is the central provision. It governs the dismissal of a complaint upon the plaintiff's motion and addresses the handling of counterclaims.
    *   Specifically, the case revolves around the interpretation of the 2nd and 3rd sentences of the rule. The 2nd stating dismissal is limited to the complaint if a counterclaim has been pleaded before the service of the motion to dismiss. The 3rd sentence giving the defendant 15 days to file a manifestation of a preference to have the counterclaim resolved in the same action.

**Obligations:**

*   **Defendant's Obligation:** Under Rule 17, Section 2, if the defendant (respondent Baña) wishes to prosecute their counterclaim in the same action after the plaintiff (petitioner Blay) moves to dismiss, they MUST manifest this preference within 15 days of receiving notice of the motion to dismiss. Failure to do so forfeits the right to pursue the counterclaim in the same action.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Respondent's Risk:** By failing to file a timely manifestation, the respondent risks having to refile her counterclaim as a separate action, potentially incurring additional costs and facing statute of limitations issues (if applicable).
*   **Petitioner's Potential Risk:** The petitioner faced the risk of having the counterclaim litigated in the same action, potentially prolonging legal proceedings and increasing legal expenses.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 36 of the Family Code:** Basis of the initial Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage.
*   **Rule 17, Section 2 of the Rules of Court:** Critically important. The Supreme Court held that the CA erred in selectively applying the rule, ignoring the 15-day manifestation requirement.
*   **Chavez v. Judicial and Bar Council, 691 Phil. 173, 200-201 (2012).** Used by the Court as persuasive authority as to how the whole and every part of the statute must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts and in order to produce a harmonious whole.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary ambiguity centered on the interpretation of Rule 17, Section 2. The CA interpreted it to mean that the counterclaim automatically survives the dismissal of the complaint. The Supreme Court, however, clarified that while the counterclaim is *not* automatically dismissed, the defendant *must* still timely manifest their intention to pursue it in the same action, or else pursue it as a separate action.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court **reversed** the CA decision and granted the petitioner's motion to withdraw the petition for nullity of marriage. The dismissal was without prejudice to the respondent's right to prosecute her counterclaim, but only in a separate action, due to her failure to timely manifest her intention to prosecute it in the same action.
