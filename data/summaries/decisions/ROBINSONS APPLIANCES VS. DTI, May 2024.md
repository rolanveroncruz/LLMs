## Legal Document Summary: Robinsons Appliances Corp. v. DTI

**Case:** *Robinsons Appliances Corporation (Robinsons Forum) v. Hon. Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry, et al.* (G.R. No. 264196, May 28, 2024)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision which dismissed Robinsons Appliances' Petition for Certiorari against the DTI's ruling that found it liable for violating Sections 6.1.1 and 6.2.1 of DAO No. 2-2007 for selling Hanabishi flat irons with PS Mark but without the required PS License Number.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **DAO No. 2-2007, Sections 6.1.1 & 6.2.1:** Prohibits the sale of products covered by Philippine Standard Certification Mark Schemes which do not conform to applicable PNS quality/safety standards or lack required BPS identification/markings. Retailers, including Robinsons Appliances, are explicitly covered.
*   **DAO No. 4-2008, Section 4 (and IRR):** Requires the affixation of the PS Quality and/or Safety Certification Mark *and* the PS Certification Mark License Number (per IRR) on products covered by mandatory certification.
*   **RA 4109:** Provides for the standardization and/or inspection of products.
*   **Retailers' Obligation:** Retailers are obliged to sell products that comply with PNS and bear the required PS Mark or valid Import Commodity Clearance (ICC).

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Violation:** Selling covered products without the required PS License Number.
*   **Penalties (DAO No. 2-2007, Section 10):** Fine (PHP 25,000.00) and forfeiture of non-compliant products.
*   **Retailer Liability:** Retailers are held liable. Reliance on supplier warranty is not a valid defense.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 4109:** Standards Law
*   **RA 7394 (Consumer Act of the Philippines):** Empowered DTI to establish quality and safety standards.
*   **EO 292 (Administrative Code of 1987), Chapter 1, Section 3, Title X** confers DTI's power to formulate regulations.
*   **EO 913, Article II, Section 2:** Empowers the Secretary of Trade and Industry to promulgate rules implementing trade and industry laws.
*   **Rule 43, Rules of Court:** Applicable for appealing quasi-judicial agency decisions to the CA. *Robinsons Appliances incorrectly filed Rule 65 petition for certiorari.*
*   ***Abakada Gura Party List v. Purisima*** **(584 Phil. 246 (2008)):**  Affirms that administrative regulations have the force and effect of law.
*   ***Carpio-Morales v. Court of Appeals*** **(772 Phil. 672 (2015)):** Explains the extraordinary circumstances where a Rule 65 petition is proper despite the existence of a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, which were not applicable in the case.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of IRR of DAO No. 4-2008:** The requirement for the license number to be included in the PS Mark is found only in the IRR, not the DAO itself.  Robinsons Appliances might attempt to challenge the IRR's validity by arguing it expands upon the underlying DAO.  However, the Court asserts that the IRR, adopted under proper authority, also has the force and effect of law and cannot be collaterally attacked.
*   **Retailer vs. Manufacturer Liability:**  Robinsons Appliances argued they were merely retailers and should not be held liable for the manufacturer's non-compliance. The court rejects this based on the explicit mention of "retailers" in the governing regulations. This raises concerns about the due diligence burden on retailers.
*   **Procedural Issue:** The CA rightly ruled that the correct remedy was a Petition for Review under Rule 43, filed within 15 days. By filing a Petition for Certiorari instead, and doing so belatedly, Robinsons Appliances failed to properly preserve its right to appeal.
*   **Interpretation of DTI Regulations:** The Court gives deference to the DTI's interpretation of its own rules, creating a high bar for challenging DTI enforcement actions.

**Ambiguities:** The document is rather comprehensive and does not present substantial ambiguities. The primary contention revolves around whether the specific regulation (the IRR requiring the license number) was validly promulgated and whether the retailer should be liable for what Robinsons Appliances claimed to be the manufacturer's failure to include the license number on the flat iron. The Court resolves these points in favor of the DTI.
