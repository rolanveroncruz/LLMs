## Legal Document Summary: Lim v. People, G.R. No. 226590

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision reversing the CA and RTC convictions of Petitioners for falsification of a public document.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioners:** Shirley T. Lim, Mary T. Lim-Leon, and Jimmy T. Lim (Officers of Pentel Merchandising Co., Inc.)
*   **Respondent:** People of the Philippines
*   **Complainant:** Lucy Lim

**Key Issue:** Prescription of the crime of falsification of a public document.

**Factual Background:** Petitioners were convicted for falsifying a Secretary's Certificate and Board Resolution No. 2000-001, making it appear that their deceased father, Quintin Lim, participated in a board meeting and approved the disposal of a Pentel property. The falsified documents allowed Jimmy Lim to sell the property to Spouses Lee.

**Legal Analysis and Holding:**

*   **Crime Charged:** Falsification of a public document, specifically the Secretary's Certificate, under Article 172(1) in relation to Article 171(4) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The Supreme Court agreed with lower courts on the charge being falsification of a *public* document, not a private one as the Petitioners argued.
*   **Elements of Falsification Proven:** The Court found that the elements of falsification were present, specifically making untruthful statements in a narration of facts (Quintin being present and approving the resolution when he was deceased).
*   **Prescription of the Offense:** Despite upholding the factual finding of falsification, the Court *reversed* the conviction based on prescription. While the defense was raised for the first time on appeal, the Court held that prescription of a crime can be raised at any stage of the proceedings. Citing *People v. Castro*, 95 Phil. 462 (1954), and *Syhunliong v. Rivera*, 735 Phil. 349 (2014).
*   **Commencement of Prescriptive Period:** The Court held that the prescriptive period began on *March 29, 2000*, the date the falsified Secretary's Certificate and Deed of Absolute Sale were *registered* with the Register of Deeds, based on the constructive notice doctrine. The court found that this constructive notice, derived from Section 52 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), included not just the sale but also the Secretary's Certificate showing Jimmy's authority to act for Pentel. Citing *People v. Reyes*, 256 Phil. 1015 (1989), and *People v. Hon. Villalon*, 270 Phil. 637 (1990). The Court reasoned that without the Secretary's Certificate, the registration of the transfer would have been invalid.
*   **Application of Article 91 of the RPC:**  Because the penalty for falsification under Article 172 falls under correctional penalties, the prescriptive period is 10 years (Article 90 of the RPC). The complaint was filed more than 10 years after March 29, 2000.
*   **Interruption of Prescription:** The Court acknowledges that filing a complaint with the fiscal's office interrupts the prescriptive period, per *Francisco, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.*, 207 Phil. 471 (1983). However, since the exact date of that filing was not available in the record, the Court had to assume it was no earlier than the date on the Affidavit of Complaint (September 21, 2010) which would still be beyond the prescriptive period.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Novel Application of Constructive Notice:** The decision extends the constructive notice doctrine to a *supporting document* (the Secretary's Certificate), not just the main transaction (the Deed of Absolute Sale). This potentially expands the scope of constructive notice in future falsification cases involving registered documents.
*   **Impact on Due Diligence:** This decision could impact the due diligence required in real estate transactions. Buyers will need to be more diligent in verifying not only the title but also the validity of any supporting corporate documents authorizing the sale.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court's decision highlights the importance of the statute of limitations. While the Court found evidence of falsification, the passage of time and the application of the constructive notice doctrine resulted in the dismissal of the case.
