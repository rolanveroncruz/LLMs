**Case Summary: Republic v. Jabson, G.R. No. 200223, June 6, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's grant of an application for land registration filed by the Jabsons.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Jabsons sufficiently established the requirements for land registration under the Public Land Act and Presidential Decree No. 1529, particularly the alienable and disposable nature of the land and continuous possession since June 12, 1945.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals, dismissing the Jabsons' application without prejudice, holding that they failed to prove that the land was alienable and disposable public land.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Sec. 48(b) of the Public Land Act and Sec. 14(1) of PD 1529:** Establishes the requirements for judicial confirmation of imperfect titles, including open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The applicant bears the burden to prove that the land is alienable and disposable, and that their possession meets the statutory requirements.
*   **Regalian Doctrine:** The State owns all lands of the public domain.
*   **Requirement of Positive Act:** Alienable and disposable nature must be proven by a positive act of government (e.g., presidential proclamation, executive order, legislative act, or a statute).

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to Prove Alienability:** Results in denial of the application, as the presumption is that the land remains part of the public domain. *Republic v. Jaralve, 698 Phil. 86 (2012)*
*   **Insufficient Evidence:** Reliance on unauthenticated documents, photocopies, or documents not formally offered in evidence can lead to dismissal. *Gaerlan v. Republic, 729 Phil. 418 (2014)*
*   **Unauthorized Certification:** Certifications issued by officials without proper authority (e.g., DENR Senior Forest Management Specialist) are not sufficient proof. *Republic v. T.A.N. Properties, Inc., 578 Phil. 441 (2008)*
*   **Belated Submission of Evidence:** Evidence submitted for the first time on appeal may be rejected, especially if it was procured as an afterthought and not presented during trial. *Republic v. Castro, 594 Phil. 124 (2008)*.
*   **Dual Property Issue:** The certification of one parcel of land does not guarantee or assume the other properties are also considered alienable and disposable.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Llanes v. Republic, 592 Phil. 623 (2008):***  This case (cited by the appellate court) allows admission of a *corrected* CENRO Certification not formally offered during trial, under certain circumstances.  However, the Supreme Court distinguished it, stating that *Llanes* involved a corrected certification *already* presented in unedited form during trial, not a wholly new document.
*   ***Republic v. T.A.N. Properties, Inc., 578 Phil. 441 (2008):*** Emphasizes that applicant must establish that the DENR Secretary had approved the land's classification as alienable and disposable.
*   ***Republic v. Castro, 594 Phil. 124 (2008):*** Documents not identified and presented during proceedings in the trial court cannot be submitted for the first time on appeal.
*   ***Republic v. Jaralve, 698 Phil. 86 (2012):*** States that applicant must clearly prove the existence of a positive act to prove alienability.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The applicability of *Llanes* is a contentious point, as the Court distinguished it based on the nature of the belatedly submitted evidence. The appellate court's reliance on *Llanes* was deemed erroneous.
*   The sufficiency of a DENR certification, without supporting documentation showing the DENR Secretary's approval, is a point of contention. The Court clarified that the certification alone is insufficient.

**Statutory References:**

*   Commonwealth Act No. 141 (The Public Land Act)
*   Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree)
*   Presidential Decree No. 705 (Revised Forestry Code of the Philippines)

**Conclusion:**

The Jabsons' application was deficient due to the failure to present sufficient and timely evidence to prove that both parcels of land were alienable and disposable as of June 12, 1945, or earlier. The belated submission of an unauthenticated DENR certification, and the lack of supporting evidence demonstrating the DENR Secretary's approval of the land classification, were fatal to their case.
