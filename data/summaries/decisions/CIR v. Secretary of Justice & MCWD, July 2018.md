## Legal Document Summary: CIR v. Secretary of Justice and MCWD (G.R. No. 209289)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA dismissal of a Petition for Certiorari)

**Subject Matter:** Jurisdiction over a tax dispute between the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) and Metropolitan Cebu Water District (MCWD), a government-owned or controlled corporation (GOCC).

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Jurisdiction of the Secretary of Justice (SOJ):** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision that the SOJ has jurisdiction to decide the tax dispute between the CIR and MCWD. This jurisdiction is based on P.D. No. 242 (now Chapter 14, Book IV of Executive Order No. 292, the Administrative Code of 1987), specifically Sections 66 and 67, which mandate administrative settlement of disputes solely between government entities, including GOCCs, involving questions of law, by the SOJ. This position is supported by *Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. 198146, August 8, 2017*.
*   **Application of P.D. No. 242 (EO 292):** The Court emphasized the mandatory nature of P.D. No. 242, requiring administrative settlement before resorting to courts.  The purpose is to provide a speedy and efficient means of dispute resolution between government entities and prevent the clogging of court dockets.
*   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** The CIR failed to exhaust administrative remedies.  Since the tax deficiency exceeds PHP 1,000,000, the CIR was required to appeal the SOJ's decision to the Office of the President (OP) before seeking judicial intervention. Failure to do so rendered the Petition for Certiorari premature, establishing lack of cause of action. Case reference: *Samar II Electric Cooperative Inc. (SAMELCO), et al. v. Seludo, Jr., 686 Phil. 786 (2012).*
*   **Propriety of Certiorari:** The Supreme Court noted that certiorari is not an appropriate remedy when an appeal to the OP is available.

**Obligations:**

*   GOCCs and Government agencies are obligated to follow the prescribed administrative process for settling disputes as outlined in P.D. No. 242 (EO 292).
*   CIR has an obligation to appeal to the Office of the President before court when the amount of the claim exceeds 1M

**Liabilities/Exemptions determined by SOJ:**

*   MCWD is exempt from income tax under Section 32(B)(7)(b) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997.
*   MCWD is liable for franchise tax of two percent (2%) of its gross receipts.
*   MCWD is exempt from value-added tax.
*   MCWD is not liable to pay surcharge, interest, and compromise penalty on the deficiency taxes.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Reversal by Office of the President:** While the SC upheld the SOJ's jurisdiction, the possibility exists that the OP could reverse the SOJ's decision if an appeal had been properly lodged by the CIR.
*   **Future Tax Assessments:** The ruling clarifies MCWD's tax status regarding the specific assessment. However, future tax assessments may lead to further disputes, requiring similar administrative processes.
*   **Application to Other GOCCs:** This case reinforces the applicability of P.D. 242/EO 292 to disputes involving all GOCCs and government agencies, clarifying the proper venue for resolving such conflicts.

**Key Case Law:**

*   *Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. 198146, August 8, 2017* (Jurisdiction of DOJ in tax disputes between government entities)
*   *Samar II Electric Cooperative Inc. (SAMELCO), et al. v. Seludo, Jr., 686 Phil. 786 (2012)* (Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies)

*   Presidential Decree No. 242
*   Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987), Chapter 14, Book IV, Sections 66, 67, 68, and 70
