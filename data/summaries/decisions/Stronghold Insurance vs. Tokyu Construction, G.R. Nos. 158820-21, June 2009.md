## Legal Document Summary - *Stronghold Insurance Company, Incorporated vs. Tokyu Construction Company, Ltd.* (G.R. Nos. 158820-21, June 05, 2009)

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA decision that held Stronghold Insurance Company, Inc. (Stronghold) liable on its surety and performance bonds issued in favor of Tokyu Construction Company, Ltd. (Tokyu) in relation to a subcontract agreement between Tokyu and G.A. Gabriel Enterprises (Gabriel) for the construction of the NAIA Terminal 2's Storm Drainage System (SDS) and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subcontract Agreement:** Tokyu (prime contractor) contracted with Gabriel for SDS and STP construction.
*   **Bonds:** Stronghold issued surety and performance bonds to guarantee Gabriel's performance and repayment of advance payments. Gabriel defaulted.
*   **Revision of Scope:** The scope of work and contract price was revised *after* Gabriel had already defaulted. Tico Insurance Company, Inc. (Tico) later issued replacement bonds.
*   **Termination:** Tokyu terminated the agreement due to Gabriel's abandonment.
*   **CIAC Arbitration:** Tokyu filed a complaint with the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) against Gabriel, Tico, and Stronghold.
*   **CIAC Decision:** CIAC ruled Gabriel liable for cost overruns, liquidated damages, and unrecouped down payment. Stronghold was held jointly and severally liable with Gabriel *only* for the unrecouped down payment under its surety bonds, up to the amount of P6,701,063.60. The claim against Stronghold on the performance bonds was dismissed.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA modified the CIAC decision, holding Stronghold liable under both surety and performance bonds for cost overruns, liquidated damages, and unrecouped down payments, but limited Tico's liability for liquidated damages.
*   **Supreme Court (SC) Ruling:** SC affirmed the CA's decision with modification. Stronghold is held liable for cost overruns and liquidated damages accruing during the effectivity of its bonds, the CA Decision STANDS.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Stronghold:** Solidarily liable with Gabriel for cost overruns, liquidated damages, and unrecouped downpayments, BUT only for the cost overrun and liquidated damages accruing during the effectivity of the bonds.
*   **Gabriel:** Primarily liable for cost overruns, liquidated damages, and unrecouped down payments.
*   **Tokyu:** Obligated to pay Gabriel the amount of P2,197,624.19 from the counterclaims

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Expiration of Bonds:** The Supreme Court limits Stronghold's liability to the period of effectivity of the original bonds. A potential risk is determining the precise amount of damages accruing during this period.
*   **Validity of Bonds without principal contract:** Stronghold contends that the principal contract did not exist when the Bonds were issues, but did not bring the misrepresentation claim to trial court.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **E.O. 1008 (Construction Industry Arbitration Law):** Affirms CIAC's jurisdiction over construction disputes. Section 4 dictates that the CIAC has exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from or in connection with contracts entered into by parties involved in construction.
*   **Civil Code Art. 1217:** Joint and solidary obligations (impacts how liability may be determined).
*   **Insurance Code:** Differentiates between guarantee (Civil Code) and surety (Insurance Code) as different legal effects and significance.
*   **Principles of Suretyship:** The SC reiterated that the surety's liability is direct, primary, and absolute, but limited to the terms of the bond. Intra-Strata Assurance Corporation v. Republic, G.R. No. 156571, July 9, 2008
*   **Novation:** The SC ruled that the modification of the subcontract agreement did *not* release Stronghold from its obligations as surety because it did not make the obligations of both the principal and surety more onerous. Intra-Strata Assurance Corporation v. Republic, G.R. No. 156571, July 9, 2008

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Accrual of Damages:** Determining the precise dates damages accrued to align with the bond's validity period is crucial and may be contentious.
