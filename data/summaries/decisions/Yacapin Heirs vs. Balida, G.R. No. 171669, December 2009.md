**Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 171669**

**Case:** *Heirs of Rodrigo Yacapin v. Felimon Balida*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Date:** December 14, 2009

**Nature of Document:**  Decision denying a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a Petition for Annulment of Judgment.

**Background:** This case involves a dispute over three parcels of land.  Respondents (Balida Heirs) filed an action for partition, annulment of titles, and damages in 1991, claiming heirship to Valentina Yacapin, one of the original registered owners of the subject properties.  Petitioners (Yacapin Heirs) also filed a similar action. The RTC consolidated the cases and ruled in favor of the Respondents, recognizing them as Valentinaâ€™s heirs and ordering the partition of the land. Petitioners initially appealed but withdrew the appeal and sought a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, which was denied.  A writ of execution was issued.  Years later, Petitioners filed a Petition for Annulment of Judgment in the Court of Appeals, alleging extrinsic fraud (falsified death certificate).

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **RTC Decision (Dec. 5, 1993):**  Recognized Respondents as heirs of Valentina Yacapin, nullified existing titles, and ordered partition of subject lots. This is the judgment Petitioners sought to annul.
*   **Petitioners' Claim of Extrinsic Fraud:**  Petitioners argued that the RTC decision was procured through extrinsic fraud, specifically, collusion between the judge and Respondents in admitting a falsified death certificate of Valentina Yacapin.
*   **Respondents' Defense:** Essentially defended the validity of the RTC decision and the dismissal of the various actions brought by Petitioners.
*   **Applicable Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 47:** Petition for Annulment of Judgment is available only when a party is precluded from filing a motion for new trial, an appeal or a petition for relief without fault on his part. Moreover, such petition will only be allowed in the presence of either extrinsic fraud or lack of jurisdiction.

**Supreme Court Holding & Reasoning:**

*   **Denial of Petition:** The Supreme Court denied the Petition for Review, upholding the Court of Appeals' dismissal of the Petition for Annulment of Judgment.
*   **Improper Recourse:**  The Court held that recourse to a petition for annulment of judgment is improper if petitioner lost the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal or petition for relief due to a cause attributable to petitioner himself. Nor can it be resorted to if petitioner has previously availed of any of the aforementioned remedies.
*   **Failure to Establish Grounds:** The court found that the Petitioners failed to establish any grounds for a petition for annulment of judgment.
*   **Delay Tactic:**  The Court viewed the Petition for Annulment of Judgment as an attempt to unduly delay the execution of the RTC decision.
*   **Treble Costs:** The Court imposed treble costs, solidarily, against Petitioners and their counsel, Atty. Emelie P. Bangot, Jr., for a frivolous appeal, motion for new trial and this petition for annulment of judgment.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:**  Obligated to comply with the RTC decision ordering partition. Liable for treble costs.
*   **Petitioners' Counsel:** Jointly and severally liable with petitioners for the treble costs.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Jurisdiction Claim (Implicit):** While the Petition primarily argued extrinsic fraud, there may be an underlying argument, although insufficiently pleaded, regarding the RTC's jurisdiction if the death certificate was indeed falsified, potentially impacting the determination of proper heirs. However, this argument was not successfully developed by the Petitioners.
*   **Extrinsic Fraud Burden of Proof:** Demonstrating extrinsic fraud is a high burden. The Court found the Petitioners' evidence lacking.
*   **Res Judicata/Law of the Case:** The withdrawal of the initial appeal likely had a strong influence on the subsequent dismissal of the Petition for Annulment, as the findings of fact from the RTC were deemed conclusive due to the withdrawal.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 47 of the Rules of Court:** Governing Annulment of Judgments.
*   **Sec. 1, Rule 47 of the Rules of Court:**  Availability of Petition for Annulment of Judgment.
*   **Sec. 2, Rule 47 of the Rules of Court:** Grounds for Annulment of Judgment.

**Analysis for Legal Counsel:**

This case illustrates the strict requirements for availing of a Petition for Annulment of Judgment. The Petitioners faced an uphill battle due to their prior withdrawal of appeal and the fact that they had already pursued other remedies. The Court emphasized the importance of finality of judgment. The imposition of treble costs on both the Petitioners and their counsel should serve as a cautionary tale against pursuing frivolous litigation for the purpose of delay. The key takeaway is the importance of diligently pursuing available remedies in a timely fashion and the high burden of proving extrinsic fraud.
