## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-06-2016 (FORMERLY OCA I.P.I. NO. 04-2120-RTJ)

**Case:** Corazon R. Tanjuatco vs. Judge Ireneo L. Gako, Jr.

**Nature:** Administrative case against a retired RTC Judge for Knowingly Rendering Unjust Judgment, Gross Partiality, and Gross Ignorance.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Dispute:** Contract rescission case (Civil Case No. CEB-27334) concerning a "Contract to Buy and Sell" land between Vicente S. del Rosario et al. and the City of Cebu. Land was intended for an abattoir project but the project was stopped after the 1986 EDSA Revolution.
*   **Complainant's Allegations:** Judge Gako:
    *   Instructed the plaintiff's counsel (Pantaleon) in the rescission case to amend the complaint, specifically regarding verification and relief sought (rentals), effectively "lawyering" for a party.
    *   Awarded the purchase price as rentals solely to Vicente B., despite knowledge that half the property belonged to the estate of the deceased Vicente S., already under the court's jurisdiction in a partition case (Civil Case No. CEB-17236) handled by the same judge initially.
    *   Allowed execution pending appeal while a motion for intervention by Carlos del Rosario (also an heir of the deceased Vicente S.) remained unresolved.
*   **Judge Gako's Defense:** Decision was based on law and evidence; not aware of the overlap between the partition case and rescission case property; Pantaleon could represent the other heirs; no damage to complainant as the case was on appeal; duty of court to guide litigants.
*   **Investigating Justice's Findings:** Guilty of knowingly rendering an unjust judgment and grave misconduct, primarily because the judge (1) proceeded without indispensable parties, (2) "lawyered" for the plaintiff, (3) denied the motion to intervene.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Judge Gako found **Guilty of Simple Misconduct**. The court rejected most of the Investigator's findings, holding that:
    *   Judge's suggestion to amend the complaint was an attempt to comply with pre-trial guidelines to ensure swift resolution and address defective verification by the attorney-in-fact. Original verification may have been sufficient, and even if defective, verification is a formal, not jurisdictional, requirement. *[Reference: Buenaventura v. Uy, et al., No. L-28156, March 31, 1982; Oshita v. Repubic, No. L-21180, March 31, 1967; Rule 7, Section 4 of the Rules of Court]*
    *   Judge acted within bounds in denying intervention filed after the decision was rendered. *[Reference: Rule 19, Section 2]*
    *   Pantaleon, as co-owner, could bring action without joining all other co-owners. *[Reference: 2 Tolentino, Civil Code of the Philippines 170]*

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Judge Gako was fined PhP 100,000, deducted from his retirement benefits.
*   Office of the Court Administrator ordered to process retirement papers.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The decision hinges on the interpretation of judicial discretion in guiding litigants, particularly during pre-trial. The line between proper guidance and improper partiality is crucial.
*   Co-owner representation: While a single co-owner *can* represent others, this can be risky if there are conflicting interests or if the unrepresented co-owners later dispute the representation.
*   Prior Infractions: The unusually high fine (compared to a usual 20,000.00 pesos) of 100,000 pesos was significantly based on Judge Gako's previous infractions/violations.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court (Rule 7, Sections 4 & 5; Rule 19, Section 2):** Procedure on Verification, Certification Against Forum Shopping, and Intervention.
*   **Civil Code (Tolentino):** Co-ownership rights.
*   **A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC:** Rule on Guidelines to be Observed by Trial Court Judges and Clerks of Courts in the Conduct of Pre-trial and Use of Deposition-Discovery Measures.
*   **Related cases cited in the decision (Lagcao v. Gako, Jr., Zamora v. Gako, Jr.):**  Demonstrate a pattern of prior infractions by the judge that influenced the penalty imposed.

**Overall Assessment:**

While Judge Gako was penalized, the Supreme Court significantly tempered the Investigating Justice's findings. The case highlights the challenges in balancing judicial efficiency with impartiality and the potential for administrative liability even when ultimate motives are not proven corrupt. The high fine serves as a cautionary tale of a judge whose prior bad acts informed the severity of the punishment meted out to him.
