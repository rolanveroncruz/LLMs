**Case Summary: Rural Bank of the Seven Lakes (S.P.C.), Inc. vs. Belen A. Dan (G.R. No. 174109)**

**Subject Matter:** This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by Rural Bank of the Seven Lakes (RBSL) seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals (CA) decision which reversed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) en banc's affirmation of the dismissal of Belen Dan's (Respondent) case (SEC Case No. 03-99-6229) for failure to prosecute.  The core issue revolves around the propriety of the dismissal due to forum shopping, lack of verification of appeal, and failure to prosecute.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Forum Shopping:**  The Supreme Court (SC) found that Dan engaged in forum shopping by simultaneously pursuing SEC Case No. 03-99-6229 (nullification of suspension/termination and damages) and Civil Case SP No. 5734-2000 (damages for wrongful termination) in the RTC. The elements of *litis pendentia* (identity of parties, rights asserted, and reliefs prayed for) and *res judicata* are met. The SC cited *Sps. Ong v. Court of Appeals*, 433 Phil. 490 (2002), to highlight the distinction between the act of forum shopping and the certification requirement.  Violation warrants summary dismissal per Rule 7, Section 5 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Lack of Verification:**  Dan's appeal to the SEC en banc lacked verification, a violation of Section 2, Rule III of the SEC Rules of Procedure. The SC rejected the CA's justification for relaxing this requirement, stating that procedural rules must be followed, and that non-compliance renders a pleading as unsigned.
*   **Failure to Prosecute:** Dan's repeated failure to attend scheduled hearings, or her counsel's failures without proper justification, led to the dismissal of the SEC case. The SC held that the SEC Hearing Officer acted appropriately.
*   **Client's Responsibility:** The SC reiterates the general rule that a client is bound by their counsel's conduct, negligence, and mistakes. The exception (gross negligence depriving client of due process) does not apply.  The SC notes Dan's own negligence in failing to monitor the case's progress.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 7353 (Rural Banks Act of 1992):** Dan was charged with violating Section 5.
*   **Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court:** Pertains to the certification against forum shopping and its consequences.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Guevara v. BPI Securities Corporation, G.R. No. 159786 (2006):**  Defines forum shopping.
*   **Saura v. Saura, Jr., 372 Phil. 337 (1999):** Elements of forum shopping.
*   **Sps. Ong v. Court of Appeals, 433 Phil. 490 (2002):** Distinction between forum shopping and certification against forum shopping.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Natividad, G.R. No. 127198 (2005):** Emphasizes the importance of adhering to procedural rules.
*   **Rivera v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 157824 (2005):** Symbiosis between form and substance
*   **Reliance Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. v. Amante, Jr., G.R. No. 150994 (2005):** Equitable relief should not be granted if due process was previously denied.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Sanctions for Forum Shopping:** Dismissal of the case with prejudice, direct contempt, and potential administrative sanctions against both the litigant and counsel.
*   **Loss of Substantive Rights:** The SC's strict adherence to procedural rules resulted in Dan losing her opportunity to have her claims adjudicated on their merits.
*   **Counsel's Liability:**  Potential malpractice claim against Dan's counsel for gross negligence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document does not outline any ambiguous or contentious clauses. The Court clearly sides with the Petitioner, RBSL, highlighting Respondent's procedural errors. The only potential contention could stem from the interpretation of what constitutes 'gross negligence' on the part of counsel.

**Conclusion:**

The SC reversed the CA decision, reinstating the SEC's dismissal of Dan's case. The ruling emphasizes strict adherence to procedural rules, particularly regarding forum shopping, verification, and diligent prosecution.  Dan's simultaneous pursuit of parallel actions and failure to comply with procedural requirements were deemed fatal to her case.  This case serves as a strong warning against forum shopping and highlights the importance of competent legal representation and client diligence.
