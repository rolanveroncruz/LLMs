Okay, here's a legal summary of the *People v. Go* case, as per your request:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Edgar S. Go*, G.R. No. 210816 & G.R. No. 210854, December 10, 2018.

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision dismissing the charge of reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide, serious physical injuries, and damage to property against Respondent Edgar S. Go. This arose from the sinking of the M/V Princess of the Stars.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Incident:** The M/V Princess of the Stars sank during Typhoon Frank in June 2008, resulting in numerous deaths and missing persons.
*   **Respondent's Role:** Edgar S. Go was the First Vice-President for Administration of Sulpicio Lines, Inc. (SLI) and team leader of the Crisis Management Committee. He was indicted for reckless imprudence based on his alleged failure to prevent the vessel's departure despite severe weather warnings and for failing to instruct the vessel to take shelter.
*   **BMI Findings:** The Board of Marine Inquiry (BMI) found SLI and its senior officers, including Go, negligent for failing to assess the danger of the typhoon and monitor the vessel effectively. The BMI also cited a failure to implement the Safety Quality Management Manual.
*   **DOJ Resolution:** The Department of Justice (DOJ) initially found probable cause to indict Go and the ship captain, Captain Marimon, for reckless imprudence under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The DOJ cited Go's role in decisions regarding vessel departures and his failure to cancel or discourage the voyage despite the typhoon. They referenced PCG Memorandum Circular 04-07.
*   **CA Ruling:** The CA reversed the DOJ, holding that Go's actions did not amount to criminal negligence. It stated that the decision to sail was within the captain's authority, in coordination with the PCG. The CA found no legal basis for Go's authority to direct the vessel at sea.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA, reinstating the criminal case against Go. The SC held that the DOJ Panel did not gravely abuse its discretion in finding probable cause.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent's Alleged Duty of Care:** The prosecution argued that Go, as a senior officer of SLI, had a duty to exercise extraordinary care and precaution to ensure the safety of passengers, including preventing the vessel's departure and instructing the vessel to take shelter.
*   **SLI's Obligations as a Common Carrier:** The SC cited Articles 1755, 1756, and 1759 of the Civil Code, outlining a common carrier's duty of utmost diligence to ensure passenger safety. A presumption of negligence arises in case of death or injury.
*   **Criminal Liability:** The SC differentiated between civil liability (breach of contract of carriage) and criminal liability (reckless imprudence under Article 365, RPC). Criminal liability hinges on establishing negligence beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Causation:** A key point is establishing a causal link between Go's actions (or omissions) and the sinking of the vessel. The defense argued the Captain was solely responsible.
*   **Scope of Authority:** The extent of Go's authority and responsibility for vessel operations is contentious. The prosecution argued he had the power to prevent the departure; the defense claimed he did not.
*   **Application of PCG MC 04-07:** The prosecution argues Go failed to comply with PCG MC 04-07. The defense may counter that this regulation primarily addresses the ship captain.
*   **Probable Cause vs. Guilt:** This ruling only pertains to the existence of probable cause, not a determination of Go's guilt.
*   **Non-Interference Doctrine:** The court acknowledged the policy of non-interference in the executive branch's determination of probable cause, unless there is grave abuse of discretion.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The decision references *First Women's Credit Corporation v. Hon. Perez* and *PCGG Chairman Elma v. Jacobi* regarding the policy of non-interference with prosecutorial discretion.
*   *People v. Dela Cerna*: True aggrieved party in a criminal prosecution is the People of the Philippines
*   *Commissioner Domingo v. Scheer*: Processes or pleadings should facilitate the application of justice to the rival claims of contending parties.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 365, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide, etc.
*   **Articles 1755, 1756, 1759, Civil Code:** Common carrier's duty of diligence.
*   **Section 5, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure**: all criminal actions are prosecuted under the direction and control of the public prosecutor.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The degree to which Go was responsible for the direct ship operations and his ability to enforce safety measures.
