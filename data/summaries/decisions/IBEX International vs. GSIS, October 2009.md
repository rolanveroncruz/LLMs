## Legal Document Summary: IBEX International, Inc. vs. GSIS

**Case:** IBEX International, Inc. vs. Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 162095, October 12, 2009.

**Nature:** Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court of the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the CIAC's dismissal of IBEX's complaint.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contract:** IBEX and GSIS entered into a contract on 23 February 1984, for IBEX to supply and install graphic signage for the GSIS Headquarters Building for P11,500,000, with a delivery date of 26 May 1986.
*   **Suspension:** GSIS suspended the project on 1 April 1986.
*   **Downpayment:** Disagreement exists on the amount of the downpayment – IBEX claims 10%, while GSIS alleges 15% (P1,725,000) as per the contract.
*   **Takeover:** GSIS took over the contract sometime in March 1994.
*   **CIAC Complaint:** IBEX filed a complaint with the CIAC on 28 December 1999, alleging breach of contract due to the unilateral takeover. Claimed damages were P13,941,664.38 plus interest and attorney's fees.
*   **CIAC Ruling:** The CIAC dismissed the complaint due to laches and extinctive prescription, finding the cause of action accrued upon the suspension of the contract in 1986.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** The Court of Appeals affirmed the CIAC's decision but disagreed on prescription, stating the running of the prescriptive period was interrupted by IBEX’s 24 March 1994 letter reminding GSIS of the existence of a valid contract. However, they upheld the CIAC's finding of incomplete project and thus, denied IBEX's claim for actual damages.
*   **Issue:** IBEX argues that the CA failed to consider that the take over of the contract was unjustified and constituted a breach of contract. As well as arguing that there was a completed project.

**Obligations:**

*   IBEX: Obligated to supply and install the graphic signage as per the contract. Failure to do so after reasonable time.
*   GSIS: Obligated to pay for the completed work.

**Liabilities:**

*   IBEX: Subject to potential liability for failure to complete the project.
*   GSIS: Originally accused of breach of contract by IBEX, but the claim was dismissed.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Factual Issues:** The Supreme Court highlights that IBEX is raising factual issues, which are generally not reviewable under Rule 45. The Supreme Court is not a trier of fact.
*   **Finality of CIAC Findings:** The CIAC's factual findings, particularly regarding project completion, are generally considered final and conclusive. This raises a high hurdle for IBEX to overcome.
*   **Exceptions to Finality:** IBEX must demonstrate one of the recognized exceptions to the finality of CIAC findings (e.g., corruption, fraud, grave abuse of discretion, findings contrary to the CA's findings, deprivation of due process) which it fails to do. *Uniwide Sales Realty and Resources Corporation v. Titan-Ikeda Construction and Development Corporation*

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on questions of law.
*   **Article 1155 of the Civil Code:** Addresses interruption of prescription, relied upon by the Court of Appeals.
*   ***Uniwide Sales Realty and Resources Corporation v. Titan-Ikeda Construction and Development Corporation***: Sets out the exceptions to the rule that the factual findings of construction arbitrators are final and conclusive and not reviewable by the Supreme Court on appeal.
*   ***David v. Construction Industry and Arbitration Commission***

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Downpayment Amount:** Discrepancy between IBEX and GSIS regarding the amount of the downpayment.
*   **Percentage of Completion:** Conflicting claims by IBEX regarding the percentage of project completion at the time of suspension.
*   **Justification for Takeover:** IBEX contends that the GSIS takeover was unjustified, while GSIS argues it was due to IBEX's failure to meet requirements.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition and affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision. It upheld the factual findings of the CIAC that the project was incomplete and deferred to the CIAC's expertise in construction disputes. The Court found that IBEX failed to demonstrate any recognized exceptions to the finality of CIAC findings. The primary risk for IBEX is the difficulty in overturning established factual findings and the limitations of review under Rule 45.
