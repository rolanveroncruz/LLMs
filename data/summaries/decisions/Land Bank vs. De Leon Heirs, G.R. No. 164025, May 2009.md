## Legal Document Summary - *Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Heirs of Honorato De Leon* (G.R. No. 164025)

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding just compensation for agricultural land acquired under the agrarian reform program.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over the just compensation for 36.1238 hectares of agricultural land in Nueva Ecija acquired by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 27.
*   **Parties:** Petitioner is Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), the financial intermediary for agrarian reform. Respondents are the heirs of Honorato De Leon, the landowner.
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   Respondents filed a complaint with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) sitting as a Special Agrarian Court (SAC) challenging the DAR's land valuation.
    *   A compromise agreement was initially reached and approved, but later set aside by the SAC due to lack of authority on the part of the DAR representative.
    *   The SAC rendered a decision ordering LBP to pay a specific amount as just compensation.
    *   LBP appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the SAC's decision.
    *   The CA was asked to nullify the jurisdiction that it assumed in this case.
    *   LBP filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari with the Supreme Court (SC).
*   **Core Issue:** The appropriate formula and data to be used in determining just compensation for the land.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **LBP's Obligation:** To pay just compensation to the landowners. The *amount* of just compensation is the central dispute.
*   **Liability Considerations:** This case focuses primarily on the *method* of calculation, not LBP's obligation to pay.

**Statutory References and Case Law:**

*   **P.D. No. 27:** Original decree covering land reform, especially rice and corn lands.
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law/CARL):** Superseded P.D. No. 27 and governs agrarian reform. Section 75 provides for the suppletory effect of P.D. 27 and E.O. 228/229. Section 17 outlines factors for determining just compensation.
*   **Executive Order (E.O.) No. 228:** Addresses the mode of compensation under P.D. No. 27.
*   **DAR A.O. No. 5, Series of 1998:** The most recent DAR issuance regarding the valuation formula for just compensation.
*   **Key Case Law:**
    *   *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Heirs of Domingo:* Reaffirms the principle of balancing the interests of the landowner and farmer-beneficiaries.
    *   *Paris v. Alfeche:* Holds that R.A. No. 6657 applies if its passage supervened before payment of just compensation.
    *   *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada:* Emphasizes that the factors under Sec. 17 of R.A. No. 6657 are translated into a basic formula by the DAR.
    *   *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Sps. Banal:* States that the applicable formula for just compensation is DAR A.O. No. 6, series of 1992, as amended by DAR A.O. No. 11, series of 1994, is the governing regulation for lands subject to compulsory acquisition.
    *   *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Lim:* Requires that the proper procedure is to remand the case to the SAC for determination of just compensation strictly in accordance with the applicable DAR regulation.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **Applicability of P.D. No. 27 vs. R.A. No. 6657:** LBP argued that P.D. No. 27 and E.O. No. 228 should govern, using a fixed price of P35.00 for palay. The Court rejected this, holding that R.A. No. 6657 applies because just compensation was not yet paid when it took effect.
*   **Validity of Compromise Agreement:** The Court did not directly address the validity of the compromise agreement, as this was addressed in G.R. No. 166972, which was dismissed on procedural grounds. The case hinged on the proper formula, not whether a previous agreement was binding.
*   **DAR's Authority:** The earlier dismissal of the compromise agreement by the SAC highlights the potential risk of unauthorized actions by government representatives.

**Potential Risks and Considerations:**

*   **Remand for Re-evaluation:** The SC remanded the case to the SAC for re-evaluation of just compensation based on DAR A.O. No. 5, Series of 1998. This means further litigation and potential for a higher valuation than LBP initially proposed.
*   **Application of Formula:** There might be disputes regarding the specific application of the DAR A.O. No. 5 formula, requiring further evidence and legal arguments regarding the factors outlined in Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 (e.g., current value of like properties, actual use, etc.).
*   **Interest:** The decision specifically states the SAC should determine the just compensation "strictly in accordance with DAR A.O. No. 5, series of 1998". The A.O. addresses interest; therefore it must be factored in the SAC's determination.

**SC Ruling:**

The SC **DENIED** LBP's petition, **REVERSED** the CA decision, and **REMANDED** the case to the SAC for determination of just compensation in accordance with DAR A.O. No. 5, Series of 1998.
