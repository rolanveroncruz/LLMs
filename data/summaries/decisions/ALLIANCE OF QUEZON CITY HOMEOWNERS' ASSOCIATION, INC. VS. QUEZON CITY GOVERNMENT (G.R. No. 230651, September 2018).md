## Legal Document Summary: Alliance of Quezon City Homeowners' Association, Inc. vs. Quezon City Government

**Case:** *Alliance of Quezon City Homeowners' Association, Inc. vs. Quezon City Government* (G.R. No. 230651, September 18, 2018)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus challenging the constitutionality and legality of Quezon City (QC) Ordinance No. SP-2556, Series of 2016 (the 2016 Ordinance), which revised real property assessments.

**Key Provisions of the 2016 Ordinance:**

*   Approved revised schedule of Fair Market Values (FMVs) for lands, buildings, and other structures.
*   Increased FMVs significantly (up to 500% from 1995 Ordinance).
*   Set new assessment levels: 5% for residential, 14% for commercial/industrial.
*   Effectivity: January 1, 2017 for land; 2018 for buildings/structures.

**Petitioner's Arguments:**

*   **Unconstitutionality:** Violation of substantive due process as the increased FMVs are unjust, excessive, oppressive, arbitrary, and confiscatory (Sec. 130, Local Government Code - LGC).
*   **Invalidity:** Violation of Sec. 130 of the LGC.
*   Arbitrary FMVs without factual basis or clear standards.
*   Lack of meaningful consultation as required by law.
*   Abrupt effectivity of the ordinance.

**Respondents' Arguments:**

*   **Procedural Infirmities:**
    *   Failure to exhaust administrative remedies (protest to City Treasurer, appeal to Secretary of Justice per LGC Sections 226, 252, and 187).
    *   Violation of hierarchy of courts by direct filing with the Supreme Court.
    *   Lack of legal capacity to sue (revoked SEC registration, no HLURB registration).
    *   Not a real party-in-interest (doesn't own affected property).
*   **Substantive Validity:**
    *   Compliance with formal and substantive requirements.
    *   Extensive public consultations.
    *   Reasonable increase tempered by decreased assessment levels.
    *   Use of DOF Local Assessment Regulation No. 1-92 guidelines.
    *   Justified increase due to economic/market forces since 1995.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   **Dismissed** the petition due to **Alliance's lack of legal capacity to sue**.
*   The Court addressed the procedural issues raised in the case which are: 
     *   **Exceptions to Procedural Doctrines:** While the Court acknowledged the failure to exhaust administrative remedies and the violation of the hierarchy of courts, it relaxed these rules due to the **strong public interest** and **transcendental importance** of the issue.  The Court cited *Ferrer, Jr. v. Bautista*, 762 Phil. 233 (2015), in allowing direct resort to it.
*    *   **Lack of legal Capacity to Sue** The petitioner was found to be an unregistered association. Citing Association of Flood Victims (AFV) v. Commission on Elections,740 Phil. 472, 480 (2014). See also Dueñas v. Santos Subdivision Homeowners Association, 474 Phil. 834, 846-847 (2004) and Samahang Magsasaka ng 53 Hektarya v. Mosquera, 547 Phil. 560, 570 (2007).

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Local Government Code (RA 7160):** Sections 130, 187, 212, 219, 226, 252.
*   **DOF Local Assessment Regulation No. 1-92:** Guidelines for assessing real properties.
*   **Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2010-01 (DILG and DOF):** Directing LGU compliance with Section 219 of the LGC.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Legal Capacity Issue:** The dismissal based on the petitioner's lack of legal capacity leaves the underlying constitutional and legal questions unanswered. A proper party could refile the challenge.
*   **Substantive Due Process Argument:** The core argument hinges on whether the increased FMVs are "unjust, excessive, oppressive, arbitrary, and confiscatory." This is a fact-intensive inquiry that the Court did not reach.
*   **Consultation Sufficiency:** The adequacy of public consultations is contentious. The petitioner alleges lack of proper notice and insufficient timeframe. If a proper party refiles, this issue is likely to be re-litigated.

**Conclusion:**

While the Court dismissed the petition on a technical ground, the underlying issue regarding the validity and constitutionality of the QC ordinance remains unresolved. A proper party (e.g., individual homeowners or a duly registered association) could initiate a similar challenge, requiring a full adjudication of the substantive due process and consultation arguments. The issued TRO was lifted.
