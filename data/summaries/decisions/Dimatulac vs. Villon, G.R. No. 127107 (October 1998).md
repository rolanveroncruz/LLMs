**Legal Document Summary: *Peter Paul Dimatulac and Veronica Dimatulac vs. Hon. Sesinando Villon, et al.* (G.R. No. 127107, October 12, 1998)**

**Nature:** Special Civil Action for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus under Rule 65.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Peter Paul and Veronica Dimatulac (Children of deceased PO3 Virgilio Dimatulac).
*   **Respondents:** Hon. Sesinando Villon (Presiding Judge, RTC Pampanga, Branch 54), Hon. Teofisto Guingona (Secretary of Justice), Mayor Santiago Yabut, Servillano Yabut, Martin Yabut, and Fortunato Mallari.

**Key Issues:**

*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion by Provincial Prosecutor:** Whether the Provincial Prosecutor committed grave abuse of discretion in: 1) Reinvestigating the case based on motion by the accused who were fugitives; 2) Filing information for Homicide despite knowledge of the appeal to the Secretary of Justice for Murder.
*   **Excess of Jurisdiction by RTC Judge:** Whether the RTC Judge acted in excess of jurisdiction in proceeding with the arraignment and denying motions to set aside arraignment, despite knowledge of the pending appeal and submission of evidence pointing to Murder.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion by Secretary of Justice:** Whether the Secretary of Justice committed grave abuse of discretion in reconsidering his initial order to amend the information from Homicide to Murder after the accused were arraigned.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Initial MCTC Finding:** The Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) found probable cause for Murder and issued arrest warrants for the accused, recommending no bail.
*   **Provincial Prosecutor's Resolution:** Assistant Provincial Prosecutor downgraded the charge to Homicide based on a reinvestigation, recommending bail of P20,000. Rationale: Absence of treachery due to lack of deliberate planning in the method of attack.
*   **Appeal to DOJ:** The Dimatulacs appealed, arguing the presence of treachery and other qualifying circumstances to elevate the charge to Murder.
*   **Filing of Homicide Information:** Despite the pending appeal, the Provincial Prosecutor filed an Information for Homicide against the YABUTs and "Danny Manalili."
*   **RTC Proceedings:** The RTC denied motions to defer proceedings and issued hold departure order, and set the arraignment.
*   **Secretary of Justice's Initial Ruling:** The Secretary of Justice initially ruled that treachery was present, directing amendment of the information to Murder and inclusion of Fortunato Mallari as an accused. Rationale: The attack was unexpected, depriving the victim of a chance to defend himself, and the method of attack was consciously adopted.
*   **Secretary of Justice's Reconsideration:** The Secretary of Justice subsequently reconsidered his order, stating that the arraignment rendered the appeal moot.
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court granted the petition, finding grave abuse of discretion by the Provincial Prosecutor, RTC Judge, and Secretary of Justice.
*   SC ruled that Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Alfonso-Reyes should not have conducted a reinvestigation since YABUTs were fugitives and that her recommendation for Homicide was blatant error, especially since private prosecution had convincing arguments to support the appeal for murder.
*   SC ruled that the DOJ's rule prohibiting appeals from resolutions of prosecutors only apply to appeals by accuseds since by submitting to arraignment, they voluntarily abandon their appeal.
*   SC ruled that Judges Roura and Villon acted with gross, grave and palpable abuse of discretion, depriving the State and the offended parties their day in court
*   SC set aside the lower court orders and the arraignment of the YABUTs, reinstated the Secretary of Justice's initial order for Murder charges, and directed the Provincial Prosecutor to file the amended information.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   The interpretation of Section 4 of DOJ Department Order No. 223 regarding appeals and their effect on pending court proceedings. The SC interpreted this Section to refer to appeals by the accused and not the offended party.
*   The propriety of the Provincial Prosecutor's reinvestigation and the acceptance of counter-affidavits from accused who were fugitives.
*   The RTC Judge's decision to proceed with the arraignment despite knowledge of the pending appeal and the Secretary of Justice's initial finding of probable cause for Murder.
*   The Secretary of Justice's reversal based solely on the fact of arraignment, foregoing its power of control and supervision of the Provincial Prosecutor

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   **Violation of Due Process:** The SC found that both the State and the offended parties were deprived of due process due to the actions of the Provincial Prosecutor and the RTC Judge.
*   **Accountability of Public Officials:** The SC emphasized the accountability of public officials and their duty to ensure that justice is served impartially.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** The SC held that because the arraignment was void, double jeopardy would not apply.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the lower court decisions, finding grave abuse of discretion. The case highlights the importance of impartiality and adherence to due process by prosecutors and judges, as well as the Secretary of Justice's oversight role. The YABUTs could now face trial for Murder.
