## Legal Document Summary: People v. Rivera

**Case:** G.R. No. 225786, November 14, 2018 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs - Violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165)

**Holding:** Accused-Appellant Juliet Rivera acquitted due to reasonable doubt arising from the prosecution's failure to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).  The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision affirming the RTC's guilty verdict.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs). Elements: (1) identity of buyer/seller, object, consideration; (2) delivery and payment. Requires proof beyond reasonable doubt. *People v. Opiana, 750 Phil. 140, 147 (2015)*
*   **Corpus Delicti:** The dangerous drug itself; stringent proof of chain of custody is essential. *People v. Guzon, 719 Phil. 441, 451 (2013)*
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Crucial Issue):** Specifies mandatory procedures for handling seized drugs to maintain integrity and evidentiary value:
    *   Immediate inventory and photographing after seizure.
    *   Presence of accused (or representative/counsel), elected public official, media representative, and DOJ representative *all at the time of seizure and inventory, and sign copies.*
*   **Prosecution's Failures (Basis for Acquittal):**
    *   **Non-Compliance with Three-Witness Rule:** The required witnesses were not present *at the time of seizure and apprehension.*, as they were only called after the buy-bust operation.
    *   **No Photograph taken:** The drug was not photographed at the place of seizure or at the police station.
    *   **No Justifiable Ground for Non-Compliance:** Prosecution failed to provide any explanation or justification for non-compliance with Section 21.
*   **"Saving Clause" of IRR Section 21 (a) Not Applicable:** Prosecution did not acknowledge lapses or provide justifiable explanation. *People v. Reyes, 797 Phil. 671 (2016)*
*   **Presumption of Regularity Overcome:** Blatant procedural lapses negate the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.  Presumption of innocence prevails. *People v. Mendoza, supra note 32, at 769-770*. The court also cited non-compliance with internal procedures per the 1999 PNP Drug Enforcement Manual. *People v. Zheng Bai Hui, 393 Phil. 68, 133 (2000)*
*   **Chain of Custody Broken:** Procedural lapses created doubt as to whether the substance seized was the same one presented in court.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution:** Burden to prove compliance with Section 21, RA 9165.  Failure leads to acquittal.
*   **Law Enforcement:** Strict adherence to Section 21 and internal operational procedures (PNP Drug Enforcement Manual).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Strict Interpretation of Section 21:**  The court emphasized the mandatory nature of the witness requirements *at the time of seizure,* potentially impacting future cases where witnesses are not physically present at the point of arrest.
*   **Reliance on Technicalities:** While the decision emphasizes procedural safeguards, it could be argued it allows for acquittals based on technicalities rather than the actual guilt or innocence of the accused.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Opiana, 750 Phil. 140, 147 (2015)*
*   *People v. Guzon, 719 Phil. 441, 451 (2013)*
*   *People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014)*
*   *People v. Reyes, 797 Phil. 671 (2016)*
*   *People v. Zheng Bai Hui, 393 Phil. 68, 133 (2000)*
*   *People v. Lim, G.R. No. 231989, September 4, 2018*
* *People v. Tomawis, G.R. No. 228890, April 18, 2018.*

**Statutory References:**

*   RA 9165, Section 5 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs)
*   RA 9165, Section 21 (Custody and Disposition of Seized Drugs)
*   IRR of RA 9165, Section 21(a)
*   Revised Penal Code, Article 125 (Arbitrary Detention)
*   Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 14, par. (2). (Presumption of innocence)

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the crucial importance of strict adherence to Section 21 of RA 9165 in drug cases. Failure to comply, without justifiable explanation, will likely result in acquittal, even if a buy-bust operation appears valid on the surface. The ruling reinforces the need for law enforcement to prioritize procedural correctness to ensure convictions are not overturned on technical grounds and to safeguard against potential abuses.
