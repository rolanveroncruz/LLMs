**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Teodoro*, G.R. No. 185164**

**Overview:** This is a Supreme Court decision affirming the conviction of Frederick Richie Teodoro for violation of Sections 5 (sale of dangerous drugs) and 11 (possession of dangerous drugs) of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002). The case stems from a buy-bust operation.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Violations:** Teodoro was found guilty of selling 0.04 gram of *shabu* (methamphetamine hydrochloride) in violation of Section 5 and possessing 0.06 gram of *shabu* in violation of Section 11 of R.A. 9165.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** Evidence from PO1 Climacosa, the poseur-buyer, was deemed credible in establishing the illegal sale. The Court relied on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty by law enforcement agents.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The Court found the chain of custody of the seized drugs was sufficiently established, despite arguments of non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and Section 2 of Dangerous Drugs Board Resolution No. 1. Crucially, the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved.
*   **Confidential Informant:** Non-presentation of the confidential informant was not fatal to the prosecution's case, as the informant's testimony was deemed merely corroborative (citing *People v. Lopez* and *People v. Naquita*). The *corpus delicti*, including the actual sale, was established by the poseur-buyer's testimony.
*   **Defense:** The defenses of frame-up and extortion were rejected due to lack of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused:** To comply with the imposed sentence.
*   **PDEA:** To properly dispose of the confiscated drugs.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Subject to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 for the sale of dangerous drugs (Sec. 5, RA 9165) and imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, as maximum, and a fine of P300,000.00 for possession of dangerous drugs (Sec. 11, RA 9165).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody Compliance:** Although the Court upheld the chain of custody in this case, *strict* compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 is consistently scrutinized in drug cases. Future cases may be vulnerable if procedures are not meticulously followed. **Risk**: Potential for overturning convictions based on weak chain of custody evidence.
*   **Reliance on Presumption of Regularity:** While the Court relies on this presumption, it acknowledges the danger of abuse by law enforcement. **Risk**: Potential for wrongful convictions if the defense can present compelling evidence of frame-up or extortion.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law application:** Clarification was needed here.
*    **Evidence Admissibility**: Evidence must be carefully handled and presented to ensure its validity and avoid challenges regarding its admissibility.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sections 5 and 11.
*   Dangerous Drugs Board Resolution No. 1, Section 2.

**Ambiguities:**

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court upheld the conviction based on the prosecution's evidence, particularly the testimony of the poseur-buyer and the established chain of custody. The case highlights the importance of adhering to procedural requirements in drug cases, even while maintaining the presumption of regularity in police operations.
