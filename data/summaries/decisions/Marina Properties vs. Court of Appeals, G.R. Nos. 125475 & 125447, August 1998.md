## Legal Document Summary: Marina Properties Corporation v. Court of Appeals and H.L. Carlos Construction, Inc. (G.R. Nos. 125447 & 125475)

**Core Issue:** Validity of Marina Properties Corporation's (MARINA) cancellation of a Contract to Purchase and Sell a condominium unit to H.L. Carlos Construction, Inc. (H.L. CARLOS) in light of Republic Act No. 6552 (Realty Installment Buyers Protection Act).  Also at issue is the propriety of damages awarded by the HLURB and affirmed by the Office of the President.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Contract to Purchase and Sell:** MARINA (seller) agreed to sell Unit B-121 to H.L. CARLOS (buyer) for P3,614,000.00.
*   **Payment Schedule:** H.L. CARLOS made a downpayment, cash deposit and monthly amortizations, eventually paying over 50% of the contract price (P1,810,330.70).
*   **MARINA's Obligation:** Delivery of the condominium unit upon H.L. CARLOS fulfilling payment obligations.
*   **Cancellation Clause:** MARINA attempted to cancel the contract citing H.L. CARLOS’ abandonment of its construction work on Phase III and filing of "baseless suits."

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **MARINA's Liability:** The Court found MARINA liable for illegally cancelling the contract in violation of R.A. 6552. The original award of actual damages was overturned on appeal.
*   **H.L. CARLOS's Obligations:** H.L. CARLOS remains obligated to pay the remaining balance on the contract price to receive the unit and title.
*   **Potential Risks:** MARINA risks further liability and penalties if it continues to obstruct the delivery of the unit. H.L. CARLOS risks losing its right to acquire the unit if it fails to pay the remaining balance.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6552 (Realty Installment Buyers Protection Act):**  Crucial statute governing the rights of installment buyers and the procedures for contract cancellation.  The decision hinges on MARINA's failure to comply with the notarial cancellation requirement of R.A. 6552.  Cites *Realty Exchange v. Sendino, 233 SCRA 665 (1994).*
*   **P.D. 957 (The Subdivision and Condominium Buyers’ Protective Decree):** Section 24 specifically refers to RA 6552.
*   **Article 2199, Civil Code:**  Governs recovery of actual damages, requiring proof of pecuniary loss.  The absence of evidence led to the reversal of the award of actual damages. *Scott Consultants & Resource Development Corporation, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 242 SCRA 393 (1995).*
*   **Forum Shopping:** Distinguished from related case, Civil Case No. 89-5870, highlighting separate causes of action. *Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco, 234 SCRA 455 (1994)*
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** Discusses what constitutes a pro forma motion, referencing *Guerra Enterprises, Co. Inc. v. CFI of Lanao del Sur, 32 SCRA 314 (1970).*

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Justification for Cancellation:**  MARINA's claim of "abandonment" by H.L. CARLOS was insufficient to justify the cancellation under R.A. 6552. The Court implied that reliance on alleged abandonment would potentially require separate justification independent of payment issues.

**Summary of Court Ruling**

The Supreme Court denied both petitions and affirmed the Court of Appeals decision. MARINA's cancellation of the contract was illegal due to non-compliance with R.A. 6552. H.L. CARLOS is entitled to specific performance upon fulfilling its payment obligations. The award of actual damages to H.L. CARLOS was properly overturned by the Court of Appeals due to lack of substantiating evidence. The Court also held that the complaint was not barred by res judicata, lis pendens or the prohibition against splitting a cause of action.
