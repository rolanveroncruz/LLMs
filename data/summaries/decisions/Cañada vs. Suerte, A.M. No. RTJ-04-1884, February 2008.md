**Case:** *Silas Y. Cañada vs. Ildefonso B. Suerte* (A.M. No. RTJ-04-1884, February 22, 2008)

**Summary:** This is an administrative case against former Judge Ildefonso B. Suerte (RTC, Barili, Cebu) initiated by Silas Y. Cañada. Cañada alleged grave misconduct, abuse of authority, and violations of the RPC and Canons of Judicial Ethics stemming from a failed real estate transaction where Suerte acted as a broker. The Court found insufficient evidence to support Cañada's claims regarding coercion and abuse of power. However, it found Suerte liable for **dishonesty** based on discrepancies between his sworn statements (SALN) and his claims regarding ownership of a Daewoo car and a cargo pick-up truck.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Dishonesty:** The core finding. Defined as a disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud. (See *Re: (1) Lost Checks…Ms. Esther T. Andres*, A.M. No. 2005-26-SC)
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) Violations:** Violated Canons 1 and 11, and Rules 1.01 and 10.01 (engaging in dishonest conduct, failing to maintain respect for courts, making false statements). These were cited as grounds for disbarment.
* **Sanctions**: While he was already dismissed in a previous case, the court imposed the maximum fine of P40,000 and disbarment.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Guilty of dishonesty.
*   **Penalty:** Fine of P40,000 (deducted from accrued leave credits, balance payable if insufficient).
*   **Disciplinary Action (as lawyer):** **Disbarment.** Name stricken from the Roll of Attorneys.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Hearsay Evidence:** The Court heavily discounted the affidavits submitted by the complainant, deeming them hearsay due to the affiants not being presented for cross-examination.
*   **Concurrent Jurisdiction/Prior Dismissal:** The Court acknowledged Suerte's prior dismissal in *Re: Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the RTC, Branch 60, Barili, Cebu* (A.M. Nos. 04-7-373-RTC and 04-7-374-RTC) for gross misconduct, gross ignorance of the law, and incompetence. This factored into the penalty in the instant case.
*   **Intertwined Cases:** The Court noted the connection to *Cañada v. Suerte* (A.M. No. RTJ-04-1875) involving arbitrary detention arising from the same facts, highlighting a pattern of behavior.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Article 215 mentioned in original complaint, though not ultimately the basis of the ruling. Article 124 cited in the connected case A.M. No. RTJ-04-1875.
*   **Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Section 11(a) cited for sanctions for serious charges.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 138, Section 27:** Grounds for disbarment and suspension of attorneys.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):** Canons 1 & 11, Rules 1.01 & 10.01.
*   **A.M. No. 02-9-02-SC:** Automatic conversion of administrative cases against judges to disciplinary proceedings for lawyers.
*   **Substantial Evidence Standard:** Cited in *Lanuza v. Cepe*, A.M. No. P-06-2174.
*   **Definition of Dishonesty:** *Re: (1) Lost Checks…Ms. Esther T. Andres*, A.M. No. 2005-26-SC, citing *Re: Administrative Case for Dishonesty Against Elizabeth Ting…*, A.M. No. 2001-7-SC.
*   **CSC Rules:**  Referenced regarding dismissal for dishonesty.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Weight of Affidavits:** The dismissal of most of the charges rested heavily on the lack of cross-examination of the affiants. This highlights the Court's preference for direct testimony, but might be viewed as a high bar for administrative complaints.
*   **Discrepancy between Complainant and Respondent accounts:** The Court opted to go with the finding of dishonesty because SALNs are official records.
