**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Gianne Carla Thanaraj y Gloria*, G.R. No. 262944, July 29, 2024

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Summary:**
The Supreme Court *acquitted* Gianne Carla Thanaraj y Gloria of parricide under Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code, reversing the Court of Appeals' (CA) and Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decisions.  The charge stemmed from the death of her husband, Mervin Roy Richard Thanaraj y Manansala, due to a stab wound to the neck.

**Key Provisions/Elements of Parricide:**
*   The prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt:
    *   A death occurred.
    *   The accused was the killer.
    *   The deceased was a spouse, parent, child, ascendant, or descendant of the accused. (Relationship is an essential element.)
    *   A concurrence of actus reus and mens rea in the commission of the crime

**Prosecution's Case:**

*   **Witness Testimony:** The prosecution relied on the testimony of Jimar Moranta, a construction worker who claimed he heard Gianne exclaim, "tulungan niyo po ako, nasaksak ko ang asawa ko!" (Help me, I stabbed my husband!) The CA admitted this statement as *res gestae*.  Also, Dr. Aguda, a medico-legal officer, testified that it was unlikely the fatal stab wound was self-inflicted, based on its downward trajectory. PO1 Laleo, a Police Officer, testified that Gianne told her she did not intend to stab her husband, but this statement was not reduced to writing.
*   **DNA Evidence:** DNA evidence from the murder weapon was inconclusive due to lack of reference samples from the accused and victim.
*   **Marriage and Death Certificate:** Presented to prove the spousal relationship and the fact of death.

**Defense's Case:**

*   **Accused's Testimony:** Gianne testified that she and Mervin quarreled, and Mervin threatened suicide with a knife to his neck. She claims the stabbing was accidental during a struggle as she tried to leave.  She argued Mervin had a history of threatening suicide if she left him.

**Court's Reasoning for Acquittal:**

*   **Reasonable Doubt:** The SC found the prosecution failed to prove Gianne's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. They found the testimony of witnesses as insufficient to meet that high standard.
*   **Dr. Aguda's Testimony:** The Court deemed that Dr. Aguda's testimony did not conclusively prove Gianne's guilt. His opinion only established that there was a *remote* possibility the wound was self-inflicted, but not that it was definitely inflicted by another person with intent to kill.
*   **Mens Rea:** The Court emphasized the prosecution's failure to prove *mens rea* (criminal intent). Evidence suggested Mervin's intention was suicide if Gianne left, and Gianne's intention was merely to leave the house.
*   ***Res Gestae* Inapplicability:** The Court ruled that Gianne's statements to Jimar did *not* qualify as *res gestae*. Instead, they analyzed the statement as *admission against interest* and found them to be equivocal because Gianne was in shock and her statement was not categorical and definite.

    *   The Court referenced *People vs. Lupac* and *People vs. Paycana, Jr.* in determining the validity of statements given as evidence, as parts of *res gestae*.

    *   The Court, citing Rule 130, Section 36 of the Rules of Court, notes that witnesses can only testify to what they know of their personal knowledge. Further, Section 36 rules that Hearsay Evidence is inadmissable.
*   **Unconstitutional Admission:**  Gianne's statements to PO1 Laleo were ruled inadmissible because they were obtained during custodial investigation without counsel, violating Article III, Section 12 of the Constitution.

    *   The Court cited Article III, Section 12 of the Constitution.
*   **Equipoise Rule:** Due to the evenly balanced evidence, the constitutional presumption of innocence tilted the scales in Gianne's favor.

    *   The Court cited *People v. Maglinas* in noting the accused's enjoyment of the constitutional presumption of innocence until final conviction.
*   **Failure to Test Knife:** The prosecution's failure to perform DNA testing on the knife and call Gianne's children as witnesses weakened their case.

    *   The Court cited *People v. Ordiz* in noting the burden of the prosecution to provide sufficient evidence as proof of the existence of the elements of the crime.
    *   The Court cited *People v. Urzais* in holding that there should be an overthow of any doubt held of the accused, otherwise, the Court is in violation of the presumption of innocence.

**Concurrence and Dissent (Lazaro-Javier, J.):**
*   Concurred with the acquittal.
*   Disagreed with the ponencia's determination that her statement could not be considered part of res gestae because the defendant testified. Cites case law where statements of the declarant were held to be res gestae even if that person testified.

**Liabilities:**
*   Originally, the RTC ordered civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages of PHP 75,000.00 each.
*   CA increased to PHP 100,000.00 each.
*   Supreme Court's reversal removed all financial liability as the accused was acquitted.

**Potential Risks (Had the Court Ruled Differently):**

*   **Reclusion Perpetua:**  Gianne faced a sentence of *reclusion perpetua* (life imprisonment) if convicted of parricide under Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code:**  Parricide definition and penalties.
*   **Article III, Section 12 of the Constitution:** Rights of the accused during custodial investigation.
*   **Rule 130, Sections 27 and 36 of the Rules of Court:** Admissions and hearsay evidence.
*   **People vs. Lupac, 695 Phil. 505 (2012):** Concerning that even the out-of-court statements of witnesses who testified during trial can be considered as part of the res gestae
*   **People v. Maglinas, G.R. No. 255496 (2022):** Concerning the accused's enjoyment of the constitutional presumption of innocence until final conviction.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Intent:** The major point of contention was whether Gianne intended to kill Mervin (mens rea). The evidence was ambiguous, leading to the Court's decision to apply the presumption of innocence.
*   **Interpretation of Gianne's Statements:** Whether Gianne's statements to Jimar constituted an admission of guilt, or were merely an expression of shock and remorse, was heavily debated.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court acquitted Gianne due to the prosecution's failure to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, primarily focusing on the lack of evidence to establish criminal intent. The case highlights the importance of proving both the act and the mental state in criminal prosecutions.
