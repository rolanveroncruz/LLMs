## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Albalate, Jr.* (G.R. No. 174480)

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed with modification the Court of Appeals' decision finding Reynaldo Albalate, Jr. guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of rape against his niece, "Maria." The accused raised defenses of denial and alibi, which were rejected by the lower courts. The Court ultimately found the victim's testimony credible and sufficient for conviction.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charges:** Two counts of rape under Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by R.A. 8353.
*   **Elements:** Carnal knowledge achieved through force, threat, or intimidation. Original information charged the aggravating circumstance of minority of the victim (12 years old) and relationship to the offender, which was not proven in court.
*   **Penalties:** Reclusion perpetua for each count of rape.
*   **Civil Liability:** P50,000.00 civil indemnity and P50,000.00 moral damages per count, plus P30,000.00 exemplary damages per count due to the aggravating circumstance of relationship.

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused:** Fulfills the penalties imposed by the court, including imprisonment and payment of damages.
*   **State:** Obligated to protect the victim and ensure the enforcement of the judgment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Found guilty of two counts of rape.
*   **Civil Liability:** Liable for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Minority:** The prosecution failed to conclusively prove the victim's minority at the time of the offense. This failure prevented the imposition of the death penalty, despite the existence of the element of the offender being a relative within the 3rd civil degree.
*   **Reliance on Victim's Testimony:** The conviction heavily relied on the credibility of the victim's testimony. Although permissible under existing jurisprudence, this presents a risk if the testimony is later challenged or recanted.
*   **Defense of Alibi:** The defendant presented a late alibi, which was also rejected.
*   **Weapon:** While one information alleged the use of a deadly weapon (ice pick), this was not a significant factor in the final judgment. The original decision notes that if an offender uses a deadly weapon then the death penalty can be imposed, and the court notes the need for aggravating circumstances in order to determine the proper penalty.
