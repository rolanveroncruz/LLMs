**Case Summary: *Dela Cruz-Sillano v. Pangan*, A.C. No. 5851 (2008)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Wilfredo Paul D. Pangan for disbarment based on allegations of conspiring to forge a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) and notarizing it in the absence of the affiant, Zenaida A. Dela Cruz.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Allegation:** Atty. Pangan allegedly notarized an SPA on March 15, 1999, authorizing Ronaldo Apostol to claim insurance benefits of Zenaida A. Dela Cruz. Complainant, Zenaida's daughter, alleges that Zenaida was bedridden in the US at the time and died shortly after.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Atty. Pangan claims the notarization was "in accordance with law and practice" and that he did not benefit from or conspire in the alleged falsification.
*   **Affidavit from Apostol:** Apostol admits he had the SPA prepared and that the Zenaida did not personally appear before Atty. Pangan but his office staff vouched for her identity.
*   **IBP Findings:** The Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) found Atty. Pangan guilty of notarizing the SPA without the affiant's presence.
*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court upheld the IBP's findings, finding Atty. Pangan guilty of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and his oath as a lawyer.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Notarial Law (Public Act No. 2103, Sec. 1(a)):** Requires the notary public to certify that the person acknowledging the instrument is known to him and that he is the same person who executed it, acknowledging that the same is his free act and deed.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 1, Rule 1.01:** Prohibits lawyers from engaging in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.
*   **Rules on Notarial Practice of 2004, Rule IV, Sec. 2(b):** Explicitly requires the signatory to be personally present before the notary public and either personally known or identified through competent evidence of identity.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Suspension from Practice:** Atty. Pangan was suspended from the practice of law for one year.
*   **Revocation of Notarial Commission:** His incumbent notarial commission (if any) was revoked.
*   **Prohibition from Recommissioning:** He was prohibited from being commissioned as a notary public for one year.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Categorical Denial:** Atty. Pangan's defense focused on objecting to the evidence rather than directly denying the core allegation of notarizing without the affiant's presence.
*   **Reliance on Staff:** The affidavits from his staff, intended to support him, arguably reinforced the fact that the affiant was not personally present.
*   **Disregard of Due Diligence:** Accommodating relatives by waiving the personal appearance requirement was deemed unacceptable, highlighting the importance of due diligence in notarial acts.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Bernardo v. Atty. Ramos*, 433 Phil. 8 (2002):** Emphasizes the purpose of requiring the affiant's physical presence to verify the genuineness of the signature and ensure the document is the party's free act and deed.
*   ***Arrieta v. Llosa*, 346 Phil. 932 (1997):** Underscores the public interest and solemnity associated with notarization, requiring utmost care from notaries public.
*   ***Follosco v. Atty. Mateo*, 466 Phil. 305 (2004):** Confirms that a lawyer is liable for negligence in performing notarial duties.

**Conclusion:**

This case underscores the strict requirements for notarization and the severe consequences for lawyers who fail to comply, especially the requirement for the affiant's personal appearance. Atty. Pangan's actions, even if done to "accommodate" relatives, constituted a serious breach of professional ethics and resulted in significant penalties. The case highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity of notarial acts and the risks associated with deviating from established procedures.
