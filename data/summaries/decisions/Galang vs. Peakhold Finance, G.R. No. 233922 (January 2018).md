**Case Summary: *Ma. Victoria M. Galang vs. Peakhold Finance Corporation*, G.R. No. 233922, January 24, 2018**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC dismissal of a complaint for annulment of deed of real estate mortgage and foreclosure proceedings due to forum shopping.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over a 150 sq. m. lot in Caloocan City (TCT No. 327548) mortgaged to Peakhold. Petitioner claims forgery and lack of consent in the mortgage.
*   **Annulment Case (Civil Case No. C-22988):** Filed by Galang in RTC Caloocan to annul the mortgage and foreclosure sale, alleging forgery. Amended to include prayer for reconveyance.
*   **Ex-Parte Petition for Writ of Possession (LRC Case No. C-6032):** Filed by Peakhold in RTC Caloocan, granted.
*   **Petition for Relief from Judgment:** Filed by Galang against the grant of the writ of possession. Dismissed by the RTC based on forum shopping.
*   **Certiorari Case (CA-G.R. SP No. 133782):** Filed by Galang, questioning the dismissal of the Petition for Relief. CA dismissed this case on the merits, finding no extrinsic fraud.
*   **Criminal Complaint:** Galang filed a criminal complaint for Qualified Theft against Peakhold's President and an associate.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Initially denied motion to dismiss, then reconsidered and dismissed the Annulment Case for forum shopping.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC, finding forum shopping due to failure to disclose the pending Certiorari Case and Criminal Complaint in the Amended Complaint and identifying identity of parties, causes of action, and reliefs sought across the cases.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed the CA, holding no forum shopping. The Court found that the cases involved different causes of actions, reliefs, and issues and that any judgment in one case would not necessarily amount to res judicata in the action under consideration.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Galang:** Obligation to disclose all related cases in her pleadings. Liability for sanctions (dismissal) if found guilty of forum shopping.
*   **Peakhold:** Potential liability if the mortgage is proven fraudulent.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Forum Shopping Allegation:** The central contentious issue. The Supreme Court found no forum shopping because each case has a distinct cause of action, relief sought, and issue.
*   **Validity of Mortgage:** The validity of the mortgage is a core issue in the Annulment Case, relying on the allegation of forgery. This remains unresolved, pending revival of the Annulment Case.
*   **Res Judicata/Litis Pendentia:** These principles were argued as the basis for forum shopping but were ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court provisions on forum shopping:** The court applies established jurisprudence on forum shopping, specifically defining the three ways it can be committed and emphasizing the need for identity of parties, rights asserted, reliefs prayed for, and causes of action (Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association v. Fil-Estate Properties, Inc., 766 Phil. 382, 410-411 (2015)).
*   **Principles of Res Judicata and Litis Pendentia:** Used as basis for the dismissal of the motion for reconsideration, but ultimately refuted by the Supreme Court.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "identity of cause of action" element of forum shopping was the most contentious aspect, with the lower courts and Supreme Court differing on its application.
*   Whether the failure to disclose all pending related cases, in itself, constitutes forum shopping, even if the cases are distinct.

**Legal Advice:**

*   The Annulment Case has been revived and remanded. Focus on proving the forgery claim in the Annulment Case.
*   Since the cases have different issues, causes of action, and reliefs prayed for, the Supreme Court has effectively insulated Galang's multiple filings from further forum shopping allegations.
