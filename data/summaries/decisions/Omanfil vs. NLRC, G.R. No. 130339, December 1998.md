**Legal Document Summary: Omanfil International Manpower Development Corporation vs. NLRC and Lora Felipe, G.R. No. 130339**

**Case Overview:** This is a *certiorari* petition by Omanfil International Manpower Development Corporation (Omanfil), challenging two NLRC resolutions awarding death benefits of US$27,902.02 plus 10% attorney's fees to Lora Felipe (Felipe) for the death of her husband, Eduardo Felipe, who died in a ferry boat accident while working in Malaysia for Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (Hyundai).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Work Contract:** Eduardo Felipe was hired by Hyundai through Omanfil as an Offshore Rigger. The work contract presumably outlines obligations regarding death benefits, though this is not explicitly stated.
*   **Malaysian Law:** The claim is governed by Malaysian law, specifically the Workmen's Compensation Act 1952 (Act 273), Section 8(a), which stipulates a lump sum equal to 45 months' earnings or RM14,400, whichever is less, in case of death resulting from injury.
*   **Payment of Benefits:** Section 10(1) of the Workmen's Compensation Act 1952 mandates deposit of death benefits with the Commissioner of Labour, not direct payment to the dependent.
*   **Malaysian Labor Office Certification:** The Melaka Labor Office issued a certification indicating a potential claim of US$27,902.02 but also noted the RM14,400 limit per Malaysian law.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Labor Arbiter and NLRC initially held Omanfil liable for US$27,902.02 based on an ambiguous interpretation of the Melaka Labor Office certification and the principle of resolving doubts in labor cases in favor of the worker. This was overturned. The Supreme Court held liability was extinguished when Omanfil's client deposited RM14,400 with the Melaka Labour Office.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Melaka Labor Office Certification:** The initial ambiguity in the Melaka Labor Office's certification regarding the amount due (citing both the calculation based on 45 months of salary and the RM14,400 cap) led to the initial rulings favoring the private respondent.
*   **Interpretation of Malaysian Law:** The NLRC initially misinterpreted Malaysian law regarding compensation amounts and the proper mode of payment.
*   **Disregard of Documentary Evidence:** The NLRC initially disregarded the express language of Annexes "I", "I-1", "I-2", "I-3", and "I-4".

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Workmen's Compensation Act of Malaysia 1952 (Act 273):** Section 8(a) defining compensation for death; Section 10(1) mandating payment via deposit with the Commissioner of Labour.
*   **Aquino et al. vs. NLRC, et al., G.R. No. 8763, February 11, 1992:** Initially relied upon by the NLRC regarding the interpretation of the labour laws. This was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court.
*   **Sarmiento vs. Employees Compensation Commission, 103 SCRA 329:** Initially relied upon by the NLRC regarding the interpretation of the labour laws. This was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The certification from the Melaka Labor Office indicating both a higher calculated amount (US$27,902.02) and the legal cap (RM14,400) created ambiguity regarding the intended compensation.

**Supreme Court Decision:**

The Supreme Court granted the petition, annulling the NLRC resolutions. It held that Malaysian law clearly limited the death benefit to RM14,400 and that Omanfil discharged its obligation by ensuring that Hyundai deposited that amount with the Melaka Labor Office, as required by Malaysian law. The court emphasized that it was not the responsibility of the agent to provide the next of kin with the amount required, but instead to comply with the relevant Malaysian laws and to deposit with the relevant authorities.
