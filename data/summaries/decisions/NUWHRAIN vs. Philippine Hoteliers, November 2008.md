Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *National Union of Workers in the Hotel Restaurant and Allied Industries (NUWHRAIN-APL-IUF) Dusit Hotel Nikko Chapter v. Court of Appeals, et al.* G.R. No. 163942 & G.R. No. 166295, November 11, 2008

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45) and Certiorari (Rule 65) assailing CA decisions affirming NLRC and DOLE Secretary orders, respectively.  The dispute concerns a CBA deadlock, strike, lock-out, and related unfair labor practice allegations at Dusit Hotel Nikko.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **G.R. No. 163942 (Illegal Strike):**
    *   **Issue:** Whether the Union conducted an illegal strike on January 18 and 26, 2002.
    *   **Holding:** The Supreme Court found the Union liable for conducting an illegal strike.
    *   **Rationale:**
        *   **Violation of Grooming Standards:** Concerted action to violate hotel grooming standards (shaved/cropped heads) was a deliberate attempt to undermine the hotel and disrupt operations, not a protected activity.
        *   **Breach of CBA "No Strike" Clause:**  The strike, stemming from a bargaining deadlock, violated a clause prohibiting strikes/work stoppages during the CBA's term. Cites *Philippine Metal Foundaries, Inc. v. CIR*.
        *   **Failure to Bargain in Good Faith:**  The grooming violation impeded conciliation efforts.
        *   **Violation of Cooling-Off and Strike Ban Periods:** The strike occurred *before* the expiration of the mandatory 30-day cooling-off period (Art. 263(c) of the Labor Code) and 7-day strike ban (Art. 263(f) of the Labor Code).
        *   **Commission of Illegal Acts During Strike:**  The Union engaged in illegal acts (blocking ingress/egress), constituting picketing beyond permissible bounds. The Court relied on factual findings of the NLRC and CA regarding the human barricades.

*   **G.R. No. 166295 (Secretary of Labor's Authority on Payroll Reinstatement):**
    *   **Issue:** Whether the Secretary of Labor has the discretion to order payroll reinstatement in lieu of actual reinstatement when assuming jurisdiction over a labor dispute.
    *   **Holding:** Secretary has the discretion to order Payroll reinstatement.
    *   **Rationale:** Generally, Art. 263(g) mandates actual reinstatement in AJ cases to avoid work stoppage. Payroll reinstatement is an exception. Applies *University of Immaculate Concepcion, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor*. The Court reasoned that the antagonism between the hotel and union coupled with the impracticability of reinstating employees with altered hairstyles justified the Secretary's decision.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Union Officers:** 29 Union officers were declared to have lost their employment status due to their knowing participation in an illegal strike.  Art. 264(a) paragraph 3 of the Labor Code, *Toyota Motor Phils. Corp. Workers Association (TMPCWA) v. National Labor Relations Commission.*
*   **Union Members:** 61 Union members were ordered reinstated to their former positions *without backwages*.  The Hotel failed to prove specific illegal acts by each member. *G & S Transport Corporation v. Infante*. If reinstatement is not feasible due to hiring of replacements, the hotel may opt for separation pay at one month's pay per year of service.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 212(o) of the Labor Code (Definition of Strike)
*   Article 263(c), (f) and (g) of the Labor Code (Strikes, Picketing, and Lockouts; Cooling-Off Period, Strike Vote Requirements, and Assumption of Jurisdiction)
*   Article 264(a) of the Labor Code (Prohibited Activities and Unfair Labor Practices -  Consequences of Illegal Strikes)
*   Rule XIII, Section 6 of the Implementing Rules of Book V of the Labor Code (Now Rule XXII, Sec. 9)

**Case Law:**

*   *Toyota Motor Phils. Corp. Workers Association (TMPCWA) v. National Labor Relations Commission* (Definition and types of illegal strike, consequences).
*   *Philippine Metal Foundaries, Inc. v. CIR* (Economic strike and its relation to "no strike" clause).
*   *University of Immaculate Concepcion, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor* (Actual vs. Payroll Reinstatement).
*   *G & S Transport Corporation v. Infante* (Backwages and Reinstatement after an Illegal Strike).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Areas:**

*   **Factual Disputes:**  The factual findings regarding the specific acts of the Union members during the picket were pivotal.  The dissent might argue about the sufficiency of evidence linking each member to specific illegal acts. The court generally deferred to NLRC/CA findings.
*   **Discretion of Secretary of Labor:** The Secretary's discretion to order payroll reinstatement may be challenged in future cases. This case clarifies the exception to the general rule of actual reinstatement, emphasizing the need to show special circumstances.
*   **"Special Circumstances" Definition:** The definition of "special circumstances" justifying payroll reinstatement is somewhat subjective and could be subject to further litigation.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court largely sided with the employer, upholding the finding of an illegal strike and the dismissal of Union officers. While showing leniency towards Union members without specific evidence of illegal acts, the decision reinforces the importance of adhering to procedural requirements for strikes and respecting collective bargaining agreements. The case also provides further guidance on the Secretary of Labor's discretion in ordering payroll reinstatement in assumption of jurisdiction cases, albeit within narrowly defined circumstances.
