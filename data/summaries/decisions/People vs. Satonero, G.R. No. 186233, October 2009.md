**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Romeo Satonero @ Ruben*, G.R. No. 186233, October 2, 2009.

**Summary:**
This is an appeal affirming the conviction of Romeo Satonero for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. The RTC found Satonero guilty, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court also affirmed Satonero's conviction with modification on damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code (Murder):** Defines and penalizes murder. Relevant due to the conviction being based on this article.
*   **Self-Defense (Justifying Circumstance):** Satonero claimed self-defense, requiring proof of unlawful aggression, reasonable necessity of means, and lack of sufficient provocation. The Court found this defense unsubstantiated. *People v. Mara, G.R. No. 184050, May 8, 2009* sets forth the elements of self-defense.
*   **Treachery (Qualifying Circumstance):** The court upheld the finding of treachery (alevosia), meaning the attack was sudden and unexpected, depriving the victim of any chance of defense. This raised the crime to murder. *People v. Peralta, G.R. No. 128116, January 24, 2001* and *People v. De Guzman, G.R. No. 169082, August 17, 2007* are cited regarding treachery.
*   **Damages:** The initial indemnity for loss of life (P75,000) was upheld. Moral damages were increased from P50,000 to P75,000. Exemplary damages of P30,000 were awarded due to treachery (Article 2230, Civil Code).
*   **Voluntary Surrender (Mitigating Circumstance):** Considered by the RTC, leading to the imposition of *reclusion perpetua*.

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused-Appellant (Satonero):**
    *   Serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
    *   Pay civil indemnity of Php 75,000 to the heirs of Ramon Amigable.
    *   Pay moral damages of Php 75,000 to the heirs of Ramon Amigable.
    *   Pay exemplary damages of Php 30,000 to the heirs of Ramon Amigable.

**Liabilities:**

*   Conviction for murder.
*   Financial liability for damages to the victim's heirs.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Self-Defense Claim:** The entire case hinged on the self-defense claim, which was ultimately rejected due to a lack of proof of unlawful aggression from the victim. The credibility of witnesses (especially Leticia) was paramount.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:**  The court emphasized the trial court's superior position in assessing witness credibility due to direct observation. This highlights the importance of witness testimony.
*   **Lack of Corroborating Evidence:** The defense's failure to produce the alleged knife used by the victim weakened their self-defense claim.
*   **Treachery Debate:** The defense argued against treachery, claiming the attack's suddenness alone wasn't sufficient. The court disagreed, emphasizing the victim's defenselessness.
