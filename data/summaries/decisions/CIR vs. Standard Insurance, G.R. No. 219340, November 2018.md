**Legal Document Summary: CIR v. Standard Insurance Co., Inc., G.R. No. 219340 (2018)**

**Subject Matter:**  Appeal by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) challenging the RTC's jurisdiction to enjoin the enforcement of Sections 108 (VAT on Services) and 184 (DST on Insurance Policies) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) in an action for declaratory relief.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Sections 108 & 184, NIRC:**  Impose VAT on services (including non-life insurance) and DST on insurance policies, respectively.  These sections are the subject of the constitutional challenge by the Respondent.
*   **Section 218, NIRC:** Expressly prohibits courts from enjoining the collection of national internal revenue taxes, fees, or charges.
*   **Section 11, RA 1125 (as amended):** Decisions of the CIR assessing taxes are immediately executory and not suspended by appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) unless the CTA deems collection may jeopardize government/taxpayer interests, in which case a deposit or surety bond may be required.
*   **Rule 63, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Governs actions for declaratory relief.

**Facts:**

*   Standard Insurance (Respondent) received a Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) and subsequent Final Decision on Disputed Assessment (FDDA) from the BIR for deficiency documentary stamp taxes (DST) and other taxes for 2011, 2012, and 2013.
*   Respondent filed an action for declaratory relief in the RTC, challenging the constitutionality of Sections 108 and 184 of the NIRC, arguing unequal treatment of life and non-life insurance policies due to Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10001.
*   RTC granted a TRO and preliminary injunction, later permanently enjoining enforcement of Sections 108 and 184 pending Congressional action on House Bill 3235.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the RTC decision, holding the RTC lacked jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief against tax collection due to Section 218 of the NIRC.
*   The SC also found the action for declaratory relief procedurally improper under Rule 63, Rules of Court because:
    *   **Breach Existed:** The taxes had already been assessed, indicating a violation of the NIRC had occurred. Tax assessments are considered self-assessing.
    *   **No Actual Controversy:** Respondent's apprehension of insolvency was speculative and contingent on future legislative action (House Bill 3235). The existing tax provisions were presumed valid.
    *   **Adequate Remedy Existed:**  Respondent should have appealed the FDDA to the CTA instead of seeking declaratory relief in the RTC.  Failure to appeal rendered the assessment final.

**Liabilities and Obligations:**

*   Standard Insurance is obligated to pay the assessed DST and other taxes, including interest and penalties.
*   CIR has the obligation to correctly assess taxes and follow procedures.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Final Assessment:** Because the assessment became final, the Respondent is now liable for the taxes and may face collection efforts.
*   **Future Assessments:** Respondent could face continued assessments if it maintains its interpretation of the law.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Angeles City v. Angeles Electric Corporation, G.R. No. 166134, June 29, 2010:** Affirms the policy of prompt tax collection.
*   **Republic v. Roque, G.R. No. 204603, September 24, 2013:** Defines requisites for declaratory relief.
*   **Tupaz v. Ulep, G.R. No. 127777, October 1, 1999:** Discusses self-assessing nature of internal revenue taxes.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The underlying disagreement is the interpretation of the law surrounding the taxation of insurance policies.
*   The Respondent's reliance on pending legislative action (House Bill 3235) to justify its declaratory relief action was deemed premature.

**Legal Advice:** Advise the client, Standard Insurance, that the assessment is now final. Given the Supreme Court's clear rejection of the declaratory relief action and the prohibition on enjoining tax collection, legal options for avoiding payment are extremely limited. The best course of action is likely to negotiate a payment plan with the BIR or explore other compromise options within the NIRC's provisions. Any further legal action would need to proceed with extreme caution given the strong precedent against enjoining tax collection.
