**Case Summary: *Baladad v. Rublico, G.R. No. 160743 (2009)***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a CA decision reversing the RTC's decision in a complaint for annulment of sale, cancellation of title, and damages.

**Facts:** Julian Angeles owned two parcels of land. After marrying Corazon Rublico late in life, Julian died.  Corazon, days before her own death, purportedly executed an Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Absolute Sale, with her brother-in-law Epitacio, selling the land to Baladad. Sergio, Corazon's son from a previous relationship, later executed an Affidavit of Adjudication claiming sole heirship, reconstituted the title in his name, and sold the land to Spouses Yupano. Baladad sued to annul the sale to the Yupanos.

**Holding:** SC reversed the CA, upholding the validity of the Extrajudicial Settlement and Sale to Baladad and voiding the subsequent sale to the Yupanos.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Validity of Extrajudicial Settlement with Absolute Sale:** The central issue is the validity of the deed executed by Corazon days before her death.  Respondents argued lack of consent due to Corazon's weakness. The SC upheld the RTC finding that the respondents failed to prove that Corazon did not give her consent to the sale.
*   **Contract Law Application:** The Court applied Art. 1318 of the Civil Code, stating a contract of sale is perfected upon meeting of the minds on the object and price. The deed contained two severable contracts: adjudication of the estate and the absolute sale.
*   **Consent:** Court noted that although there was no signature of Cornelia in the document, it was Cornelia herself who brought the notary public to Corazon and her subsequent acts of dominion over the properties showed her consent of the sale.
*   **Good Faith Purchaser:** The SC held that the Yupanos were not purchasers in good faith.  Their proximity to the property, knowledge of Baladad's claim (through rental collection by her representative), and failure to adequately investigate Sergio's title put them on notice of a potential defect. *Abad v. Guimba* (G.R. No. 157002, July 29, 2005) was cited regarding the duty to inquire beyond the certificate of title.
*   **Nemo Dat Quod Non Habet:** SC applied this principle, finding Sergio could not validly sell what he did not own since Corazon had already sold the property to Baladad.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Sergio Rublico:** Obligated to return the P100,000 purchase price to the Yupanos, less expenses incurred in obtaining the invalid title (a point seemingly implying some degree of culpability on the Yupanos' part).
*   **Register of Deeds:** Ordered to cancel the Yupanos' titles and restore the original title.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Art. 1318:** Requisites of contracts.
*   **Civil Code Art. 1475:** Perfection of a contract of sale.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Quantification of "Expenses" deductible from P100,000:** The judgment allows Sergio to deduct "the amount spent on the acquisition of the invalid title procured by him with the acquiescence of the Yupanos." This requires a further determination of what constitutes legitimate "expenses" and what constitutes "acquiescence" by the Yupanos, potentially leading to further litigation.
*   **Restoration of Original Title:** The SC ordered the Register of Deeds of Makati to CANCEL Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. 156312 and 156313 in the name of Laureano Yupano and, in lieu thereof, RESTORE Transfer Certificate No. 155768. This title may need to be updated to reflect the transfer of ownership of Cornelia Baladad or her estate.

**Case Law:**

*   **Abad v. Guimba (G.R. No. 157002, July 29, 2005):** Duty of a purchaser to investigate beyond the face of the title when circumstances warrant.

**Conclusion:**
The Court held that the sale between Sergio Rublico and the Spouses Yupano is invalid.
