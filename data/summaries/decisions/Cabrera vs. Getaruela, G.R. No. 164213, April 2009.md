## Legal Document Summary - Cabrera v. Getaruela, G.R. No. 164213

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's decision partially reversing the MTCC's judgment in an ejectment case (unlawful detainer). The Supreme Court denied the Petition and Affirmed the CA decision.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Valentin Cabrera, Manuel Cabrera, and Rebecca Leslie Cabras.
*   **Respondents:** Elizabeth Getaruela, et al., heirs of Urbana Jaca Ababon.

**Subject Matter:**  Lot Nos. 3635-CC and 3635-Y, located in Cebu City.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Unlawful Detainer:** SC affirmed that the complaint sufficiently alleged a cause of action for unlawful detainer, establishing initial possession by tolerance of the respondents (plaintiffs), subsequent illegal possession upon demand to vacate, continued possession, and filing of the complaint within one year of the last demand. *Fernando v. Lim* (G.R. No. 176282, 2008) is cited regarding the elements of unlawful detainer.
*   **Jurisdiction:** SC held that the allegations in the complaint and the relief sought determine the court's jurisdiction. Defenses raised in the answer are not determinative. The MTCC had jurisdiction. *Larano v. Calendacion* (G.R. No. 158231, 2007) is referenced in relation to determination of jurisdiction.
*   **Ownership vs. Possession:** While the issue in an unlawful detainer case is primarily physical possession (possession *de facto*), courts can provisionally rule on ownership to determine the right to possess. *Pascual v. Coronel* (G.R. No. 159292, 2007) clarifies the provisional nature of ownership determination.
*   **Superceding Documents**: SC upheld the lower court's factual finding that the court-approved Repartition Project superseded the earlier "Kasabutan nga Hinigala". This ruling is based on deference to factual findings of lower courts.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioners are obligated to vacate Lot No. 3635-CC, remove improvements, and surrender possession to the respondents.

**Liabilities:**

*   The MTCC previously ordered, but it's unclear if this liability stands after appeals, the petitioners to jointly and severally pay attorney's fees and litigation expenses.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Provisional Nature of Ownership Determination:** The ownership determination in this ejectment case is *provisional*. Petitioners retain the right to file a separate action to definitively settle the issue of title. This is highlighted as the Repartition Project seemingly conflicts with the "Kasabutan nga Hinigala."
*   **Factual Disputes:** Underlying the legal issues are factual disputes regarding the validity and interpretation of the Repartition Project and the "Kasabutan nga Hinigala." While SC deferred to the lower courts' factual findings, these remain potential points of contention.
* **Sale of Urbana Jaca Ababon's share:** The RTC initially erroneously ruled that Urbana Jaca Ababon sold her share, later clarifying it was Panfilo Jaca who sold his share. This inconsistency could cause further confusion and complicate the resolution of ownership.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Governs petitions for review to the Supreme Court.
*   **Fernando v. Lim, G.R. No. 176282, 22 August 2008:**  Defines elements of unlawful detainer.
*   **Larano v. Calendacion, G.R. No. 158231, 19 June 2007:** Deals with the determination of court jurisdiction.
*   **Pascual v. Coronel, G.R. No. 159292, 12 July 2007:**  Explains the provisional nature of ownership determination in ejectment cases.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** None specific, but the underlying factual disputes and the provisional nature of the ownership ruling create ongoing potential for further litigation.
