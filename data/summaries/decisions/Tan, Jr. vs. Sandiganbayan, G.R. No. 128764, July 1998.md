## Legal Document Summary: *Bienvenido Tan, Jr. vs. Sandiganbayan* (G.R. No. 128764)

This case involves a petition for *certiorari* filed by Bienvenido Tan, Jr., former Commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), challenging the Sandiganbayan's denial of his Motion to Quash the Information filed against him for violations of Section 3(e) and (g) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (R.A. 3019).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Charges:** Violation of Section 3(e) (causing undue injury to the government or giving unwarranted benefit through evident bad faith or manifest partiality) and 3(g) (entering into a manifestly and grossly disadvantageous contract on behalf of the government) of R.A. 3019.
*   **Specific Allegation:** As BIR Commissioner, Tan allegedly conspired with others (initially including San Miguel Corporation executives) to compromise the tax liabilities of San Miguel Corporation (SMC) by accepting only Php10,000,000.00 in settlement of a Php302,951,048.93 liability, causing undue injury to the government.
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   Tan and co-accused moved for reinvestigation, which was granted.
    *   Special Prosecutor recommended dismissal of charges against all co-accused except Tan, which the Sandiganbayan granted.
    *   Tan then filed a Motion to Quash (referred to as Motion to Dismiss in the document) the Information, arguing that the dismissal of charges against his co-accused negates the alleged conspiracy.
    *   Sandiganbayan denied the Motion to Quash.
    *   Tan filed a petition for *certiorari* to the Supreme Court without filing a Motion for Reconsideration with the Sandiganbayan.

**Court's Holding & Reasoning:**

The Supreme Court **dismissed** Tan's petition, finding no grave abuse of discretion by the Sandiganbayan. The Court's reasoning included:

1.  **Procedural Defects:** Tan failed to exhaust available remedies by not filing a Motion for Reconsideration with the Sandiganbayan, and *certiorari* is not the proper remedy for denial of a motion to quash, unless there is a grave abuse of discretion. *See Ongsitco v. CA, 325 Phil. 1069; Lalican v. Vergara, G.R. No. 108679.* The proper procedure is to proceed to trial and appeal any adverse judgement.
2.  **Valid Information:** The Information validly alleges all the elements of the offenses under Section 3(e) and (g) of R.A. 3019.  *See R.A. 3019, Section 3(e) and (g).* Conspiracy is not an essential element of these crimes and its allegation was merely to show how the accused incurred liability. Dismissal of charges against co-conspirators does not invalidate the Information against Tan.
3.  **No Double Jeopardy:** Amending the information would not result in double jeopardy, as Tan was not previously convicted, acquitted, or the case dismissed without his express consent.
4.  **Prosecutorial Discretion:** The Court will not interfere with the Ombudsman's discretion on who to prosecute, citing the principle of independence and the need to avoid reviewing discretionary prosecutorial decisions. *See Alba v. Hon. Nitorreda, 325 Phil. 229.*
5.  **Waiver:** Tan waived his right to quash based on the dropping of the charge against a co-accused as the Motion to Quash was filed late.

**Potential Liabilities & Risks for Tan:**

*   **Potential Conviction under R.A. 3019, Section 3(e) and (g):** Tan remains exposed to criminal liability if the prosecution can prove beyond reasonable doubt that he caused undue injury to the government or gave unwarranted benefit to SMC through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence, or entered into a manifestly and grossly disadvantageous contract.
*   **Defense Strategy:** Tan's argument of reliance on subordinates is a matter of defense to be proven at trial.
*   **Impact of Co-Accused's Exoneration:** While his co-accused were exonerated, Tan remains accountable individually based on his actions as the Commissioner.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Section 3(e) and 3(g).
*   Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 110, Section 2; Rule 117, Section 3, 8.

**Key Case Law:**

*   *Ongsitco v. CA, 325 Phil. 1069* (Certiorari requirements).
*   *Lalican v. Vergara, G.R. No. 108679* (Certiorari not proper remedy for denial of Motion to Quash).
*   *Alba v. Hon. Nitorreda, 325 Phil. 229* (Prosecutorial discretion).
*   *Socrates v. Sandiganbayan, 324 Phil. 151* (Requirements for double jeopardy, discretion of prosecutor)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Evident Bad Faith" and "Manifest Partiality":** These are subjective terms that will require strong evidence to prove. The prosecution must demonstrate how Tan's actions specifically meet these criteria.
*   **"Grossly Disadvantageous":** The prosecution must convincingly show that the compromise agreement was indeed grossly disadvantageous to the government. The defense will likely argue that it was a reasonable compromise under the circumstances.
*   **Causation**: The prosecution must establish a causal link between Tan's actions and the undue injury allegedly suffered by the government.

**Legal Advice:**

Advise the client to prepare a strong defense strategy focusing on:

1.  **Challenging the elements of Section 3(e) and (g):**  Disprove any *mala fides*, and lack of causation.
2.  **Presenting evidence of good faith:** Evidence showing that the compromise agreement was reasonable and made in the best interests of the government, given the circumstances.
3.  **Demonstrating reliance on subordinates:** Presenting evidence that Tan reasonably relied on the recommendations of his subordinates, which were not manifestly erroneous or tainted with bad faith.
4.  Prepare for a full trial.

The client must be prepared for a potentially lengthy and complex legal battle.
