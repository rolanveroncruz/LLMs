**Legal Document Summary: *Moslares v. Court of Appeals and Toyota Bel-Air, Inc.***

**Case:** G.R. No. 129744, June 26, 1998

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the trial court's conviction of Petitioner for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 Violation:** Petitioner issued a check that was dishonored due to insufficient funds, leading to criminal charges. The central issue revolves around whether Petitioner can be held personally liable for the offense.
*   **Right to Present Evidence:** The trial court declared Petitioner to have waived his right to present evidence due to multiple postponements. The Supreme Court found this to be a violation of due process, given the context of justified postponements and willingness of the defense to present witnesses.
*   **Right to Appeal:** The lower courts denied Petitioner's appeal based on a supposed waiver due to his absence during promulgation, citing *People vs. Mapalao*. The Supreme Court distinguished *Mapalao*, stating that the right to appeal is not lost if perfected within the 15-day reglementary period, and the accused is not a fugitive.
*   **Right to Bail:** The Court of Appeals denied bail based on the finality of the trial court's decision, which was based on the denial of the appeal. The Supreme Court found this erroneous, emphasizing the constitutional guarantee of bail for offenses not punishable by death, reclusion perpetua, or life imprisonment.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** The primary risk is the imposition of the penalty of imprisonment for violating B.P. Blg. 22.
*   **Corporate Officer Liability:** The court mentions the issue of holding a corporate officer criminally liable for signing a bum check, a point raised by the Solicitor General citing *Lina Lim Lao vs. Court of Appeals*.
*   **Financial Liability:** Although not explicitly detailed, the underlying transaction involves a significant sum (P1,425,780.00), implying potential civil liability for the amount of the dishonored check.

*   The justification for the postponements, while accepted by the Supreme Court, may be subject to re-examination in the remanded proceedings.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the Petitioner was denied due process. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings, specifically to allow the Petitioner to present evidence and to be considered for bail. The central issue is the liability of a corporate officer for a bouncing check, with the procedural issues of right to present evidence and right to appeal being critical in the outcome.
