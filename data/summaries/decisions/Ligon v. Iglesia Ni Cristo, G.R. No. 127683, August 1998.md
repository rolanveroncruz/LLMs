## Legal Document Summary: *Leticia P. Ligon v. Court of Appeals and Iglesia Ni Cristo*

**Case:** G.R. No. 127683, August 7, 1998 (355 Phil. 503)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65, Rules of Court) challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 40258, which annulled the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) partial judgment in Civil Case No. Q-91-10494.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Leticia P. Ligon (LIGON), mortgagee.
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals and Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC), purchaser of mortgaged property.

**Factual Background:**

*   LIGON held three mortgages over land owned by the Islamic Directorate of the Philippines (IDP), executed by individuals allegedly representing IDP.
*   INC purchased the land from a faction of IDP (Carpizo Group), but IDP failed to evict squatters as per the sale agreement.
*   INC sued IDP for specific performance (Civil Case No. Q-90-6937).
*   The Tamano group filed a petition with SEC to annul the sale of the two lots to INC.(SEC Case No. 4012) which the SEC granted.
*   INC filed a special civil action for certiorari before the Court of Appeals, which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 33295. The Court of Appeals granted INCâ€™s petition and set aside the portion of the SEC decision declaring the sale null and void.
*   INC then sued LIGON to annul the mortgages (Civil Case No. Q-91-10494), claiming they were invalid.
*   LIGON filed a cross-claim against IDP for foreclosure. IDP was declared in default for failure to answer the cross-claim.
*   RTC granted LIGON's motion to present evidence ex-parte and subsequently issued a partial judgment in favor of LIGON ordering foreclosure.
*   INC, despite not being a party to the cross-claim, moved for reconsideration, which was denied.
*   INC filed a petition for certiorari with the CA (CA-G.R. SP No. 40258), challenging the RTC's partial judgment and the order denying their motion for reconsideration.
*   The CA ruled in favor of INC, finding that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in rendering a partial judgment without allowing INC to present its evidence on the validity of the mortgages.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Indispensable Party (IDP):** LIGON argued that IDP was an indispensable party in CA-G.R. SP No. 40258 and should have been impleaded.  The Supreme Court (SC) disagreed, noting that IDP was an aggrieved party in the challenged partial decision and not interested in sustaining it as per Rule 65, Section 5 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Default of IDP:** The SC found that the RTC improperly declared IDP in default because IDP's answer with a cross-claim had already joined the subsidiary issues between the co-parties regarding the validity of the mortgages, rendering a separate answer to LIGON's cross-claim superfluous. Cites Rule 6, Sec. 7 of the Rules of Court for the definition of a cross-claim.
*   **INC's Aggrievement:** The SC held that INC was an aggrieved party because the partial judgment resolved the central issue of the validity of the mortgages against them without allowing them to present evidence. The dismissal of the petition was of no benifit to INC because of the decision in G.R. No. 117897 declaring null and void the sale of the IDP properties to INC.
*   **Forum Shopping:** The SC ruled that INC did not engage in forum shopping because the different cases involved different transactions, issues, and reliefs sought. Cites *Washington Distillers, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 260 SCRA 821, 835 [1996]* for the definition of forum shopping.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Sections 1 and 5, Rules of Court:** Pertaining to parties in certiorari actions.
*   **Rule 6, Section 7 (now Section 8), Rules of Court:** Definition of a cross-claim.
*   **G.R. No. 117897 (Islamic Directorate of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals):**  Decision declaring the sale of the IDP properties to INC as null and void *ab initio*. Section 40 of the Corporation Code.
*   **Rule 3, Section 7 of the Rules of Court:** Compulsory Joinder of Indispensable Parties.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Mortgages:** The SC's decision in this case does not determine the validity of the mortgages held by LIGON. This issue remains to be resolved in Civil Case No. Q-91-10494.
*   **Interest Rate:** The RTC partial judgment ordered IDP to pay LIGON amounts "with interest at 36% per annum compounded annually." The validity and enforceability of this high interest rate is a potential area of contention.
*   **Impact of G.R. No. 117897:**  The declaration of the sale to INC as void *ab initio* renders INC's position in Civil Case No. Q-91-10494 questionable, although it has technically not had its say on the validity of the original mortgage.
*   **Carpizo Group's Authority:** Validity of the mortgages depends on whether those who executed the mortgages for IDP had the actual or apparent authority to do so. The SC in G.R. No. 117897 deemed the Carpizo Group a "fake Board," raising questions about all transactions they entered into.

**Conclusion:**

The SC dismissed LIGON's petition, upholding the CA's decision to set aside the RTC's partial judgment. While the decision clarifies the procedural issues surrounding the IDP's default and INC's standing, the core issue of the validity of the mortgages remains unresolved and subject to further litigation. The SC's ruling in G.R. No. 117897 further complicates the situation and raises the potential for Ligon to be unable to collect on the mortgage.
