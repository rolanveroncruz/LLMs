**Case Summary: *Re: Unauthorized Absences from the Post of Pearl Marie N. Icamina*, A.M. No. P-06-2137 (2008)**

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Pearl Marie N. Icamina, Legal Researcher, for frequent unauthorized absences (loafing) from duty during regular office hours.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Violation:** Icamina found guilty of loafing/frequent unauthorized absences, a grave offense under Rule IV, Section 52(A)(17) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (Uniform Rules), also referencing Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 991936.
*   **Evidence:** The Court relied heavily on logbook entries kept by security guards, documenting Icamina's frequent departures from and returns to the office premises during working hours. The Court found these departures were almost daily and lasted from 30 minutes to two hours, sometimes multiple times a day.
*   **Defenses Rejected:** Icamina's explanations that she was conducting legal research at the RTC, IBP, and Aklan Catholic College libraries were deemed insufficient. The RTC and IBP libraries were within the Hall of Justice, making the recorded departures questionable.  No evidence supported her claim of researching at the Aklan Catholic College library.
*   **Mitigating Circumstance:**  Icamina's length of service (approximately 20 years) was considered a mitigating circumstance under Section 53(j), Rule IV of the Uniform Rules.
*   **Penalty:**  Suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day without pay. A warning was issued regarding future similar infractions.

**Obligations:**

*   Court personnel have an obligation to observe prescribed office hours and devote their time to public service (Administrative Circular No. 2-99, Section 1, Canon IV of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel).
*   Complainant, as clerk of court, has the obligation to manage the office and ensure the attendance and diligence of the staff.

**Liabilities:**

*   Icamina is held administratively liable for loafing.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Frequent":** The case references *Grutas v. Madolaria*, *Lopena v. Saloma*, and *Office of the Court Administrator v. Mallare* for the definition of "frequent" as "absent[ing] themselves from duty more than once."  The definition is seemingly broad.
*   **Standard of Evidence:** "Substantial evidence" is the standard used to prove the charge.  The reliance on logbook entries as primary evidence raises questions about potential inaccuracies or biases in record-keeping.
*   **Ambiguity of Reason for Leaving:** The Court rejected Icamina's claims that the excursions related to research activities. Depending on the specific job description of a Legal Researcher, ambiguity could arise in a future similar case regarding permissible research activities outside of a primary office.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Rule IV, Section 52(A)(17):** Defines loafing as a grave offense.
*   **Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 991936:** Relates to administrative penalties for unauthorized absences.
*   **CONSTITUTION, Art. XI, Sec. 1:** Public office is a public trust.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 2-99:**  Establishes standard court office hours.
*   **Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, Section 1, Canon IV:** Outlines conduct and duties of Court personnel.
*   ***Grutas v. Madolaria, Lopena v. Saloma, Office of the Court Administrator v. Mallare***:  Defined frequency of unauthorized absences.
