**Case:** *Atty. Benigno Bartolome v. Atty. Christopher A. Basilio*, A.C. No. 10783, January 31, 2018 (824 Phil. 833)

**Summary:**

This Supreme Court Resolution concerns the Motion to Lift Suspension filed by Atty. Basilio, previously suspended for one year in *Bartolome v. Basilio* (771 Phil. 1 [2015]) due to violations of the 2004 Rules of Notarial Practice and Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. The court is reviewing whether to lift the suspension and whether additional penalties are warranted for Basilio's delay in complying with the original suspension order.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Original Decision (October 14, 2015):** Basilio was suspended from the practice of law for one year, his notarial commission revoked, and he was prohibited from being commissioned as a notary public for two years, "effective immediately."
*   **Respondent's Argument:** Basilio argued that the suspension was held in abeyance pending the resolution of his Motion for Reconsideration, citing *Maniago v. De Dios* (631 Phil. 139 [2010]). He also contended that only the revocation of his notarial commission was immediately executory.
*   **OBC's Recommendation:** The Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) recommended a P10,000 fine for Basilio's failure to immediately comply with the suspension order.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Court found Basilio guilty of indirect contempt for failing to immediately serve his suspension.
*   **Date of Receipt:** The court explicitly stated that "effective immediately" meant ALL penalties imposed on Basilio commenced on the date he received the Decision on December 2, 2015.
*   **Sanctions:** The court imposes a fine of P10,000 on Basilio for indirect contempt. Lifting of the suspension is held in abeyance pending payment and proof thereof.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Indirect Contempt:** Basilio is found liable for indirect contempt for failing to immediately comply with the suspension order.
*   **Monetary Liability:** Basilio must pay a fine of P10,000.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Further Disciplinary Action:** The decision warns of more severe consequences for any future similar infractions.
*   **Delayed Reinstatement:** Lifting of the suspension is contingent on the payment of the fine, which could delay his reinstatement to the practice of law.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **2004 Rules of Notarial Practice:** Violated by Basilio.
*   **Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** Violated by Basilio.
*   ***Maniago v. De Dios*** **(631 Phil. 139 [2010]):** Cited by Basilio but distinguished by the Court.
*   **Bartolome v. Basilio, 771 Phil. 1 (2015):** The original case that led to Basilio's suspension.
*   **Capitol Hills Golf and Country Club v. Sanchez, 728 Phil. 58, 69 [2014]:** The court cited this to state that A person guilty of disobedience of or resistance to a lawful order of a court or commits any improper conduct tending, directly or indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice may be punished for indirect contempt.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "effective immediately" was the central point of contention. Basilio argued it only applied to the notarial commission penalties, while the Court unequivocally stated it applied to the suspension from practice as well.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court strongly affirms the immediate effectivity of its orders and punishes the respondent for failing to comply promptly. The decision underscores the importance of adhering to court orders and provides a warning against selective interpretation of penalties. The imposition of indirect contempt and the fine demonstrate the Court's commitment to enforcing its disciplinary powers.
