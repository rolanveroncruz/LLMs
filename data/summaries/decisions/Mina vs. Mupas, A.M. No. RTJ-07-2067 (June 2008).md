**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-07-2067 (Nilo Jay Mina vs. Judge Jesus B. Mupas)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against a judge for undue delay in resolving motions.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Complainant, Nilo Jay Mina, alleged dereliction of duties, grave misconduct, manifest partiality, and violation of the Constitution and the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act against Judge Jesus B. Mupas. The core of the complaint is the undue delay in resolving an Urgent Motion to Declare All Defendants in Default and two Motions to Dismiss.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Judge Mupas admitted the delay but claimed it was inadvertent and excusable due to handling two branches, including a special commercial court. He argued the complainant should have filed a motion to resolve instead of an administrative complaint.
*   **OCA Finding:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) found Judge Mupas administratively liable for violating Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct (prompt disposition of court business).
*   **Investigating Justice Finding:** The Investigating Justice found Judge Mupas guilty of delay, rejecting his additional assignments as an excuse. The charge of partiality was dismissed.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Investigating Justice's findings, holding Judge Mupas administratively liable for undue delay, citing *Art. VIII, Section 15 (1) of the 1987 Constitution* regarding prompt resolution of cases. Additional workload isn't a valid excuse; a judge should request extensions.

**Obligations:**

*   Judges are obligated to resolve motions and cases within the timeframe prescribed by the *Constitution* (Section 15, Article VIII, 1987 Constitution) and the *Rules of Court*.
*   The *New Code of Judicial Conduct* and *Code of Judicial Conduct* mandate efficient, fair, and prompt performance of judicial duties (Canon 6, Section 5 of the New Code and Rule 3.05).
*   Judges must request extensions if workload prevents timely disposition.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Mupas was found guilty of undue delay in rendering an order.
*   Sanction: Fined P10,000.00, with a stern warning against future delays.
*   Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC, classifies "undue delay in rendering a decision or order, or in transmitting the records of a case" as a less serious charge.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in "Inadvertence":** Judge Mupas's claim of "inadvertence" might be scrutinized in other cases. Habitual or egregious delays cannot be excused simply as inadvertence.
*   **Reliance on Mitigating Factors:** The relatively light penalty hinges heavily on mitigating factors: heavy caseload, additional assignment, admission of inadvertence, and first offense of this *nature* in his service. The previous reprimand for failure to supervise staff *wasn't* considered the same nature.
*   **Impact of Precedent:** This case reinforces the SC's stance against judicial delay. It also clarifies that claiming heavy workload is insufficient defense without seeking extensions.
*   **Failure to Supervise Staff:** Judge Mupas was previously reprimanded in MTJ-95-1067, entitled "Tierry Aro v. Judge Jesus Mupas," for Failure to Supervise Staff and Unjust Dismissal, per OCA Report dated June 4, 2007, rollo, p. 3.
