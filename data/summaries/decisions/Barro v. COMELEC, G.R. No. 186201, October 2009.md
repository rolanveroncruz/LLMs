## Legal Document Summary - *Barro v. COMELEC* (G.R. No. 186201)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64, questioning COMELEC First Division orders dismissing an appeal in a *Punong Barangay* election protest.

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Election Protest:** Private Respondent (Continedas, Jr.) filed an election protest with the MTC Palompon, Leyte, after Petitioner (Barro) won by one vote.
*   **MTC Decision:** After revision, MTC found a tie (151 votes each) and ordered drawing of lots.
*   **Petitioner's Appeal:** Petitioner filed a Notice of Appeal with the MTC and allegedly paid the P1,000 appeal fee under A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC (Rules of Procedure in Election Contests). Receipt was not attached to the record.
*   **COMELEC Dismissal:** COMELEC First Division dismissed the appeal due to non-payment of the P3,000 appeal fee required under COMELEC Rules of Procedure (Rules 40, Sections 3 and 4 and Rule 22, Section 9(a)).
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration and belatedly tendered P3,200 via postal money order.  The COMELEC First Division denied this motion, citing non-payment of motion fees.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Grave Abuse of Discretion by COMELEC First Division in Dismissing the Appeal:** Did the COMELEC err in dismissing the appeal for non-payment of the additional P3,200 appeal fee when the initial appeal fee of P1,000 was paid to the MTC?
2.  **Grave Abuse of Discretion by COMELEC First Division in Denying the Motion for Reconsideration Without Elevating to the En Banc:** Did the COMELEC err in ruling on the MR instead of referring it to the COMELEC *en banc*?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition. Orders of the COMELEC First Division and the Entry of Judgment were **ANNULLED and SET ASIDE**, remanding the case for disposition in accordance with the Decision.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Issue 1 (Dismissal of Appeal):**  The Supreme Court relied on *Jerry B. Aguilar v. COMELEC* (G.R. No. 185140, June 30, 2009). It determined that the appeal was perfected when the notice of appeal and P1,000 fee were filed with the MTC.  The promulgation of COMELEC Resolution No. 8486 (clarifying appeal fee rules) *after* the appeal was perfected meant the COMELEC should have first directed Petitioner to pay the additional P3,200 fee *before* dismissing the appeal.  Dismissing the appeal outright was a grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Issue 2 (Motion for Reconsideration):** The COMELEC First Division violated Section 7, Article IX-A and Section 3, Article IX-C of the Constitution and COMELEC Rules (Sections 5 and 6, Rule 19) by ruling on the motion for reconsideration instead of elevating it to the *en banc*. This was deemed an exercise of jurisdiction without authority, rendering the order denying the MR void.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Art. IX-A, Sec. 7 & Art. IX-C, Sec. 3:** Pertains to the resolution of election cases by the COMELEC and the requirement that motions for reconsideration of decisions shall be decided by the Commission *en banc*.
*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 19, Sections 5 and 6:** Reflect the Constitutional requirement that MRs be decided by the *en banc*.
*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 40, Sections 3 and 4 & Rule 22, Section 9(a):** Pertains to payment of appeal fees in COMELEC and grounds for dismissal of appeal, respectively.
*   **A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC, Rule 14, Sections 8 and 9:** Rules of Procedure in Election Contests Before Courts, regarding appeal procedure and fees.
*   ***Aguilar v. COMELEC*** (G.R. No. 185140, June 30, 2009): Critical case clarifying appeal fee requirements and COMELEC discretion.
*   ***Divinagracia v. COMELEC*** (G.R. Nos. 186007 & 186016, July 27, 2009): Establishes that after this case, errors in appeal fee payments are no longer excusable.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Missing Receipt:** The lack of a receipt showing payment of the P1,000 appeal fee to the MTC could be problematic on remand. The Court presumes payment based on the MTC giving due course to the appeal, but proof will be required.
*   **Reliance on Aguilar:** The application of *Aguilar* is crucial. The Supreme Court explicitly links this case to the decision.  If the facts are distinguishable on remand, the COMELEC could argue for a different outcome.

**Summary for a Lawyer:**

This case involves a successful challenge to the COMELEC First Division's dismissal of an election appeal based on technicalities relating to appeal fee payments. The Supreme Court found grave abuse of discretion, relying heavily on *Aguilar v. COMELEC*, because the COMELEC enforced a subsequent clarification of appeal fee rules retroactively without giving the appellant a chance to comply. The Court also held that the First Division erred in denying the motion for reconsideration; it was required to refer it to the *en banc*. The key risk is the lack of documentary evidence for the initial P1,000 payment. The case also highlights the importance of clarifying administrative rules and applying them prospectively, especially in election matters.
