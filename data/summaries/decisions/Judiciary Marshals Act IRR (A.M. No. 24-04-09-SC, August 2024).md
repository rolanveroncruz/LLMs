*   Potential liability for unlawful arrests, searches, or seizures if procedures are not strictly followed.
*   Potential liability for violations of the Data Privacy Act.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Overreach of Authority:** The OJM's investigative powers, particularly those related to accessing private records, could lead to potential abuses if not strictly controlled and supervised by the Supreme Court.  Emphasis on *explicit* authorization from the Supreme Court is crucial to avoid overreach.
*   **Conflicts of Interest:**  Investigations of fellow court personnel could present conflicts of interest and require careful management.
*   **Data Privacy Violations:**  Access to sensitive personal information during investigations creates a risk of data breaches or misuse, requiring strict adherence to data privacy laws.
*   **Coordination Issues:** Potential for conflicts or overlap with other law enforcement agencies due to concurrent jurisdiction.  Requires clearly defined protocols for coordination.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **"Other related functions" (Rule III, Sec. 1(g), Sec. 17):** This is a sweeping phrase that should be clearly limited to functions in-line with the Act to avoid mission creep. This may lead to the OJM being tasked with assignments that aren't in-line with the legislative intent of protecting the judiciary.
*   **The power of investigation given under Section 7, Rule III should be explicitly authorized for each specific activity.** It should be clarified the grounds for which a power to investigate should be granted.

*   Establish robust data security measures to comply with the Data Privacy Act.
