## Legal Document Summary: *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Dando*

**Case:** G.R. No. 177456, September 4, 2009

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review of Court of Appeals decision annulling the RTC's Orders which set aside the dismissal of a collection case due to the late filing of a pre-trial brief.

**Facts:** BPI (successor to FEBTC) sued Dando to collect on a loan. BPI filed its pre-trial brief on the day of the pre-trial conference, violating Rule 18, Sections 5 and 6 of the Rules of Court, which require filing at least three days prior. The RTC initially dismissed the case, but later reconsidered and set it for trial. The CA reversed, holding the RTC abused its discretion.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 18, Sections 5 and 6 of the Rules of Court:** Mandates the filing of pre-trial briefs at least three days before the pre-trial conference. Failure to file is equivalent to failure to appear, leading to dismissal for the plaintiff.
*   **Obligation to Pay Loan:** Dando's obligation to repay the loan availed from FEBTC, now under BPI.
*   **Discretion to Relax Rules:** While procedural rules are generally mandatory, courts have the discretion to relax them in certain circumstances to promote substantial justice.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **BPI's Risk:** Dismissal of the case with prejudice due to the failure to comply with the Rules of Court, precluding the recovery of the loan.
*   **Dando's Risk:** Being held liable for the outstanding loan amount, including interests and penalties if the case proceeds and BPI succeeds.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 18, Sections 5 and 6 of the Rules of Court:** Regarding pre-trial briefs and the consequences of failure to comply.
*   **Case Law on Relaxation of Procedural Rules:** *Sanchez v. Court of Appeals*, 452 Phil. 665 (2003), outlines factors justifying suspension of strict adherence to procedural rules. *Barranco v. Commission on the Settlement of Land Problems, G.R. No. 168990, 16 June 2006* discusses the right of the parties to be heard.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Justification for Late Filing:** The excuse of "heavy pressures of work" is deemed insufficient by the Court of Appeals.
*   **Application of Discretion:** The main issue is whether the RTC properly exercised its discretion in relaxing the procedural rules despite BPI's non-compliance.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED BPI's Petition and REINSTATED the RTC's orders that overturned the dismissal. The court emphasized that technicalities should not override the pursuit of substantial justice, especially in matters of property. The court reasoned BPI's procedural lapse was the first and only one, and that Dando would not be prejudiced by continuing the case, and would be unjustly enriched if the case did not proceed.

**Legal Analysis:**

*   The Court balanced the mandatory nature of procedural rules against the need for substantial justice.
*   The Court emphasized Dando's admission of the loan and the unjust enrichment that would result from dismissing the case.
*   The Court considered that this was BPI's first offense and a strict application of the rules would strip BPI of it's right to claim the amount due.
