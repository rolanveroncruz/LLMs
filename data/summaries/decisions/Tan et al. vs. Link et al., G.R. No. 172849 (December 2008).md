**Case Summary: _Tan v. Link_, G.R. No. 172849, December 10, 2008 (594 Phil. 138)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) dismissal of a complaint for "Action Reindivicatoria, Damages, Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus with Prayer for Writ of Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction and Restraining Order." The core issue is whether the RTC correctly denied the Petitioners' appeal due to late payment of docket fees and lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Sale of Land:** Respondent Link sold land to Petitioners (FBMPC and Almocera) via Deed of Absolute Sale dated April 2, 2002. Title remained in Link's name.
*   **CARP Coverage:** Land subject to Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) under RA 6657.
*   **Land Valuation:** Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) valued properties; Link filed for valuation with Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB).
*   **DARAB Proceedings:** Petitioners intervened in DARAB proceedings, claiming ownership. DARAB denied their claim and directed LBP to pay Link just compensation.
*   **RTC Complaint:** Petitioners filed an action with the RTC seeking to reverse the DARAB orders, alleging grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Motion to Dismiss:** Respondent Link moved to dismiss the RTC case, citing lack of jurisdiction, failure to state a cause of action, lack of appellate jurisdiction, and forum shopping.
*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC granted the motion to dismiss finding it lacks jurisdiction.
*  **Docket Fees**: The CA affirmed the RTC decision citing late payment of docket fees.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (FBMPC, Almocera, Tan):** Obligation to timely pay docket fees for appeal.
*   **Respondent Link:** Entitled to just compensation as determined by DARAB.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP):** Obligation to pay just compensation to Link as directed by DARAB.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Late Payment of Docket Fees:** The CA and Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the appeal due to failure to pay docket fees within the prescribed period under Rule 41, Section 4 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. *Jose v. Court of Appeals, 447 Phil. 159, 165 (2003)* This raises potential malpractice concerns if counsel failed to advise/ensure timely payment.
*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** The RTC lacked jurisdiction over the matter, as it involved an agrarian dispute falling under the primary and exclusive jurisdiction of the DARAB. *Islanders CARP-Farmers Beneficiaries Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Inc. v. Lapanday Agricultural and Development Corporation G.R. No. 159089, 3 May 2006*. The CA correctly pointed out that the proper recourse was a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court to the CA, as specified in DARAB Rules of Procedure, Rule XIV, Section 1. The ruling is *without prejudice to the filing of the proper case at the RTC to determine the issue of ownership*. This could lead to further litigation.
*   **Ownership Dispute:** While the core issue revolved around jurisdiction and procedural rules, the underlying dispute regarding ownership of the land between Link and the Petitioners remained unresolved.
*   **CARP Implementation:** The fact that the land was subject to CARP introduces complexities related to agrarian reform law and potential farmer-beneficiary rights.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law - CARL):** Governs the land acquisition and distribution process.
*   **Rule 41, Section 4, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Mandates timely payment of appellate docket fees.
*   **2002 DARAB Rules of Procedure, Section 1, Rule II:** Grants DARAB primary and exclusive jurisdiction over agrarian disputes.
*   **2002 DARAB Rules of Procedure, Rule XIV, Section 1**: Provides for Certiorari to the Court of Appeals for DARAB decisions.
*   **Islanders CARP-Farmers Beneficiaries Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Inc. v. Lapanday Agricultural and Development Corporation G.R. No. 159089, 3 May 2006, 489 SCRA 80**: Affirms primary jurisdiction of DAR over CARP implementation controversies.
*   **KLT Fruits, Inc. v. WSR Fruits, Inc., G.R. No. 174219, 23 November 2007, 538 SCRA 713**: Exceptions to the stringent rule of timely payment of appellate docket fees.
*  **Jose v. Court of Appeals, 447 Phil. 159, 165 (2003)**: Failure to pay docket and other lawful fees within the prescribed period is a ground for the dismissal of an appeal

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Deed of Absolute Sale appears to state 2002, while the Petitioners allege they acquired the parcels of land as early as 1995.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of the appeal due to late payment of docket fees and lack of jurisdiction. Petitioners' failure to perfect their appeal timely deprived the CA of jurisdiction. While the decision focuses on procedural issues, the unresolved underlying ownership dispute warrants attention and may lead to further litigation in the RTC.
