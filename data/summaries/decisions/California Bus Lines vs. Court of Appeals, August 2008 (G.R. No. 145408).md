**Case Summary: California Bus Lines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. No. 145408 (August 20, 2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 challenging CA resolutions, an Alias Writ of Execution, and a Compromise Agreement, all related to an ejectment case.

**Facts:**
*   MIAA filed an ejectment suit against CBL in MTC; MTC ruled in favor of MIAA. CBL failed to appeal, judgment became final.
*   Parties entered into a Compromise Agreement, approved by the MTC.
*   CBL failed to comply with the Compromise Agreement, prompting MIAA to seek an Alias Writ of Execution.
*   CBL challenged the writ in RTC and CA, arguing that the Compromise Agreement was invalid and execution was prescribed.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Validity of Compromise Agreement:** CBL argued the agreement improperly modified a final judgment.
*   **Prescription of Execution:** CBL contended the motion for Alias Writ of Execution was filed beyond the 5-year period.
*   **Propriety of Rule 65 Petition:** MIAA challenged the use of certiorari to review a CA decision.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** CBL challenged the increase in attorneys fees in the compromise agreement in excess of 20,000 pesos.

**Court's Holding:**

*   **Improper Remedy:**  The Supreme Court (SC) held that CBL should have appealed the CA decision via Rule 45 (Petition for Review on Certiorari), not Rule 65 (Certiorari).  The Court reiterated the principle that certiorari is available only when there is no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
*   **Validity of Compromise Agreement Upheld:** The SC acknowledged that courts can modify judgments even after they become final if circumstances render execution unjust.  The Compromise Agreement was deemed voluntarily entered into and beneficial to both parties. *Aboitiz Shipping Employees Asso. v. Trajano, 278 SCRA 387 and Cabrias v. Adil, 135 SCRA 354.*
*   **Execution Not Prescribed:**  The Court ruled that CBL's repeated legal challenges acted as a *suspension* of the 5-year period to execute the judgment by motion.  *Camacho v. Court of Appeals, 287 SCRA 611.*
*   **Attorney Fees were Valid:** CBL's argument of attorney's fees in excess of 20,000 pesos was incorrect because the attorney fees were mandated when the trail court awards the attorney's fees absent any valid stipulation between the parties relative thereto. *Art. 1306 of the Civil Code*.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   CBL remains liable for the obligations under the Compromise Agreement.
*   Further delays could result in additional penalties or interest.
*   The Court noted CBL's "unjustifiable use of the processes of our legal system." This suggests a risk of future sanctions for frivolous appeals.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the court upheld the agreement, specific terms of the Compromise Agreement (payment schedule, ongoing rental rates) are not detailed in this summary and should be reviewed for potential ambiguities.
