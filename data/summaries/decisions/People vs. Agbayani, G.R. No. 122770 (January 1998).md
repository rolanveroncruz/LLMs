## Legal Document Summary: People v. Agbayani, G.R. No. 122770 (1998)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Automatic Review due to Death Penalty)

**Subject Matter:** Rape (Incestuous)

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Accusation:** Accused Eduardo Agbayani was charged with rape by his 14-year-old daughter, Eden Agbayani, under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) as amended by R.A. 7659.
*   **Penalty:** Trial court imposed the death penalty due to the victim being under 18 and the offender being the victim's parent, pursuant to R.A. 7659.
*   **Defense:** Accused pleaded not guilty, presented alibi (visiting daughter in Pangasinan), and introduced an affidavit of desistance from the victim, claiming coercion.
*   **Prosecution:** Presented victim's testimony, medical evidence, and police investigation. Victim recanted the affidavit of desistance, claiming coercion by her mother and sister.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** Affirmed the trial court's decision finding the accused guilty of rape beyond reasonable doubt and imposing the death penalty, subject to modification of damages.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Accused found liable for rape and sentenced to death.
*   Accused ordered to pay P50,000.00 as damages to the victim.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Death Penalty:** The primary risk is the execution of the accused, although the case is automatically forwarded to the Office of the President for possible executive clemency per Article 83 of the RPC.
*   **Procedural Issues:** Appellant raised arguments regarding the trial court's failure to adequately inform him of his right to counsel and to grant him the two-day period to prepare for trial as required by Section 9 of Rule 116. Although the Supreme Court ultimately rejected these arguments based on presumptions of regularity, the potential exists for similar arguments to be raised in future cases.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Appellant challenged the credibility of the victim, citing her initial affidavit of desistance. The Court addressed the credibility of victim and addressed instances when a desistance can be retracted
    *   Affidavits, being taken ex parte, are generally considered inferior to the testimony given in open court
    *   Affidavits or recantation have been invariably regarded as exceedingly unreliable, since they can easily be secured from poor and ignorant witnesses. It would be a dangerous rule to reject the testimony taken before a court of justice simply because the witness who gave it later on changed his mind for one reason or another. Such a rule would make a solemn trial a mockery, and place the proceedings at the mercy of unscrupulous witnesses.

*   **People v. Kagui Malasugui, 63 Phil. 221:** Addressed time to prepare for trial and stated that the right must be expressly demanded

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** While the court ultimately disregarded the affidavit, the initial presence of the affidavit and the surrounding circumstances of its execution (alleged coercion) could be viewed as contentious.
*   **Waiver of Rights:** Whether the accused validly waived his right to counsel of his own choice and the two-day period to prepare for trial is a potential area of dispute. The Supreme Court based its decision on presumptions, which could be challenged with further evidence.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction and death sentence based on the victim's credible testimony and the legal framework for imposing capital punishment in cases of incestuous rape. The primary risk is the execution of the accused, pending potential executive clemency. The procedural issues raised regarding the right to counsel and preparation time were deemed insufficient for reversal but highlight the importance of strict adherence to due process in capital cases.
