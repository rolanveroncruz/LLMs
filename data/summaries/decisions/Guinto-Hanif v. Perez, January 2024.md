**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-23-082 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 19-4991-P)**

**Case:** *Rodalyn Guinto-Hanif vs. Christopher T. Perez, Sheriff IV*

**Court:** En Banc, Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Date:** January 30, 2024

**Nature of Document:** Decision in an administrative proceeding against a Sheriff.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Charges:** Grave Abuse of Authority and Gross Insubordination.
*   **Factual Background:**
    *   Dispute over control of M. Waseem International Trading Corporation stemming from alleged forcible entry by Complainant Rodalyn Guinto-Hanif into a leased property of the company.
    *   MTCC ruled against Rodalyn in a Forcible Entry case (Civil Case No. 7733).
    *   Sheriff Perez implemented the Writ of Execution, leading to the administrative complaint.
    *   Complainant alleges Sheriff Perez punched her during the execution, causing injury.
    *   Sheriff Perez failed to submit comments to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) despite multiple directives.
*   **Grave Abuse of Authority:** The Court found Sheriff Perez guilty of Grave Abuse of Authority, defining it as a public officer who wrongfully inflicts bodily harm under color of their office. The court relied on the complainant's medical certificate and pictures, noting the sheriff's failure to refute them.
*   **Gross Insubordination:** The Court found Sheriff Perez guilty of Gross Insubordination because of his repeated failure to comply with OCA directives to submit his comment on the administrative complaint. This was considered willful disrespect and a waiver of his right to defend himself.
*   **Prior Offenses:** The Court considered the fact that Sheriff Perez had been administratively sanctioned multiple times previously for neglect of duty, violating the Franking Privilege Law, and conduct unbecoming a court employee (A.M. No. P-08-2430, A.M. No. P-10-2849, A.M. No. P-10-2780, A.M. No. P-17-3759).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Sheriff Perez:** Held administratively liable for Grave Abuse of Authority and Gross Insubordination.

**Penalties:**

*   **Dismissal from Service:** For Grave Abuse of Authority, with forfeiture of all benefits (except accrued leave credits) and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office.
*   **Fine:** PHP 110,000.00 for Gross Insubordination, payable within three months. If unpaid, to be deducted from accrued leave credits.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **No Ambiguity:**  The decision is clear and unambiguous.
*   **Risk of non-payment:** There is a risk of non-payment of the fine, which the Court addressed by specifying deduction from leave credits.
*   **Argument for a less serious penalty:** Sheriff Perez's counsel (if any) could have argued that the physical contact was unintentional or justifiable within the context of implementing the writ, although his failure to respond prevented this.
*   **Appeal:** Though unlikely given the circumstances, Sheriff Perez could theoretically attempt to appeal the decision, but the factual findings and his lack of response make it a difficult task.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   There are no contentious clauses in the document. The decision is a straightforward application of the law and jurisprudence to the established facts.
