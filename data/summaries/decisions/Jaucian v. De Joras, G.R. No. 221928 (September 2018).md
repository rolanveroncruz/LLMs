## Legal Document Summary: Jaucian v. De Joras, G.R. No. 221928 (2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a CA decision reversing an RTC decision in consolidated cases for Recovery of Possession and Damages, and Reconveyance and Quieting of Title with Damages.

**Subject:** Parcels of land in Minalabac, Camarines Sur covered by OCT No. 13019 in the name of Alex A. Jaucian, issued pursuant to Free Patent No. 051722-95-3973.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Central Issue:** Validity of Jaucian's Free Patent and entitlement to possession.
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirms CA decision; Jaucian's Free Patent is **invalidated** due to fraud and misrepresentation in obtaining it. He is not entitled to possession or damages. However, the Court stops short of awarding the title to De Joras, stating that De Joras may also independently apply for a free patent.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   Jaucian failed to meet requirements for a free patent under Commonwealth Act No. 141 (Public Land Act), as amended by Republic Act No. 6940, and Republic Act No. 782, specifically the requirement of 30 years of continuous occupation and cultivation.
    *   Jaucian also concealed that De Joras were already in possession, undermining the registration.
    *   SC distinguishes between an action for *reversion* (where State ownership is admitted) and an action for *declaration of nullity of free patent*. De Joras' action is for the latter, based on allegations of pre-existing ownership and Jaucian's fraud, as supported by *Heirs of Kionisala v. Heirs of Dacut*.
    * The land may not be awarded in this case to De Joras, because the Public Land Act applies only to lands of the public domain, citing *Heirs of Spouses De Guzman v. Heirs of Bandong*.

**Obligations:**

*   Jaucian: Cease claiming ownership, refrain from disturbing De Joras' possession, pay moral damages (P100,000), exemplary damages (P100,000), attorney's fees (P50,000), and costs of litigation.

**Liabilities:**

*   Jaucian: Monetary liabilities for damages and fees. Loss of claim to the property.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Clouded Title:** Despite Jaucian's title being invalidated, De Joras does not receive a clear title. The property remains subject to potential competing claims and future application for free patent.
*  **Ambiguity of Free Patent Application:** The possibility of De Joras applying for a free patent is mentioned, implying that De Joras has to re-apply. This potentially delays the whole process.
*   **Classification of Land:** The SC notes that the land should first be classified by a positive act as alienable and disposable in accordance with the law.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Commonwealth Act No. 141 (Public Land Act), Sec. 44:** Requirements for Free Patent.
*   **Republic Act No. 6940:** Amends CA 141, extending Free Patent application period.
*   **Republic Act No. 782:** Grants Free Patents to Occupants of Public Agricultural Land.
*   **Heirs of Kionisala v. Heirs of Dacut, 428 Phil. 249 (2002):** Differentiates actions for reversion and nullity of free patent.
*   **Heirs of Spouses De Guzman v. Heirs of Bandong, G.R. No. 215454, 9 August 2017:** Free patent over privately owned land is invalid.
*   **Taar v. Lawan, G.R. No. 190922, 11 October 2017.** Summarization of Free Patent requirements.
* **Republic v. Spouses Lasmarias, G.R. No. 206168, 26 April 2017, 825 SCRA 43, 54.** Supporting details for Free Patent Application.

**Conclusion:** The SC primarily focused on the procedural error/ fraud by Jaucian in obtaining the title, without resolving the underlying issues of the true and rightful owner of the land. The case leaves De Joras in a better position but requires further action to secure a valid title.
