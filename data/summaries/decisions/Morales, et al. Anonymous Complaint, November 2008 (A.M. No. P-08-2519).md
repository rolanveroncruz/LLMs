## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-08-2519 & P-08-2520 (592 Phil. 102)

This Supreme Court Resolution addresses administrative complaints against several employees of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Manila, specifically: Atty. Miguel Morales (Branch 17 Clerk of Court), Isabel Siwa (Branch 16 Stenographer), Atty. Henry P. Favorito (OCC Clerk of Court VI), William Calda (OCC Administrative Officer III), and Amie Grace Arreola (Branch 4 Clerk of Court).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Atty. Miguel Morales:** The anonymous complaints allege misconduct for using office resources for personal cases and leaving early. Evidence of private pleadings was found on his personal computer during a spot investigation. However, the Court dismissed the charges against him due to the inadmissibility of the evidence obtained from his personal computer, citing **Section 2 and 3(2), Article III of the 1987 Constitution (right against unreasonable search and seizure and the exclusionary rule)** and **Zulueta v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 107383)**. The Court found that the "consent" to the search was not unequivocally given, as Morales immediately protested the investigation.
*   **Isabel Siwa:** Found guilty of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service for engaging in lending and rediscounting business on court premises, violating the prohibition against private business by judiciary employees (**Benavidez v. Vega, A.M. No. P-01-1530; Biyaheros Mart Livelihood Association, Inc. v. Cabusao, Jr., A.M. No. P-93-811**). Her claim of being unaware of any rule prohibiting her from engaging in rediscounting checks was rejected, and the court noted that she ignored verbal and written instruction to stop her actions, with the court finding there was a failure to submit complete transcriptions. Fined P30,000 to be deducted from her retirement benefits.
*   **Atty. Henry P. Favorito:** Reprimanded for failure to supervise Siwa's activities despite her transactions occurring in court corridors (though not directly admitted by Siwa), even if transactions were outside office hours. The court also noted Favorito failed to prevent Siwa's activities in the MeTC-OCC, and dismissed the extortion charges for lack of merit.
*   **William Calda & Amie Grace Arreola:** Charges dismissed for lack of substantial evidence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Judiciary employees are prohibited from engaging in private business and must devote full time to government service.
*   Clerks of Court have a duty to supervise activities within their jurisdiction and prevent improper conduct on court premises.
* Employees have a duty to complete all job related tasks in a timely manner.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Issues:** The case highlights the importance of obtaining valid consent before conducting searches, even in administrative investigations. Illegal searches render evidence inadmissible, potentially hindering disciplinary actions.
*   **Supervisory Liability:** Clerks of Court may be held liable for neglect of duty if they fail to adequately supervise employees and prevent improper conduct within their area of responsibility.
*   **Moonlighting:** Judiciary employees engaging in private business risk disciplinary action, regardless of whether the business itself is legal.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "consent" to a search remains a critical issue.  The subjective intention of the individual consenting is a key factor.
*   The definition of what constitutes court "premises" is somewhat ambiguous, particularly concerning corridors and common areas. The decision hinges on these areas still being under the Clerk of Court's supervision.

**Further Investigation Required:**

*   The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) is directed to conduct an audit investigation into Siwa's uncompleted stenographic transcriptions, potentially leading to additional charges.
*   The status of the complaints filed by Atty. Morales, Siwa, and Favorito against DCA Dela Cruz regarding the spot investigation needs clarification.
