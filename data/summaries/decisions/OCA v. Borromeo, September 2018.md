**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-18-3841**

**Subject:** Administrative matter against Dahlia E. Borromeo, Clerk of Court II, MTCC, Bi√±an, Laguna, for financial irregularities.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Findings of Shortages:** Financial audits revealed significant shortages in the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF), Clerk of Court General Fund, and Fiduciary Fund, totaling approximately P3,472,906.29.
*   **Non-Remittance of Collections:** Borromeo failed to remit JDF and General Fund collections for extended periods (1-2 years), violating Administrative Circular No. 3-2000 and COA/DOF Joint Circular 1-81.
*   **Improper Handling of Fiduciary Funds:** Failure to deposit fiduciary fund collections in LBP as per Administrative Circular No. 50-95, with irregular transactions noted.
*   **Failure to Maintain Records:** Disarray in record-keeping and accounting controls, missing official receipts.
*   **Non-Compliance with Directives:** Failure to comply with Court directives to explain the shortages, restitute the missing funds, produce records, and submit required reports.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Allowing a non-employee to perform court employee functions.

**Obligations:**

*   As Clerk of Court, Borromeo had a fiduciary duty to safeguard and properly manage court funds.
*   Strict compliance with Supreme Court circulars regarding the handling of judiciary funds, including timely deposits and reporting.
*   Obligation to explain and rectify the financial discrepancies.
*   Duty to maintain accurate and organized records.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Found guilty of gross dishonesty, grave misconduct, and gross neglect of duty. Dismissal from service with forfeiture of retirement benefits (excluding accrued leave credits) and perpetual disqualification from government service. Cites *Office of the Court Administrator v. Dequito*, A.M. No. P-15-3386, November 15, 2016, 809 SCRA 1, 11-12 regarding what constitutes gross neglect. Also relies on Section 52 of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, regarding the penalties for grave offenses.
*   **Financial Liability:** Ordered to restitute the full amount of the shortages. Monetary value of accrued leave credits and withheld salaries to be applied first.
*   **Potential Criminal Liability:** OCA directed to initiate appropriate criminal charges, presumably for malversation of public funds (Article 217, Revised Penal Code).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Prosecution:** Borromeo faces the risk of criminal charges for malversation, potentially leading to imprisonment.
*   **Asset Seizure:** Further legal action to recover the outstanding shortages could lead to the seizure of Borromeo's assets.
*   **Reputational Damage:** The dismissal and potential criminal charges will severely damage Borromeo's reputation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Administrative Circular No. 3-2000:** Regulations on remitting JDF collections.
*   **COA/DOF Joint Circular 1-81:** Regulations on remitting General Fund collections.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 50-95:** Guidelines for depositing Fiduciary Fund collections.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 32-93:** Collection of legal fees and submission of monthly collection reports.
*   **Article 217, Revised Penal Code:** Defines malversation of public funds.
*   *In Re: Report on the Financial Audit Conducted at the Municipal Trial Court, Baliuag, Bulacan*, A.M. No. P-15-3298 February 4, 2015, 749 SCRA 495, 501, emphasizes the critical role of clerks of court in handling judiciary funds.
*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Leal*, A.M. No. P-12-3047, October 1, 2013, 706 SCRA 487, 498, discussed the penalties for dishonesty, grave misconduct, and gross neglect of duty.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document notes the "unavailability of vital documents" for certain periods, hindering a complete audit. This could raise questions about the accuracy of the overall shortage calculation, although the Court clearly held that the record was sufficient to prove grave misconduct.

**Overall Assessment:**

This is a strong case against Borromeo, supported by audit findings and her failure to comply with court directives. The evidence of financial mismanagement and dishonesty is substantial. The risks of criminal prosecution and further financial recovery actions are significant.
