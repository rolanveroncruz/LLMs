**Case Summary: *Spouses Alwyn Ong Lim and Evelyn Lukang Lim vs. Legazpi Hope Christian School, et al.*, 601 Phil. 707 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the NLRC's ruling that Petitioners were not illegally dismissed.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Status of Employment:** The central issue is whether the Petitioner-Spouses were permanent employees or part-time teachers of Legazpi Hope Christian School. The Supreme Court ultimately sided with the Court of Appeals and NLRC that the Petitioners were part-time teachers and therefore did not acquire permanent status.
*   **Part-Time vs. Full-Time:** The Court relied heavily on Section 45 of the Manual of Regulations for Private Schools to define the difference between part-time and full-time faculty. Crucially, it found that the Petitioners did not meet the requirement of "total working day of not more than eight hours devoted to the school." The evidence showed only 2-4 hour workdays on the school.
*   **Probationary Period:** The Court recognized that New Teachers in Legazpi Hope Christian School were on probation for three (3) years. A letter of re-application was required for each school year.
*   **Termination:** The Court held that the school's decision not to renew the Petitioners' contracts after a school year did not constitute illegal dismissal, as they were part-time and their contracts were considered to be for one school year at a time.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **School's Obligation to Full-time Permanent Faculty:** Full-time faculty is to be employed for three consecutive satisfactory years before consideration of permanent status.
*   **School Liability:** The Labor Arbiter determined that the school was liable for back wages, 13th month pay, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. That decision was overturned and the Supreme Court sided with the Court of Appeals and NLRC that the employees were not illegally dismissed, and therefore, were not entitled to any financial compensation.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Written Contracts:** The absence of written employment contracts for the petitioners presented challenges. The Court referred to the “TEACHERS’ GUIDELINES” of the school to understand the terms and conditions of employment. Reliance on guidelines instead of formal contracts creates ambiguity.
*   **Definition of "Satisfactory Service" during Probation:** The case mentions the requirement of "satisfactory service" during the probationary period (as required by *University of Sto. Tomas v. NLRC*). However, there's no evidence that the employees were formally informed of reasonable standards under which they would be evaluated.
*   **Part-time vs Full time Status:** The petitioners argued that they were full time employees due to their workload. The Court considered this to be a non-issue as the employees' written testimony was that they worked less than the minimum required number of hours to be considered a full-time employee.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **University of Sto. Tomas v. NLRC, G.R. No. 85519, February 15, 1990, 182 SCRA 371:** Establishes the requisites for acquiring permanent status as a private school teacher: full-time status, three years of service, and satisfactory performance.
*   **La Consolacion College v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 127241, September 28, 2001, 366 SCRA 226, 230:** Cites the rule that "full-time teachers who have satisfactorily completed their probationary period shall be considered regular or permanent."
*   **Saint Mary's University v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 157788, March 8, 2005, 453 SCRA 61, 68.** This case established that when "respondents did not give any teaching assignment to the petitioners after the school year 2001-2002 did not amount to an actionable violation of petitioners' right. It did not amount to illegal dismissal."
*   **Manual of Regulations for Private Schools (Section 45, Section 92, Section 93):** Defines full-time vs. part-time faculty and sets the rules governing probationary periods and the attainment of regular/permanent status.

**Legal Advice Points:**

*   **Written Contracts are Crucial:**  Emphasize the importance of clear, written employment contracts defining the terms of employment, particularly regarding probationary periods, performance evaluation standards, and the basis for contract renewal or termination.
*   **Clearly Define Full-Time Status:**  Ensure that the school's definition of "full-time" matches the actual working conditions and expectations of the teaching staff. Hours of work, teaching load, and other responsibilities must be clearly documented.
*   **Due Process in Termination:** Even for probationary or part-time employees, ensure that there is adequate documentation and reasonable grounds for non-renewal or termination to minimize the risk of labor disputes.
*   **Compliance with Manual of Regulations for Private Schools:** Ensure adherence to all requirements outlined in the Manual, especially concerning the probationary period and the evaluation of performance.
