**Case Summary: *Office of the Court Administrator vs. Irene P. Fueconcillo*** (A.M. No. P-06-2208)

**Nature:** Administrative matter concerning irregularities in the handling of court funds by Irene P. Fueconcillo, former Officer-in-Charge and Interpreter I of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Science City of Muñoz, Nueva Ecija.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Audit Findings:** An audit by the OCA revealed discrepancies in Fueconcillo's handling of the Clerk of Court General Fund, Judiciary Development Fund (JDF), Mediation Fund, Fiduciary Fund, and Sheriff's Fee.  Specific shortages totaled P84,681.99. Failure to submit Monthly Report of Collections starting March 2002.

*   **Violations:** Fueconcillo violated Supreme Court Circulars No. 50-95, No. 13-92, and No. 5-93, relating to the timely deposit of court funds (including fiduciary funds and JDF) and the submission of accurate monthly reports. Delayed deposit of Mediation Fund.

*   **Unauthorized Withdrawal:** Fueconcillo admitted to an unauthorized withdrawal of P20,000.00 from the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) on two separate occasions using the same withdrawal order related to Criminal Case No. 6656 (People v. Ruben Briones, et al.).  She used pre-signed withdrawal slips for this purpose.

*   **Admission of Guilt:** Fueconcillo admitted to using the funds for personal and family expenses due to financial difficulties. She restituted P84,681.99 after the audit.

*   **Judge Eleanor TF. Marbas-Vizcarra:**  While no administrative penalty was imposed, Judge Vizcarra was admonished for lax supervision, particularly the practice of pre-signing and leaving undated withdrawal slips in Fueconcillo's possession, which enabled the unauthorized withdrawal.

**Obligations:**

*   **Fueconcillo:** Obligated to comply with SC Circulars regarding fund handling, deposit funds promptly, and submit accurate reports. As custodian of the funds, she was responsible for loss, shortage, or impairment of funds and property of the court. The Court finds that her conduct breached her duty of fidelity.

*   **Judge Vizcarra:** Obligated to supervise court personnel responsible for fund handling, particularly those managing the Fiduciary Fund, JDF, and Sheriff's Trust Fund.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Fueconcillo:** Found GUILTY of GROSS MISCONDUCT and GROSS NEGLIGENCE.  Initially subject to dismissal for grave offenses, but mitigating circumstances led to a penalty of SUSPENSION for one (1) year without pay.

*   **Judge Vizcarra:** No direct monetary liability, but received an admonishment.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Systemic Risk:** The case highlights the risk associated with lax oversight of court funds and personnel handling those funds. Undated withdrawal slips and lack of verification are significant vulnerabilities.
*   **Jurisprudence:** *Report on Anomalies of JDF Collections in MTCC, Angeles City v. Calaguas, 326 Phil. 703, 708 (1996)* establishing that belated restitution doesn't exempt an accountable officer from liability.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   SC Circular No. 50-95 (Collection and deposit of court fiduciary funds)
*   SC Circular No. 13-92 (Guidelines for administration of court funds)
*   SC Circular No. 5-93 (JDF deposit guidelines)
*   Section 52, Rule IV of the Civil Service Rules (Grave Offenses)
    Several case laws are referenced to determine the appropriate penalty, particularly regarding mitigating circumstances.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** N/A

**Legal Analysis:**

The Court, applying principles of public trust and accountability, found Fueconcillo's actions to be a grave breach of her fiduciary duty as a court officer. While the offense warrants dismissal per Civil Service Rules, the Court exercised its discretion to impose a lesser penalty of suspension due to mitigating factors – first offense after 20 years of service, restitution of the amount, family considerations, and remorse. The admonishment of Judge Vizcarra acknowledges the potential for abuse created by her court's procedures but stops short of penalizing her. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of strict adherence to Supreme Court circulars governing the handling of court funds and the need for diligent supervision by presiding judges.
