## Legal Document Summary - Valdez vs. GSIS (G.R. No. 146175)

**Nature:** Special Civil Action for Certiorari (Rule 65) assailing the CA decision upholding the CSC's opinion and resolution denying the inclusion of certain periods of service in the computation of the petitioner's retirement benefits.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Simeon M. Valdez
*   **Respondent:** Government Service Insurance System (GSIS)

**Key Issue:** Whether services rendered by the petitioner in Manila Economic Cultural Office (MECO), Mariano Memorial State University (MMSU), Philippine Veterans Investment Development Company (PHIVIDEC), and as OIC Vice-Governor of Ilocos Norte should be credited in the computation of his retirement benefits.

**CSC Opinion (January 14, 1999) and Resolution (No. 991940):**

*   Denied accreditation of petitioner's services in MECO, PHIVIDEC, and MMSU.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **MECO:** Not part of the Civil Service because it's a subsidiary corporation created under the Corporation Code, and services rendered therein shall not be considered part and parcel of government service. Referencing Section 2 (1), Article IX of the 1987 Constitution which limits the civil service to government-owned or controlled corporations with *original charters*.
    *   **MMSU, PHIVIDEC, OIC Vice-Governor:** Concurrent positions; insufficient basis to compute full-time equivalents, lack of "full-time services with compensation" required by Section 10(b), RA 8291 (Government Service Insurance System Act of 1997). No leave credits earned. Cites *Valdez v. Commission on Audit: GR 87277, 25 May 1989* on double compensation.
    *   **Reliance on Section 2(l) of RA 8291:** Compensation must be the basic pay or salary received.

**Court of Appeals Decision:**

*   Affirmed the CSC Opinion and Resolution.
*   Cited *Philippine National Company-Energy Development Corporation v. Leogardo, 175 SCRA 26, 30 (1989)*: government corporations created by special charter are subject to the Civil Service Law while those incorporated under the General Corporation Law are not within its coverage.

**Petitioner's Arguments:**

*   GSIS erred in referring his claim to CSC.
*   Claim had not prescribed (this was rejected as a false claim).
*   Services in MECO, MMSU, PHIVIDEC, and as OIC Vice-Governor should be credited.
*   Retirement benefits should be computed at his highest salary rate (MECO).

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Petition Dismissed; CA decision affirmed.**
*   **Jurisdiction Issue:** Petitioner estopped from raising jurisdiction issue, as he initially sought CSC opinion.
*   **CSC and GSIS Coordination:** Section 10 of RA 8291 authorizes GSIS and CSC to coordinate on service computation.
*   **Services in MECO, MMSU, PHIVIDEC, OIC Vice-Governor:**
    *   MECO is not part of civil service since it's incorporated under the Corporation Code (citing Constitution and *Lumanta, et al. vs. National Labor Relations Commission and Food Terminal, Inc. (170 SCRA 79)* on jurisdiction determined at time of filing).  MECO salary was beyond Salary Standardization Law (RA No. 6758).  Raises doubts about MECO employment being embraced by the civil service.
    *   MMSU, PHIVIDEC, OIC Vice-Governor were part-time and not fully compensated as defined by RA 8291. GSIS has authority to exclude part-time services if uncompensated, based on Section 2(i) of RA 8291.
*   **Improper Remedy:** Petition for certiorari is inappropriate since the arguments raised are questions of law, proper for a petition for review under Rule 45. Certiorari is limited to errors of jurisdiction, not errors of judgment.

**Key Provisions/Statutory References:**

*   **1987 Constitution:** Article IX, Section 2 (Civil Service Coverage); Article IX B, Section 5 (Standardization of Compensation)
*   **RA 8291 (Government Service Insurance System Act of 1997):** Sections 2(i) (Definition of Compensation), 10(a) (Computation of Service), 10(b) (Full-time service requirement)
*   **RA 6758 (Salary Standardization Law)**
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 65 (Certiorari), Rule 45 (Appeal by Certiorari)

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Estoppel:** Petitioner estopped from challenging CSC's jurisdiction due to his initial reliance on the CSC's opinion.
*   **Inappropriate Remedy:** Seeking certiorari instead of appeal proves fatal to the case.
*   **Salary Discrepancy:** High MECO salary raises questions of compliance with the Salary Standardization Law.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Application of the constitutional definition of the Civil Service (government corporations with "original charters") to MECO.
*   Interpretation of "full-time service with compensation" under RA 8291. The proviso gives GSIS discretion to include part-time services, but GSIS denied such credit for lack of sufficient basis for computation or compensation as defined in Sec 2(i).

**Case Law:**

*   *Philippine National Company-Energy Development Corporation v. Leogardo, 175 SCRA 26, 30 (1989)*
*   *Lumanta, et al. vs. National Labor Relations Commission and Food Terminal, Inc. (170 SCRA 79)*
*   *Valdez v. Commission on Audit: GR 87277, 25 May 1989*

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   Focus on the correct mode of appeal.
*   If similar cases arise, assess the creation of the government entity involved to determine if it has an "original charter."
*   Address compensation issues and ensure compliance with the Salary Standardization Law.
*   Clarify the definition of "full-time service with compensation" and the GSIS's discretion in including part-time service under RA 8291.
