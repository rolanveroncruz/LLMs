## Legal Document Summary: *Magaling v. Ong*, G.R. No. 173333 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a collection of sum of money case.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Lucia Magaling, Paraluman R. Magaling, Marcelina Magaling-Tablada, and Benito R. Magaling (Heirs of Reynaldo Magaling, deceased).
*   **Respondent:** Peter Ong.

**Background:** Peter Ong (Respondent) sued Spouses Reynaldo and Lucia Magaling (Spouses Magaling) and Termo Loans Credit Corporation (Termo Loans) for collection of a debt. Ong claimed Spouses Magaling, as controlling stockholders, used Termo Loans as an alter ego to evade payment. The RTC initially found only Termo Loans liable, then later dismissed the claim against the Spouses Magaling. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed, holding Spouses Magaling jointly and severally liable due to Reynaldo Magaling's gross negligence in managing Termo Loans, and reinstated a writ of preliminary attachment.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Debt Origin:** Loan extended by Ong to Termo Loans based on assurances from Reynaldo Magaling.
*   **Promissory Note & Checks:** Termo Loans, through its president Reynaldo Magaling, issued a promissory note and postdated checks that were dishonored.
*   **Corporate Liability vs. Personal Liability:** The central issue is whether Reynaldo Magaling, as President, can be held personally liable for Termo Loans' corporate debt.
*   **Preliminary Attachment:** A writ of preliminary attachment was issued against the Spouses Magaling's properties but later discharged by the RTC; CA reinstated it.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Joint and Several Liability:** The CA imposed joint and several liability on the Spouses Magaling, meaning Ong can recover the full amount from either Termo Loans or the Spouses Magaling. This poses a significant financial risk to the Spouses Magaling.
*   **Gross Negligence:** The CA pierced the corporate veil based on Reynaldo Magaling's gross negligence in directing Termo Loans' affairs. This is based on his own testimony demonstrating a lack of knowledge and control over the company's finances and operations.
*   **Attachment:** Reinstatement of the writ of preliminary attachment means the Spouses Magaling's properties remain attached and can be sold to satisfy the judgment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code of the Philippines (Sec. 31, 65, Art. 144):** Defines the separate legal personality of corporations and the exceptions where directors/officers can be held personally liable.
*   **Rule 57 of the Rules of Court:** Governs preliminary attachment, its grounds, and procedures for discharge.
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** The court applied the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil to hold the Spouses Magaling liable, citing established jurisprudence that allows such action when directors act in bad faith or with gross negligence. *See, e.g., McLeod v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 146667, 23 January 2007*

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Allegations of Fraud:** While the initial complaint alleged fraud, the CA's decision rests primarily on gross negligence, not fraud. This shift in focus raises a question of whether the initial grounds for the preliminary attachment were properly established.
*   **Raising Issue on Appeal:** Petitioners argued that the CA improperly considered the issue of Reynaldo Magaling's gross negligence because it was raised for the first time on appeal. However, the Court found that Reynaldo Magaling's gross negligence was established during cross-examination.
*   **RTC Order Dissolving Attachment:** The procedural validity of the RTC's order dissolving the attachment is questionable because it was issued without conducting a hearing.

**Potential Arguments/Next Steps:**

*   **Appeal to Supreme Court:** Further appeal to the Supreme Court is possible based on errors of law, such as the CA's application of the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil and the assessment of gross negligence. Argue that even if Reynaldo was negligent, his actions did not directly benefit him, and that the CA should not be able to make a solidary liability without solid proof.
*   **Challenge the Attachment:** Despite the CA's reinstatement, the Spouses Magaling could still challenge the attachment by posting a counter-bond or by arguing that the underlying grounds for the attachment are no longer valid given the focus on negligence rather than fraud.
