## Legal Document Summary: Racelis v. Spouses Javier (G.R. No. 189609)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding the application of Article 1658 of the Civil Code (suspension of rent) and the characterization/disposition of earnest money in a failed contract to sell.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** Racelis (administrator of the property) leased a property to Spouses Javier with a month-to-month arrangement. Intention to sell the property was present.
*   **Initial Payment/Earnest Money:** Spouses Javier paid P78,000, described as "initial payment or goodwill money" but intended as earnest money for a potential sale of the property for P3,500,000.
*   **Failed Sale:** Spouses Javier could not secure financing and purchased a different property.
*   **Termination of Lease & Ejectment:** Racelis terminated the lease and demanded Spouses Javier vacate. They refused, ceasing rent payments. Electrical service was disconnected.
*   **Dispute:** Racelis filed an ejectment suit. Spouses Javier claimed the P78,000 was advance rent and should offset unpaid rentals.
*   **Lower Courts:** MTC dismissed the complaint and ordered return of the P78,000. RTC reversed, ordering the Spouses Javier to pay accrued rent and declared they could recover the P78,000 in a separate proceeding. CA declared the Spouses Javier were justified in withholding rental payments due to the disconnection of electrical service over the property and Racelis was ordered to reimburse the amount of P24,000 to the Spouses Javier.

**Issues:**

1.  Can the Spouses Javier invoke Article 1658 to suspend rent payments due to the disconnection of electrical service?
2.  Can the P78,000 initial payment offset the Spouses Javier's accrued rent?

**Holding:**

1.  No. Article 1658 does not apply because the lease had already expired when the electrical service was disconnected. The Spouses Javier unlawfully withheld possession after the termination notice. Moreover, even if Article 1658 applied, it does not exonerate the lessee from the obligation to pay rent.
2.  No. The P78,000 was not advance rent but earnest money in a contract *to sell*. Since the sale did not materialize due to the buyer's (Spouses Javier's) fault, the earnest money is forfeited in favor of the seller (Racelis).

**Final Disposition:** Petition granted. CA decision reversed and set aside. The Spouses Javier were ordered to pay Racelis P54,000 (accrued rentals of P84,000, less advance deposit of P30,000), with 6% interest p.a. from finality.

**Key Legal Principles & Citations:**

*   **Article 1658, Civil Code:** Allows lessee to suspend rent payment if lessor fails to make necessary repairs or maintain peaceful enjoyment of the property. Limited to disturbances of **legal possession**.
    *   *Goldstein v. Roces*, 34 Phil. 562 (1916): Defines "peaceful enjoyment" as undisturbed legal possession, not mere physical disturbances.
    *   *Chua Tee Dee v. Court of Appeals*, 473 Phil. 446 (2004): Reiterates *Goldstein* principle.
*   **Contract to Sell vs. Contract of Sale:** Distinguishes between the two based on the transfer of ownership and the suspensive condition of full payment in a contract to sell. Non-payment in a contract to sell is not a breach, but prevents the obligation to convey title from arising.
    *   *Ayala Life Assurance, Inc. v. Ray Burton Development Corp.*, 515 Phil. 431, 438 (2006)
    *   *Chua v. Court of Appeals*, 449 Phil. 25, 42 (2003)
*   **Earnest Money (Article 1482, Civil Code):** Generally proof of perfection of the contract of sale but can also be given in a contract to sell. In a contract to sell, it serves as consideration for the seller's opportunity cost of holding the property and is forfeited if the sale fails without the seller's fault.
    *   *Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals*, 330 Phil. 1048 (1996): Earnest money as consideration for reserving property for the buyer.
*   **Opportunity Cost:**  The value of the foregone alternative.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Letter Offering Reimbursement:** Racelis' letter offering to reimburse the P78,000 was conditioned upon selling the property to another buyer. The court held that this was not an express waiver of her right to retain the earnest money, as it was not an unconditional offer.
*   **Mitigation of Damages:** The court could have explored if Racelis took steps to mitigate her damages after the Spouses Javier clearly manifested their intention not to buy the property. Did she actively seek other buyers during the period she was leasing to the Spouses Javier?

This document is a reminder of the importance of clearly documenting the intent of parties when drafting contracts. Specifically, when an initial payment is made, its character as either earnest money or advance rental should be clearly specified in the contract. This will avoid any ambiguity or dispute in the future.
