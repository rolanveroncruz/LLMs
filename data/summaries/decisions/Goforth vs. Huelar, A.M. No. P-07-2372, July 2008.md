## Summary of *Goforth v. Huelar, Jr.*, A.M. No. P-07-2372

**Case:** *Marichu T. Goforth v. Tomas C. Huelar, Jr.*, A.M. No. P-07-2372, July 23, 2008 (581 Phil. 309).

**Facts:** Marichu Goforth filed a complaint against Tomas C. Huelar, Jr., Officer-in-Charge of the RTC, Branch 11, San Jose, Antique, for negligence in failing to promptly transmit court records to the Court of Appeals (CA) following the Solicitor General's notice of appeal in a land reconstitution case. The RTC ordered transmittal on February 23, 1999, but the records were only forwarded on September 23, 2002. Huelar initially failed to respond to the OCA's inquiries and later blamed his subordinates, claiming he instructed them to transmit the records once he learned of the delay. He retired in February 2005.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) found Huelar GUILTY of Gross Negligence and Indifference to Court Directives. He was fined P15,000, to be deducted from his retirement benefits.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 41, Section 10(d) of the Rules of Court:** Imposes a duty on clerks of court to transmit records to the appellate court within 30 days of the perfection of the appeal. This is the core legal basis for the finding of negligence.

*   **Duty of Competence and Efficiency:** As officer-in-charge tasked with duties of clerk of court, Huelar had obligation to perform duties with competence and efficiency.

*   **Supervisory Responsibility:** Huelar, as the officer-in-charge, could not disclaim responsibility for the actions of his subordinates. He has a duty to ensure orderly and efficient record management.

*   **Duty to Comply with Court Orders:** Failure to respond to the OCA's directives was considered disrespect and a separate ground for administrative liability (Lumapas v. Tamin, A.M. No. RTJ-99-1519, 26 June 2003, 405 SCRA 30).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Found guilty of gross negligence and indifference to court directives.
*   **Financial Liability:** Fined P15,000, to be deducted from retirement benefits.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Delegation of Duty:** Huelar's attempt to delegate responsibility to subordinates was explicitly rejected, reinforcing the non-delegable nature of certain supervisory duties.
*   **Delayed Response:** The court emphasized that delayed response to the court, as the records took over 3 years to be transmitted, showed gross negligence and that the delay was not justifiable.
*   **Mitigation due to Retirement:** While dismissal was deemed inappropriate due to Huelar's retirement, the SC still imposed a substantial fine. This underscores that retirement does not automatically shield individuals from all consequences of prior misconduct.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 41, Section 10(d) of the Rules of Court:** Crucial provision outlining the timeline for record transmittal.
*   **Oba√±ana, Jr. v. Ricafort, A.M. No. MTJ-04-1545, 27 May 2004, 429 SCRA 223:** Cited to support the point that position required competence and efficiency.
*   **Lumapas v. Tamin, A.M. No. RTJ-99-1519, 26 June 2003, 405 SCRA 30:** Cited to show that failure to respond showed disrespect to the Court, an act only too deserving of reproof.
*   **Uniform Rules in Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Defines gross negligence as a grave offense, potentially punishable by dismissal, suspension or fine.

**Ambiguities/Points of Contention (if any):**

*   The resolution is fairly clear and straightforward. No obvious ambiguities exist.
