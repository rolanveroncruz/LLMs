**Legal Document Summary: Asiavest Limited v. Court of Appeals and Antonio Heras (G.R. No. 128803)**

**Nature:** Case regarding the enforceability in the Philippines of a Hong Kong court judgment against Antonio Heras. Asiavest, the plaintiff, seeks to recover sums awarded in Hong Kong based on Heras's personal guarantee.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Foreign Judgment Presumption:** The Hong Kong judgment is presumed valid under Section 50, Rule 39 (now Section 48 of Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure) of the Rules of Court as presumptive evidence of a right. The burden to repel it lies with Heras, based on want of jurisdiction, want of notice, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law/fact. *Northwest Orient Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 241 SCRA 192, 199 [1995]*
*   **Jurisdiction Over the Person:**  The central issue is whether the Hong Kong court properly acquired jurisdiction over Heras's person.
*   **Service of Summons:** The case hinges on the validity of the summons served on Heras outside Hong Kong, specifically in the Philippines.
*   **Lex Fori:** Procedural matters, including service of process, are governed by the *lex fori* (Hong Kong law).
*   **Heras's Residence:** Determination of Heras's residence is vital.  The stipulated fact that "the residence of defendant, Antonio Heras, is New Manila, Quezon City" refers to his residence at the time jurisdiction over his person was being sought by the Hong Kong court.
*   **Type of Action:** The action against Heras in Hong Kong is *in personam* (based on personal guarantee).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   If the Hong Kong judgment is deemed enforceable, Heras is obligated to pay the sums awarded, including US$1,810,265.40, interest, and attorney's fees.
*   Asiavest had the burden to prove jurisdiction of the foreign court.
*   Heras had the burden to overcome the presumption of validity of the Hong Kong judgment.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Service Validity under Philippine Law:** The Court of Appeals, relying on expert testimony (Lousich), considered whether the substituted service in the Philippines complied with Philippine law. Failure to follow Philippine rules on personal service (Sec. 7, Rule 14) and substituted service (Sec. 8, Rule 14) jeopardized the validity.
*   **Expert Witness Testimony:** While expert testimony on foreign law is permissible, the testimony was vague regarding Hong Kong's specific laws on service of summons. *Willamette Iron and Steel Works v. Muzzal, 61 Phil. 471 [1935]*
*   **Processual Presumption:** Due to lack of specific Hong Kong law evidence, the court applied the "processual presumption," assuming Hong Kong law is similar to Philippine law regarding service of summons.
*   **Heras's Residency:**  Although initially maintaining the Hong Kong court lacked jurisdiction due to his non-residency, a stipulation indicated his residence was in Quezon City. This played a crucial role in determining the proper service method.
*   **Jurisdiction in Personam Requirements:** For *in personam* actions against non-residents, personal service within the foreign state is generally required to establish jurisdiction. If Heras was not a resident of Hong Kong, personal service within Hong Kong was necessary. *Boudart v. Tait, 67 Phil. 170, 174-175 1 [1939]*

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 50 (now Rule 39, Section 48):** Enforceability of foreign judgments.
*   **Rule 131, Section 3(n):** Presumption of lawful exercise of jurisdiction by courts.
*   **Rule 14, Sections 7 & 8:** Personal and substituted service of summons.
*   **Rule 14, Sections 17 & 18:** Extraterritorial service of summons.
*   ***Northwest Orient Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals***: Foreign judgment presumption.
*   ***Valmonte vs. Court of Appeals***: Distinguishes *in personam*, *in rem*, and *quasi in rem* actions for service of summons.
*   ***Brown v. Brown***: Service on non-residents and those who have abandoned their residence.
*   ***Gemperle v. Schenker***: Exception to personal service on non-residents.
*   ***Willamette Iron and Steel Works v. Muzzal***: Expert testimony as proof of foreign law.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court ultimately denied Asiavest's petition and affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the Hong Kong court lacked jurisdiction over Heras because he was not a resident of Hong Kong and was not personally served within its jurisdiction. The Hong Kong judgment was deemed unenforceable in the Philippines.
