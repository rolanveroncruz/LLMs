## Legal Document Summary: *Republic vs. Alaminos Ice Plant* (G.R. No. 189723, July 11, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's grant of Alaminos Ice Plant's application for original land registration.

**Key Issue:** Whether Alaminos Ice Plant sufficiently proved that the land subject of registration is alienable and disposable public land, and met the requirements for original registration.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA's decision and dismissed Alaminos Ice Plant's application.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Regalian Doctrine:** All lands belong to the State. Applicant has the burden to overcome the presumption of State ownership by proving the land is alienable and disposable. *See also Republic v. Medida, Republic v. Roche, Republic vs. Lualhati*
*   **Insufficient Proof of Alienability:** The CENRO certification presented by Alaminos Ice Plant was deemed *insufficient* and of *no evidentiary value* to prove the land's alienable and disposable nature.
*   **Lack of DENR Secretary Approval:** Applicant failed to present a certified true copy of the DENR Secretary's original land classification approval. This is required to prove the land's status.
*   **Improper Presentation of Evidence:** The CENRO certification was submitted for the first time on appeal, and was not formally offered or identified during trial. Courts can only base their judgements on evidence that was formally offered during trial. *See also Fideldia v. Sps. Mulato*

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Republic v. T.A.N. Properties (578 Phil. 441, 2008):** Established the requirement that a mere CENRO/PENRO certification of alienability is insufficient. Applicant must prove DENR Secretary approval.
*   **Republic v. Vega (654 Phil. 511, 2011):** Reaffirmed the general rule requiring both CENRO/PENRO certification AND a certified true copy of the DENR Secretary's original classification.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Inadequate Due Diligence:** The Respondent's reliance on a CENRO certification without ensuring it met the stringent requirements outlined in *Republic v. T.A.N. Properties* proved fatal.
*   **Procedural Defect:** Presenting the CENRO Certification late in the process, specifically on Appeal, raises significant concern as this was not something that was formally scrutinised by the Lower Court.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document lacks specific statutory references beyond the Property Registration Decree (PD 1529) and Commonwealth Act No. 141, and does not delve into the specific regulations governing the classification and disposition of public lands, such as specific DENR Administrative Orders beyond DAO Nos. 20 and 38.
*   The weight given to Tax Declarations as evidence of *bona fide* ownership could be contested, as the court notes they are not conclusive, but only "good indicia" of ownership in the concept of an owner.

**Conclusion:**

The case underscores the stringent requirements for proving that public land is alienable and disposable in land registration proceedings. The failure to present the required documentation, particularly a certified copy of the DENR Secretary's land classification approval, is fatal to an application for original registration. Further, the case highlights the importance of adhering to procedural rules regarding the formal offer of evidence.
