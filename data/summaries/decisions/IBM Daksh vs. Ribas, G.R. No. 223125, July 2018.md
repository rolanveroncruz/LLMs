**Case:** IBM Daksh Business Process Services Philippines, Inc. (now Concentrix Daksh Business Process Services Philippines Corporation) v. Rosallie S. Ribas, G.R. No. 223125, July 11, 2018.

**Summary:** This case involves the illegal dismissal of Rosallie S. Ribas by IBM Daksh (Concentrix). Ribas was terminated for alleged AWOL after absences related to pregnancy complications and her child's illness. The LA initially dismissed Ribas's complaint, but the NLRC reversed, finding illegal dismissal and ordering reinstatement and backwages.  Upon motion for reconsideration, the NLRC upheld the dismissal's validity but still ordered reinstatement without backwages citing equity and compassion.

Both parties filed petitions for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA).  The CA, in two separate divisions and without consolidation, issued conflicting decisions. The first decision (CA-G.R. SP No. 132743) affirmed the NLRC's finding of valid dismissal but ordered reinstatement without backwages; this decision became final and executory. The second decision (CA-G.R. SP No. 132908), subject of this Supreme Court review, reversed the NLRC, finding illegal dismissal and ordering reinstatement with backwages and, if reinstatement is not feasible, separation pay.

The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the second CA decision, holding that the CA committed a procedural error by failing to consolidate the two cases, leading to conflicting rulings. The SC upheld the *final and executory* first CA decision (CA-G.R. SP No. 132743) based on the doctrine of finality of judgments.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Dismissal for Cause (AWOL):** IBM Daksh argues dismissal was for cause (violation of company code of conduct regarding attendance).
*   **Due Process:** IBM Daksh asserts compliance with due process (issuance of show cause memo, hearing).
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Ribas claims absences were justified due to pregnancy complications and her child's illness, and that she notified her supervisor. She also argues the penalty was too harsh.
*   **CA Procedural Error:** The CA failed to consolidate related cases, resulting in conflicting decisions, a violation of Section 3(a), Rule III of the 2009 Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals.
*   **Finality of Judgment:** The SC prioritizes the final and executory CA decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 132743 based on the doctrine of finality of judgments.  *Lomondot, et al. v. Judge Balindong, et al., 763 Phil. 617, 627 (2015). Sps. Navarra v. Liongson, 784 Phil. 942, 954 (2016).*
*   **Forum Shopping:** The SC criticizes the respondent's counsel for failing to disclose the final and executory first CA decision.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employer (IBM Daksh/Concentrix):** Ultimately liable for reinstating Ribas to her former position *without backwages*, as per the final CA decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 132743. No separation pay is required.
*   **Employee (Ribas):** Obligated to accept reinstatement under the terms dictated by the final and executory CA decision.
*   **Counsel (for Ribas):** SC reminds all counsels of their responsibility to notify the court of any related pending cases and to move for consolidation thereof. Section 5, Rule 7.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ethical Issues for Counsel:** The SC hints at potential ethical issues for Ribas's counsel for non-disclosure of the previous final CA decision, potentially bordering on unethical conduct and raising concerns about forum shopping.
*   **Administrative Sanctions:** The SC warns that failure to disclose related cases could lead to administrative sanctions.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Labor Code:** Implied reference to provisions regarding just cause for termination and due process requirements.
*   **Rules of Court:** Specifically, Section 5 of Rule 7 concerning certification against forum shopping.
*   **2009 Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals:** Section 3(a), Rule III mandating consolidation of related cases.
*   **Re: Letter Complaint of Fabiana against Presiding Justices Reyes, Jr., et al., 713 Phil. 161, 174 (2013):** On consolidation of cases and ethical obligations of counsel.
*   **Lomondot, et al. v. Judge Balindong, et al., 763 Phil. 617, 627 (2015):** Doctrine of finality of judgments.
*   **Sps. Navarra v. Liongson, 784 Phil. 942, 954 (2016):** Exceptions to the rule on the immutability of final judgments.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The issue of whether Ribas's absences constituted "serious misconduct" or "gross and habitual neglect of duty" seems to be a point of contention, ultimately resolved by prioritizing the procedural issue of the conflicting CA decisions.
*   The initial NLRC decision to reinstate "for reasons of equity and compassion" despite finding a valid dismissal raises questions about the NLRC's rationale, though ultimately irrelevant due to the procedural outcome.

**Conclusion:**

The SC decision hinges on a procedural defect (failure to consolidate) rather than the merits of the illegal dismissal claim. This case serves as a strong reminder to the appellate courts for consolidating related cases and to counsels about their duty of disclosure and avoidance of forum shopping. The company is obligated to reinstate the employee, but without backwages, based on the already final decision of the Court of Appeals.
