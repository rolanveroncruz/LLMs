**Case Summary: Sierra v. Lopez, et al., Adm. Case No. 7549 (2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Disciplinary action against City Prosecutor of Manila Jhosep Y. Lopez, 1st Assistant City Prosecutor (ACP) Eufrocino Sulla, Assistant City Prosecutors Alexander Yap, Marlo Campanilla and Armando Velasco, for dereliction of duty and gross ignorance of the law.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Complainant's Allegations:** Aurelio M. Sierra alleged that the respondents mishandled his cases involving Misrepresentation through Deceit and Syndicated Large Scale Fraud in Land Titling with Conspiracy, Land Grabbing, Falsification of Public Document and Economic Sabotage by not requiring all respondents in the underlying cases to appear simultaneously for preliminary investigation and for allowing counter-affidavits to be sworn before prosecutors other than the investigating prosecutor, and for denying clarificatory questions.
*   **Rule 112, Sec. 3 of the Rules of Court:** This rule outlines the procedure for preliminary investigations.
*   **Confrontation Clause/Appearance of Parties:** Whether parties *must* appear together during preliminary investigations.
*   **Swearing of Counter-Affidavits:** Whether counter-affidavits *must* be sworn before the investigating prosecutor.
*   **Clarificatory Questioning:** Whether the denial of complainant's request for clarificatory questioning constituted an abuse of discretion.

**Supreme Court Holding/Analysis:**

*   **No Merit to Complaint:** The Supreme Court denied the complaint for lack of merit.
*   **Rule 112 Doesn't Require Confrontation:** The Court held that Rule 112 does not mandate a confrontation between the parties during preliminary investigation, as it is ordinarily conducted through affidavits. Cites *Rodis, Sr. v. Sandiganbayan*, G.R. Nos. 71404-09, October 26, 1988, 166 SCRA 618, holding that the presence of the accused is not a condition *sine qua non*.
*   **Counter-Affidavits Can Be Sworn Before Other Prosecutors:** The Court explicitly stated that counter-affidavits can be sworn before any prosecutor, government official, or notary public, citing Rule 112, Sec. 3(a) and (c).
*   **Denial of Clarificatory Questioning is Discretionary:** The decision to allow clarificatory questioning lies within the prosecutor's discretion. Cites *Webb v. De Leon*, G.R. Nos. 121245 &121297, August 23, 1995, 247 SCRA 653.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The document clarifies the obligations and discretion of investigating prosecutors during preliminary investigations.
*   The document reaffirms existing jurisprudence that clarifies there is no dereliction of duty based on the specific claims of the complainant regarding required synchronous appearances, oath taking location for counter-affidavits, and denial of clarificatory questioning.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The discretionary nature of clarificatory questioning could potentially lead to uneven application of justice if not exercised fairly.
*   While *Rodis* allows for preliminary investigation even without the accused's presence, the extent of the efforts to reach the accused, and what constitutes a reasonable opportunity to controvert the evidence, could be subject to further litigation.
*   This decision does not address fact patterns outside the specific allegations of dereliction made by Sierra; it remains possible for prosecutors to be disciplined for other actions in a preliminary investigation.
*   The vagueness in the rule regarding whether the prosecutor can interview a witness without giving the other party an opportunity to submit questions prior to the interview is also left unaddressed.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 112 of the Rules of Court, specifically Section 3.
