**Legal Document Summary: MOF Company, Inc. vs. Shin Yang Brokerage Corporation, G.R. No. 172822, December 18, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of a collection suit for unpaid freightage, documentation fee, and terminal handling charges.

**Key Issue:** Whether a consignee named in a bill of lading, but who did not sign it or explicitly consent to its terms, is bound by the freight collect provision and liable for associated charges.

**Facts:** Halla Trading Co. shipped goods to Manila naming Shin Yang as the consignee on a "Freight Collect" basis. MOF, Hanjin's (carrier) agent, sued Shin Yang for non-payment of freightage. Shin Yang denied involvement, claiming to be merely a consolidator, without endorsement of the bill of lading, and without authorizing the shipment.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's dismissal, holding that Shin Yang was not liable for the freight charges.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Bill of Lading:**  The bill of lading, per Art. 653 of the Code of Commerce and *Market Developers, Inc. (MADE) vs. Honorable Intermediate Appellate Court*, is the sole evidence of title to the cargo and may serve as the contract of affreightment in lieu of a charter party, as affirmed in *Compania Maritima vs. Insurance Company of North America*.
*   **Contract of Affreightment:** The issue is whether the consignee is bound by the terms. The court cites *Belgian Overseas Chartering and Shipping N.V. vs. Phil. First Insurance Co., Inc.* regarding the functions of a bill of lading as a receipt and a contract.
*   **Liability of Consignee:**  A consignee can be bound if there's:
    *   Agency relationship with the shipper.
    *   Unequivocal acceptance of the bill of lading (*Keng Hua Paper Products Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*).
    *   Availment of stipulation *pour autrui* by demanding delivery (*Mendoza v. Philippine Air Lines, Inc.*). Reference to Article 1311, paragraph 2, of the Civil Code regarding stipulations in favor of third parties.
*   **Burden of Proof:** MOF bore the burden of proving Shin Yang's consent or involvement (*Luxuria Homes Inc. vs. CA*). The court cites *Acabal v. Acabal* on the burden of proof residing with the asserting party. The SC found MOF failed to meet the *preponderance of evidence* standard required in civil cases (*New Testament Church of God v. Court of Appeals*; *Condes v. Court of Appeals*).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Agency Proof:** MOF failed to prove an agency relationship. This was fatal to its claim.
*   **No Explicit Acceptance:**  Shin Yang's denial of the bill of lading and lack of endorsement negated any implied acceptance, preventing it from being bound by its terms.
*   **Stipulation Pour Autrui Requirements:**  Even with a stipulation in its favor, Shin Yang did not demand performance (delivery), a requirement for availing the stipulation *pour autrui.*

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Code of Commerce, Arts. 652 & 653 (Charter Party & Bill of Lading)
*   Civil Code, Art. 1311 (Stipulation Pour Autrui)
*   *Market Developers, Inc. vs. Honorable Intermediate Appellate Court*
*   *Compania Maritima vs. Insurance Company of North America*
*   *Belgian Overseas Chartering and Shipping N.V. vs. Phil. First Insurance Co., Inc.*
*   *Keng Hua Paper Products Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*
*   *Mendoza v. Philippine Air Lines, Inc.*
*   *Luxuria Homes Inc. vs. CA*
*   *Acabal v. Acabal*
*   *New Testament Church of God v. Court of Appeals*
*   *Condes v. Court of Appeals*
*   *Sea-Land Service v. Intermediate Appellate Court*

**Conclusion:** This case highlights the importance of proving consent or other connecting factors beyond mere mention as consignee in a bill of lading. The case emphasizes the need for clear evidence of agency, acceptance, or a demand for performance to bind a consignee to a "freight collect" provision.
