Okay, here's a legal summary of the *Saludaga v. Far Eastern University* case, formatted in Markdown:

**Case Summary: *Joseph Saludaga v. Far Eastern University and Edilberto C. De Jesus***
**G.R. No. 179337, April 30, 2008**

**Facts:**
*   Joseph Saludaga, a FEU law student, was shot by a security guard (Rosete) on school premises.
*   Saludaga sued FEU and its President (De Jesus) for damages, alleging breach of contract for failure to provide a safe learning environment.
*   FEU filed a third-party complaint against Galaxy Development and Management Corporation (security agency) and its President (Imperial).
*   Galaxy and Imperial filed a Fourth-Party Complaint against AFP General Insurance.

**Issue:**
Whether FEU is liable for damages due to the shooting of a student by a security guard employed by its contracted security agency, Galaxy, within the university premises, alleging a breach of contract for failure to provide a safe learning environment. Additionally, whether FEU can recover damages from the third-party defendants.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Saludaga, finding FEU liable for damages, reversing the Court of Appeals' decision.
**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Student-School Contract:**  The court reiterated the principle in *Philippine School of Business Administration v. Court of Appeals* (205 SCRA 729) that a contract exists between a school and its students.  The school has a "built-in" obligation to provide a safe learning environment.
*   **Breach of Contract (Culpa Contractual):**  The shooting incident, perpetrated by a security guard hired by FEU, established a *prima facie* case of breach of contract.  FEU failed to provide a safe and secure environment. Cites *FGU Insurance Corporation v. G.P. Sarmiento Trucking Corporation*, 435 Phil. 333, 341 (2002).
*   **Due Diligence:**  FEU failed to prove that they exercised due diligence in selecting and supervising Galaxy's security services. The court specifically noted the lack of evidence regarding Rosete's qualifications and FEU's failure to verify Galaxy's compliance with the Security Service Agreement, including checking clearances, psychiatric evaluations, and personnel files.
*   **Force Majeure/Fortuitous Event:** FEU's defense of *force majeure* was rejected because FEU was negligent in ensuring a secure environment.  Cites *Mindex Resources Development v. Morillo*, 428 Phil. 934, 944 (2002). An act of God cannot be invoked to protect a person who has failed to take steps to forestall the possible adverse consequences of such a loss.
*   **Damages:**
    *   **Actual Damages:** Awarded for hospitalization expenses (P35,298.25) with interest (6% per annum from filing of the complaint until finality, then 12% per annum). Cites *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994, 234 SCRA 78, 95-97.
    *   **Temperate Damages:** Awarded for expenses that couldn't be proven with certainty (P20,000.00).  Art. 2224 of the Civil Code.
    *   **Moral Damages:** Awarded for physical suffering, mental anguish, etc. (P100,000.00).
    *   **Attorney's Fees:** Awarded as part of damages (P50,000.00). Art. 2208 of the Civil Code.
    *   **Exemplary Damages:**  Deleted due to lack of proof of wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent conduct.
* **Corporate Liability:** Respondent De Jesus, as FEU President, was NOT held solidarily liable with FEU because there was no evidence presented satisfying any of the exceptions to the general rule that a corporate officer cannot be held personally liable for the liabilities of the corporation. Cites *Powton Conglomerate, Inc. v. Agcolicol*, 448 Phil. 643 (2003).
*   **Vicarious Liability (Art. 2180, Civil Code):**  FEU was not held vicariously liable under Art. 2180 because Rosete was an employee of Galaxy, not FEU. Giving instructions to the security guard is not sufficient to be deemed an employer.  Cites *Mercury Drug Corporation v. Libunao*, G.R. No. 144458, July 14, 2004, 434 SCRA 404.
*   **Third-Party Liability (Galaxy):** Galaxy and Imperial were held jointly and severally liable to indemnify FEU for the damages awarded to Saludaga. This was based on Galaxy's negligence in the selection and supervision of its employees and the failure to make good on promises to cover medical expenses.

**Obligations:**

*   FEU: Provide a safe learning environment.
*   Galaxy: Provide qualified security personnel and adequately supervise them.
*   Imperial: To exercise due diligence as President in directing the affairs of the security agency

**Liabilities:**

*   FEU: Liable for damages (actual, temperate, moral, attorney's fees) for breach of contract.
*   Galaxy & Imperial: Liable to indemnify FEU for the damages awarded to Saludaga.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Security Agency:** The case highlights the risk of over-reliance on a security agency without independent verification of qualifications and competence. FEU should not have "contracted away" its inherent obligation.
*   **Solidary Liability:** It is critical for institutions to avoid situations where officers can be held personally liable. The Court specified the instances where solidary liability may occur.

**Key Case Law:**

*   *Philippine School of Business Administration v. Court of Appeals*, 205 SCRA 729 (student-school contract).
*   *Mercury Drug Corporation v. Libunao*, 434 SCRA 404 (vicarious liability and security agencies).
*   *Powton Conglomerate, Inc. v. Agcolicol*, 448 Phil. 643 (corporate liability of officers)

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code, Art. 1170 (negligence in performance of obligations).
*   Civil Code, Art. 2180 (vicarious liability).
*   Civil Code, Art. 2208 (attorney's fees).
*   Civil Code, Art. 2224 (temperate damages).
