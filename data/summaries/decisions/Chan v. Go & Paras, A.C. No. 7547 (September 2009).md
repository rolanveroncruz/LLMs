**Legal Document Summary: *Chan v. Go & Paras***

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in an administrative case (A.C. No. 7547) regarding alleged violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility, Canons of Professional Ethics, and the Rules of Court by NLRC Commissioner Romeo Go and Atty. Jose Raulito E. Paras.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Complainant (Chan) alleges:** Respondents engaged in influence peddling and attempted extortion related to a labor case (Susan Que Tiu v. Chan & companies) pending before the NLRC. Specifically, Chan claims the respondents arranged multiple meetings, claiming influence over the NLRC decision, and implicitly demanded money.

*   **Respondents' Defense:** Deny the allegations. Paras denies conspiracy with Go, denies knowledge of Tiu or the case, and claims limited presence at meetings. Go denies influence peddling, denies introducing Paras as his associate, and claims he merely assisted with conciliation without coercion.

**Court's Ruling & Rationale:**

*   The Supreme Court dismissed the complaint for lack of merit.

*   **Key Reasoning:**

    *   **Insufficient Evidence:** Chan provided no clear, convincing, or satisfactory evidence to support his claims of influence peddling, extortion, or other misconduct. The receipts are insufficient to prove the presence of the accused.
    *   **Timing & Motive:** The complaint was filed long after the alleged events and the resolution of the labor case, suggesting it was leverage for a criminal case filed *by* Paras against Chan (I.S. No. 07-71604-D) for Grave Oral Slander, Serious Slander by Deed, Grave Threats, and Alarms and Scandals.
    *   **Lack of Logical Consistency:** The Court found it illogical that the complainant would continue meeting with the respondents and pay for their meals if they were indeed extorting him.
    *   **Rule 6.02 Application:** Court agreed with Paras that the charge of violation of Rule 6.02, Canon 6 of the Code of Professional Responsibility is misplaced as he was not a government lawyer at the time material to the acts complained of.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **For Chan:** Risks of sanctions for filing a frivolous or malicious complaint if evidence suggested an intent to harass or defame.
*   **For Go & Paras:** Reputation damage, potential disbarment (had the allegations been substantiated), and possible criminal charges related to extortion/corruption if evidence was present.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility:** (Canon 1, Rule 1.01, 1.02; Canon 6, Rule 6.02; Canon 7, Canon 13) – Alleged violations formed the basis of the complaint.
*   **Canons of Professional Ethics:** (Canon 32) – Cited as allegedly violated by the respondents.
*   **Rules of Court:** (Rule 138, Sec. 27) – Outlines grounds for attorney removal or suspension.
* Aquino v. Villamar-Mangaoang, 469 Phil. 613, 618 (2004) - Burden of proof in disbarment cases.
* Urban Bank, Inc. v. Peña, 417 Phil. 70, 78 (2001). - Onus of validating allegations lies with the one alleging.
*   **Criminal Cases:** The court mentions Chan filed an Estafa case against Tiu et al.(I.S. No. 06B-02382) which was dismissed. Paras filed Grave Oral Slander, Serious Slander by Deed, Grave Threats, and Alarms and Scandals against Chan(I.S. No. 07-71604-D), which the court hints as a motive for the administrative case.
    *   Chan also filed a Grave Misconduct (OMB-C-A-07-0301-F) against the respondents in the Ombusdman.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The core issue revolves around the interpretation of the meetings between Chan and the respondents.  Chan characterized them as extortion attempts, while the respondents framed them as either innocent or initiated by Chan. The Court ultimately sided with the respondents' interpretation due to lack of corroborating evidence for Chan's allegations.
*   The subjective intent behind Go's alleged representations about influencing the NLRC decision is also contentious.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court found Chan's claims unsubstantiated and dismissed the administrative complaint. The ruling emphasizes the need for clear and convincing evidence in disciplinary proceedings against lawyers and highlights the potential for such complaints to be used as leverage in separate legal battles.
