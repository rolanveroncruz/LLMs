**Case Summary: Masbate v. Relucio, G.R. No. 235498, July 30, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision setting aside the RTC's Orders and remanding the case for determination of child custody. Original action was a petition for habeas corpus and child custody.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Custody Dispute:** Focuses on the custody of an illegitimate minor child, Queenie, born to Renalyn and Ricky James.
*   **Article 176, Family Code:** Illegitimate children are under the parental authority of the mother. The court ruled that the issue of Renalyn's fitness as a mother must be threshed out in the trial court before she can be denied custody.
*   **Article 213, Family Code (Tender-Age Presumption):** "No child under seven years of age shall be separated from the mother unless the court finds compelling reasons to order otherwise." The ruling clarifies this presumption applies regardless of whether the parents are married, contrary to the petitioner's assertion based on misinterpretation of *Pablo-Gualberto v. Gualberto V*. Compelling reasons include neglect, abandonment, unemployment, etc.
*   **Substitute Parental Authority (Article 216, Family Code):** In case of the mother's unfitness, substitute parental authority is granted in order of preference (grandparent, sibling, actual custodian). The father's status as an illegitimate father doesn't automatically disqualify him as actual custodian.
*   **Best Interests of the Child:** Paramount consideration in custody disputes, as mandated by the Child and Youth Welfare Code and A.M. No. 03-04-04-SC.
*   **A.M. No. 03-04-04-SC (Rule on Custody of Minors and Writ of Habeas Corpus):** Provides the procedural framework for custody cases. Section 15 defines temporary visitation rights and Section 18 covers orders concerning custody after trial. The CA erred in granting temporary custody to the father before trial.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Renalyn (Mother):** Burden to prove fitness as a parent. If found unfit, parental authority may be transferred. Has the right to sole custody of her illegitimate child, unless compelling reasons dictate otherwise.
*   **Ricky James (Father):** Must prove Renalyn's unfitness and his own suitability for custody, should the mother be deemed unfit. Entitled to visitation rights.
*   **RTC (Trial Court):** Obligated to conduct a full trial to determine Renalyn's fitness and the best interests of the child.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Remand for Trial:** Prolonged litigation and emotional strain on the child.
*   **Finding of Unfitness:** Renalyn could lose custody if found unfit.
*   **Visitation Disputes:** Potential conflicts arising from the exercise of visitation rights and the requirement for written consent for outings.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The implementation of the consent requirement for the father to take the child out during visitation may prove a source of conflict.
*   The application of substitute parental authority provisions to the illegitimate father requires careful consideration of the "best interests of the child."

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Pablo-Gualberto v. Gualberto V, 500 Phil. 226 (2005):** Misinterpreted by the petitioners.
*   **Briones v. Miguel, 483 Phil. 483 (2004):** Cited in Pablo-Gualberto.
*   **Bagtas v. Santos, 621 Phil. 94 (2009):** Emphasizes the need for trial before awarding custody.
*   **Sombong v. CA, 322 Phil. 737 (1996):** Discusses the equitable nature of custody cases.
*   **Grande v. Antonio, 727 Phil. 448 (2014)** the requirement for the consent of the mother is consistent with the regime of sole maternal custody

**Statutory References:**

*   Family Code: Articles 176, 213, 214, 216.
*   Rules of Court: Rule 99, Section 6 (interpreted in relation to custody).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision to remand the case for trial, emphasizing the need to determine the mother's fitness and the child's best interests. The court clarified the applicability of the tender-age presumption under Article 213 of the Family Code and underscored the importance of a full trial before determining custody. The SC also modified the CA decision by deleting the grant of limited and temporary custody to the father, finding it premature. The court upheld his visitation rights.
