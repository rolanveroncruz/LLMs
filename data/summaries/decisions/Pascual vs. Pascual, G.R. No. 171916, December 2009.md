**Case Summary: Pascual v. Pascual, G.R. No. 171916, December 4, 2009 (622 Phil. 307)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 to annul the CA decision nullifying the RTC's judgment in favor of the petitioner in a Specific Performance case.

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC validly acquired jurisdiction over the respondent through substituted service of summons.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision, holding that the RTC did *not* acquire jurisdiction over the respondent because the substituted service of summons was defective. Consequently, the RTC judgment was void.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 14, Sections 6 & 7 (Personal and Substituted Service):** The decision hinges on the strict application of these rules. The SC reiterated that personal service is the primary method, and substituted service is only permissible when personal service is impossible after diligent efforts.

*   **Manotoc v. Court of Appeals, G. R. No. 130974, August 16, 2006, 499 SCRA 21:** The SC extensively cites this case, breaking down the requirements for valid substituted service:

    1.  **Impossibility of Prompt Personal Service:** The process server's return must demonstrate diligent attempts at personal service over a reasonable period (around one month) and explain why those attempts failed. At least three attempts on at least two different dates are required.
    2.  **Specific Details in the Return:** The return *must* describe the efforts made, including dates, times, inquiries, occupants of the residence, and all futile acts. A general statement is insufficient.  Referenced  *Hamilton v. Levy, G.R. No. 139283, November 15, 2000, 344 SCRA 821*, emphasizing that the return must state the pertinent facts and circumstances, otherwise it cannot be upheld. This is considered extraordinary in character and must follow the requirements.
    3.  **Person of Suitable Age and Discretion:** If service is at the residence, it must be to someone of legal age (18) with sufficient discernment to understand the summons' importance. They must know how to read and understand English.
    4.  **Competent Person in Charge:** If service is at the office/business, it must be to someone managing the business with sufficient knowledge.

*   **Defective Returns:** The process server's returns were deficient. They failed to demonstrate impossibility of prompt personal service. The Returns did not indicate the actual exertion or any positive steps taken by the officer or process server in serving the summons personally to the defendant.

*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The SC held that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions *only* applies if the service of summons complies strictly with the prescribed procedure. Because there was no compliance, the presumption was inapplicable. Cites *Sandoval II v. HRET, et al., 433 Phil. 290, 309 (2002)*.

*   **Void Judgment:** Because the RTC lacked jurisdiction over the respondent's person, the judgment was void ab initio and can never become final. *Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company v. Alejo, G.R. No. 141970, September 10, 2001, 364 SCRA 812*

*   **Propriety of Certiorari:**  Certiorari under Rule 65 was the proper remedy because the RTC judgment was void; therefore, the doctrine of finality of judgment was inapplicable.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "Reasonable Time":** The SC relies on the interpretation in *Manotoc* of "reasonable time" for personal service.  While the *Manotoc* case sets a benchmark of "at least three tries, preferably on at least two different dates," within a month, the facts constituting diligent effort remain subjective.  A process server's failure to fully document efforts is a critical risk factor.
*   **Forum Shopping Allegation:** The respondent raised forum shopping but was not a critical element in the SC's decision.

**Obligations:**

*   Process servers must meticulously document all efforts to effect personal service and provide detailed explanations in the Return of Summons to justify substituted service.

**Liabilities:**

*   A judgment rendered without proper service of summons and without the court acquiring jurisdiction over the person of the defendant is void and can be challenged at any time.

**Conclusion:**

This case reinforces the stringent requirements for substituted service of summons. It highlights the importance of proper documentation by process servers and provides a basis for challenging judgments where jurisdiction over the defendant's person was not properly established. The key takeaway is that substantial compliance is *not* sufficient; strict compliance with Rule 14 is required.
