## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Begino* G.R. No. 181246 (2009)

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court decision affirming conviction for statutory rape, modifying the penalty and basis for the lower court's ruling.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction:** Remeias Begino was found guilty of statutory rape under Article 266-A(1)(d) of the Revised Penal Code (carnal knowledge of a woman under 12 years of age), punishable by *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Qualifying Circumstances:** The initial charge and lower court rulings attempted to apply the death penalty under Art. 266-B(1) based on the victim being under 18 and the offender being the "step-parent."
*   **Relationship:** The Supreme Court rejected the characterization of Begino as a "step-parent," as the prosecution proved that he was the common-law spouse, not a step-parent which presumes a legitimate marriage to the victim's mother.
*   **Pleading Requirement:** Because the information only alleged "step-parent" and not "common-law spouse," the Court held that the prosecution failed to properly plead the qualifying circumstance required to impose the penalty under Art. 266-B(1). The court cited *People v. Garcia* (346 Phil. 475 (1997)) to emphasize that failure to properly plead a qualifying circumstance would be a denial of the accused's right to be informed of the charges against him.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Begino is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Begino is liable for P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages, and P30,000 as exemplary damages to the victim (AAA).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Procedural Error:** The initial charge and lower court rulings attempted to impose the death penalty based on an improperly pleaded qualifying circumstance. This error was rectified on appeal, but demonstrates a potential risk of due process violations.
*   **Factual Dispute:** The defense raised an alibi, claiming Begino was working at a coconut plantation. However, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals found the alibi unconvincing and the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the defense witnesses undermined their credibility.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:** Articles 266-A, 266-B (Rape, penalties for Rape)
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** (Prohibition of the Death Penalty)
*   **People v. Garcia,** 346 Phil. 475 (1997): Qualifying circumstances must be properly pleaded in the indictment.
*   **People v. Ferolino,** 386 Phil. 161 (2000): The circumstances that qualify a crime should be alleged and proved beyond reasonable doubt as the crime itself.
*   **People v. Bayya,** 384 Phil. 519 (2000): The age of the victim and her relationship with the offender must be both alleged in the information and proven during the trial, otherwise, the death penalty cannot be imposed
*   **People v. Radam, Jr.,** 434 Phil. 87 (2002). A "stepfather" is the husband of one's mother by virtue of a marriage subsequent to that of which the person spoken of is the offspring. It presupposes a legitimate relationship between the appellant and the victim's mother.

**Legal Precision and Key Takeaways:**

*   The case underscores the importance of accurately pleading qualifying circumstances in a criminal information to ensure due process.
*   Failure to properly plead and prove qualifying circumstances limits the conviction to the basic offense, in this case, statutory rape under Art. 266-A(1)(d).
*   While the death penalty was avoided due to RA 9346, the procedural missteps highlight potential pitfalls in charging decisions.
* The Court emphasized the importance of the trial court's evaluation of witness credibility, which is given a "badge of respect" because they have a better position to observe the demeanor of the witnesses as they testify.
