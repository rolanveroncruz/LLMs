## Legal Document Summary: People v. YYY (G.R. No. 262941)

This Supreme Court decision affirms the conviction of YYY for violation of Sections 4(a), (b), and (c) of RA 9775 (Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009) in relation to Section 16 of the same law and Section 4(c)(2) of RA 10175 (Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012), qualified by the use of a computer system. The crime involves YYY inducing a minor niece, AAA, to perform sexual acts for online customers.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Factual Basis:** The FBI traced YYY's email to the Philippines, revealing the sale of nude photos of minor girls. A subsequent police operation led to the rescue of three minors and the seizure of computer equipment and related items. Victim AAA testified she was coerced by YYY to perform sexual acts in front of a webcam.
*   **Elements of Child Pornography Proven:** The prosecution successfully established that AAA was a minor, that YYY induced and coerced her to perform in the creation of child pornography, and that the sexual acts were represented visually.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The court upheld the validity of the search warrant, finding that the issuing judge personally determined probable cause after examining the applicant and witnesses.
*   **Repeal and Re-enactment:** RA 9775 was repealed by RA 11930 (Anti-Online Sexual Abuse or Exploitation of Children (OSAEC) and Anti-Child Sexual Abuse or Exploitation Materials (CSAEM) Act). However, the Court holds that the *reenactment of similar prohibited acts* in RA 11930 means the criminal liability under the old law is not extinguished. Citing *United States v. Cuna, 12 Phil. 241, 245 (1908)* and *Benedicto v. Court of Appeals, 416 Phil. 722 (2001)*, the ruling highlights that the reenactment neutralized the repeal and continued the law in force without interruption.
*   **Defenses Rejected:** YYY's defense of denial was deemed self-serving. The imprecise date of the crime in the information was not considered fatal, as time is not an essential element.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** YYY is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Penalty:** Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* and a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00.
*   **Civil Liability:** Ordered to pay the victim, AAA, civil indemnity of PHP 100,000.00, moral damages of PHP 100,000.00, and exemplary damages of PHP 100,000.00, all with 6% interest per annum from finality.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **None Explicit in the Decision:** There is no express ambiguity or open-endedness noted in the document. The decision is explicit and resolute.
*   **Implication and Enforecment:** Even if the crime in this case was performed between the repeal and re-enactment, this legal decision solidifies the importance of the enforcement of RA 11930.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9775:** Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 (repealed, but the basis for conviction).
*   **RA 10175:** Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Section 4(c)(2) used for qualifying the offense with use of a computer system).
*   **RA 11930:** Anti-Online Sexual Abuse or Exploitation of Children (OSAEC) and Anti-Child Sexual Abuse or Exploitation Materials (CSAEM) Act (repealed RA 9775 but re-enacted similar provisions).
*   **United States v. Cuna, 12 Phil. 241, 245 (1908):** Case cited regarding the effect of repeal and re-enactment on criminal liability.
*   **Benedicto v. Court of Appeals, 416 Phil. 722 (2001):** Another case cited on the implications of repeal and re-enactment of statutes.
*   **A.M. No. 00-5-03-SC, Rule 126, sec. 4:** Rules of search warrant application and procedure.

**Conclusion:**

This decision reinforces the state's commitment to protecting children from sexual exploitation. It confirms the admissibility of evidence obtained under a valid search warrant and, importantly, clarifies that the repeal and re-enactment of child pornography laws does not extinguish criminal liability for offenses committed under the repealed law. This is crucial for ongoing prosecutions.
