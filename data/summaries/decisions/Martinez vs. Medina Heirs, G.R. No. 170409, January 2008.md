## Legal Document Summary: *Gregoria Martinez v. Hon. Court of Appeals, et al.* (G.R. No. 170409, January 28, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari seeking to overturn the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order cancelling Original Certificates of Title (OCTs) issued in the name of Gregoria Martinez.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Cancellation of Titles:** The primary outcome is the cancellation of OCT Nos. P-5518, P-5519, and P-5482 issued to Petitioner Gregoria Martinez (under the name Martinez, when her true surname is Merquines).
*   **Grounds for Cancellation:** The basis for cancellation is *fraud* and *misrepresentation* by the Petitioner in her application for free patents. Specifically, she misrepresented herself as an heir of Celedonia Martinez, the original owner of the properties.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Title:** The Petitioner definitively loses ownership rights to the parcels of land covered by the cancelled titles.
*   **Potential for Reversion to the State:** While the lower court indicated that an action for reversion to the State could follow, the instant action *not* an action for reversion.
*   **Potential Criminal Liability:** The CA noted Petitioner committed perjury by lying about her lineage. This raises the potential for prosecution, although this was not the subject of this case.
*   **Preclusion (Estoppel):** The court emphasized that issues not raised at the trial court cannot be brought for the first time on appeal. The Petitioner failed to raise the issues of the Director of Lands as an indispensable party and the alleged indefeasibility of the titles at the trial level.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141):** This is the governing statute for the disposition of public lands. The decision references Sections 44 and 48(b) specifically relating to free patents and confirmation of imperfect titles.
*   **Property Registration Decree:** Referenced to describe that application for judicial confirmation of imperfect titles may be done in court.
*   **Republic Act No. 6940:** Cited regarding amendments to the Public Land Act concerning requirements for administrative confirmation of title.
*   **Republic Act No. 9176:** Cited in regards to the area of land that may be subject to judicial confirmation.
*   **Evangelista v. Santiago (G.R. No. 157447, 29 April 2005):** Distinguishes between an action for declaration of nullity of free patents and certificates of title and an action for reversion. This is crucial because in an action for reversion, the Director of Lands is an indispensable party.
*   **Apuyan v. Haldeman (G.R. No. 129980, 20 September 2004):** Establishes that a certificate of title obtained through fraud is not cloaked with indefeasibility.
*   **Meneses v. Court of Appeals (316 Phil. 210, 1995):** Similarly, the indefeasibility principle is unavailable when fraud is involved in the issuance of free patents and titles.
*   **Heirs of Naga√±o v. Court of Appeals (346 Phil. 724):** The real nature of the complaint is for nullification of free patent and title, not an action for reversion.
*   **PAL v. NLRC, et. al., (328 Phil. 814, 1996):** Regarding the raising of issues for the first time on appeal.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The observation that an action for reversion of the disputed lands back to the public domain would be the next step following cancellation of the titles is not part of the dispositive portion. This creates some ambiguity because if the plaintiffs truly have ownership rights over the land, an action for reversion back to the State would be improper.

**Overall Assessment:**

The decision is unfavorable to the Petitioner. Her titles were cancelled due to fraud and misrepresentation, and her arguments on appeal were deemed waived for failure to raise them earlier. The potential for an action for reversion of the disputed lands back to the public domain remains but will depend on the strength of the respondents' land rights.
