## Legal Document Summary: *Bernardino V. Navarro vs. P.V. Pajarillo Liner, Inc.* (G.R. No. 164681, April 24, 2009)

**Case Summary:** This case involves a petition for review on certiorari concerning a bus driver, Bernardino V. Navarro, who was constructively dismissed by his employer, P.V. Pajarillo Liner, Inc. The central issue is whether Navarro is entitled to backwages despite the constructive dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Employment:** Navarro was employed as a bus driver on April 20, 1995.
*   **Traffic Violations:** Navarro was apprehended twice for traffic violations (illegal terminal), resulting in license confiscation.
*   **Alleged Agreement:** Navarro claimed he entrusted his TVR to the employer's Operations Manager (Hegina) for redemption, based on company policy. The company denies such policy.
*   **Constructive Dismissal:** After a second apprehension and issues with redeeming his license, Navarro was effectively prevented from working. The Labor Arbiter (LA) initially found illegal dismissal with backwages.
*   **NLRC Modification:** The NLRC affirmed constructive dismissal and reinstatement *without* backwages, finding Navarro partially at fault for not redeeming his license.
*   **CA Affirmance:** The Court of Appeals (CA) upheld the NLRC decision, denying backwages.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's Alleged Duty to Redeem License:** Navarro argues the employer had a customary or implicit duty to redeem licenses for certain violations. The company disputes this, claiming it was a mere accommodation.
*   **Employee's Duty to Mitigate Damages:** The core finding against Navarro is his failure to diligently pursue the redemption of his driver's license, contributing to his inability to work.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of Company Policy:** The existence and scope of a company policy regarding license redemption are unclear. The affidavit of Marcelino Ibañez (one of the respondent’s drivers) suggests a policy to redeem the license for drivers. Resolution relies on the burden of proof.
*   **Conflicting Evidence Regarding TVR:** Discrepancies exist concerning the possession and eventual loss of the extended TVR. Navarro's admission that the extended TVR was stolen from him contradicts the initial claim that he had given it back to the operations manager of the company.
*   **Doctrine of "Fair Day's Wage for a Fair Day's Labor":** The court emphasized this principle in denying backwages, finding Navarro unable to work due to his own inaction.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The court references Manila Electric Co. v. National Labor Relations Commission, Cathedral School of Technology v. National Labor Relations Commission, and Durabuilt Recapping and Plant Company v. National Labor Relations Commission, to justify denying backwages even in cases of illegal dismissal. The cases mentioned relate to denying back wages based on factors such as the employee’s negligence.
*   The decision hinges on the interpretation and application of constructive dismissal principles under the Labor Code, particularly the concept of "just cause" for termination.

**Legal Precision & Key Arguments:**

The CA affirmed the NLRC's decision to deny backwages, even though the constructive dismissal was not questioned by the respondents on appeal, because Navarro failed to take reasonable steps to retrieve his driver's license. His negligence in this regard precluded him from claiming backwages based on the "fair day's wage for a fair day's labor" principle. While the court acknowledges a constructive dismissal occurred, the petitioner's own conduct contributed to the situation.

**Areas for further Investigation:**

*   Investigate the details of the company’s policy regarding redeeming driver’s licenses.
*   Examine evidence to establish the extent of the company's accommodation regarding redeeming the license.
*   Review details regarding what steps Navarro took to redeem the licenses and whether he had any challenges in redeeming them.
