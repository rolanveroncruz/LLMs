**Case Summary: *People v. Bongos*, G.R. No. 227698 (2018)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC conviction of Hernando Bongos for the complex crime of Robbery with Rape under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code.

**Facts:** Bongos, along with a co-accused (Dexisne), entered the victim's (AAA) employer's house, robbed AAA of P20,000 at gunpoint and knifepoint, and subsequently raped her after dragging her outside. Bongos pleaded alibi, claiming he was elsewhere. The RTC and CA convicted Bongos based on AAA's testimony and circumstantial evidence.

**Key Provisions/Elements:**

*   **Robbery with Rape (Art. 294(1), RPC):** Requires (1) taking of personal property with violence or intimidation, (2) property belongs to another, (3) intent to gain (animus lucrandi), and (4) rape committed on the occasion of the robbery. *People v. Suyu, 530 Phil. 569, 596 (2006)*
* The evidence in the case was deemed enough to prove the elements of the crime. AAA testified to the events of the robbery and subsequent rape.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Convicted of Robbery with Rape; sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:** Ordered to return P20,000 (stolen amount), P100,000 as civil indemnity, P100,000 as moral damages, and P100,000 as exemplary damages to AAA, and P50,000.00 as moral damages and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages to spouses BBB and CCC.
*   **Interest:** 6% per annum on all damages from finality of judgment.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code** (Robbery with Rape)

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence of Rape:** AAA was unconscious during the alleged rape. The conviction relies heavily on circumstantial evidence (being dragged outside, forced undressing, regaining consciousness naked and in pain). Defense counsel might argue that this evidence is insufficient to prove rape beyond a reasonable doubt, since there was no witness who can attest that rape did indeed happen.
*   **Alibi:** The defense of alibi failed. The court found that there was no physical impossibility to be at the scene of the crime.
*   **Delay in Reporting Rape:** While the Court acknowledges the victim's explanation for the 9-day delay in reporting the rape (fear of threats), the defense may argue that this delay casts doubt on the veracity of the rape allegation, particularly given the lack of direct evidence.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The information did not allege dwelling as an aggravating circumstance, which was proven during the trial.

**Conspiracy:** The Courts a quo were in agreement in the findings of conspiracy between the accused and Bongos, as there was clear coordination of their actions in taking the personal effects of BBB and CCC, and rape was committed on the occasion thereof.
