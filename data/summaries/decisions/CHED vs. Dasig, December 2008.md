## Legal Document Summary: CHED vs. Dasig, G.R. No. 172776 (2008)

**Case Overview:** This is a petition for review filed by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) decision that found Atty. Felina Dasig, a CHED employee, liable only for simple misconduct instead of the more serious charges of dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, which led to her dismissal by CHED and upheld by the Civil Service Commission (CSC).  The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately GRANTED the petition, reinstating the CHED's original decision to dismiss Dasig.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Alleged Anomalous Activities:** Dasig, while OIC of the Legal Affairs Service (LAS), allegedly solicited money from students for correction of names in academic records and attempted to persuade her staff to participate in anomalous activities.
*   **CHED Investigation:** CHED formed a hearing committee which found substantial evidence of dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
*   **CSC Upholds CHED:** The CSC upheld the CHED's decision to dismiss Dasig.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA reversed the CSC decision, finding Dasig liable only for simple misconduct, characterizing her actions as "moonlighting" by offering legal services privately. The CA reduced the penalty to a six-month suspension.
*   **SC Reversal:** The SC reversed the CA decision, finding that the CA had erred in disregarding the Supreme Court's prior disbarment of Dasig based on similar facts.

**Obligations:**

*   **Public Officials:** Public officials have an obligation to conduct themselves with utmost integrity and avoid even the appearance of impropriety.
*   **Subordinate Courts:** Subordinate courts are obligated to follow the rulings and doctrines established by the Supreme Court (doctrine of *stare decisis*).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Dasig was found liable for dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, leading to her dismissal. This carries cancellation of civil service eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and perpetual disqualification from reemployment in government service.
*   **Professional Liability:** She was also disbarred for gross misconduct and dishonesty in violation of the Attorney's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility, based on the same core allegations of extortion.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Conflicting Factual Findings:** The CA's divergent factual findings from the SC's disbarment proceeding created a risk of inconsistent application of justice and undermined the authority of the SC.
*   **Erosion of Public Trust:** Failure to hold public officials accountable for misconduct erodes public trust in government institutions.
*   **Procedural Due Process:** While Dasig argued she was denied due process, the SC noted she was afforded opportunity to respond in both the administrative and disbarment proceedings.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 (Rules of Court):**  The basis for the petition for review to the SC.
*   **Rule 43 (Rules of Court):** The basis for the petition for review to the CA.
*   **Rule 108 (Rules of Court):** Discussed in the context of whether the procedure for correction of entries in the civil registry applied to the situation in the case.
*   **Rule 129, Sec. 1 (Rules of Court):** Judicial Notice - SC noted CA had a duty to take judicial notice of the disbarment case findings.
*   **Rule 133 Section 5 (Rules of Court):** Defines Substantial Evidence - SC held administrative findings were supported by such evidence
*   **Rule 139-B (Rules of Court):** Proceedings for disbarment.
*   **Section 58 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:**  Outlines administrative disabilities inherent in certain penalties, including dismissal.
*   **Atty. Vitriolo v. Atty. Dasig, 448 Phil. 199 (2003):**  The disbarment case against Dasig, the findings of which the SC held the CA should have followed.
*   ***Stare decisis et non quieta movere***:  Doctrine invoked by the SC, requiring lower courts to follow established precedent.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Moonlighting" Argument:** The CA's interpretation of Dasig's actions as "moonlighting" was highly contentious and ultimately rejected by the SC.  There was no clear evidence to support this characterization, and Dasig herself initially denied offering legal services.
*   **Due Process Argument:** While the SC found Dasig was afforded due process, the lack of participation in the disbarment proceedings was used as a justification by the CA to disregard the SC ruling. The SC refuted that argument.

**Conclusion:**

The SC's decision reinforces the importance of holding public officials to high ethical standards and upholding the doctrine of *stare decisis*. The Court emphasized that the CA erred by substituting its factual findings for those of the Supreme Court in a related disbarment case involving the same core allegations. The case clarifies that attempts to solicit money under the guise of attorney's fees for services that a public official is already obligated to provide constitutes serious misconduct warranting dismissal.
