## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 166866

**Case:** Republic of the Philippines (PEZA) v. Antonio and Lili Florendo

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of PEZA's petition for Certiorari and Prohibition against RTC orders executing a final judgment in an expropriation case (Civil Case No. 2415-L).

**Background:**

*   PEZA's predecessor filed an expropriation complaint for 7 parcels of land owned by the Florendos under RA 7916.
*   RTC initially ordered expropriation with just compensation at P1,500/sqm, plus 12% interest from March 12, 1992.
*   Pending appeal (CA-G.R. CV No. 54765), parties entered into a compromise agreement: P1,500/sqm valuation, respondents waived interest, respondents would present clean titles.
*   A deed of absolute sale (June 25, 2001) was executed for one lot (Lot 4704).
*   Payment for Lot Nos. 4705-H, 4709, and 4710 was made, and titles transferred.
*   PEZA prepared a joint motion to dismiss, but Florendo refused to sign because 3 lots remained unpaid due to pending third-party claims hindering clean titles.
*   PEZA found respondents' counter-proposal to execute a partial compromise agreement unacceptable
*   CA, unaware of the compromise agreement, modified the RTC decision, setting fair market value at P1,000/sqm (June 25, 2002). This decision became final.
*   Respondents filed a motion for execution concerning the remaining 3 lots (Lot Nos. 4703-B-part, 4702-C, and 4702-B).
*   RTC granted the motion, leading to garnishment of PEZA's funds.
*   PEZA's motions to quash and lift garnishment were denied.
*   CA dismissed PEZA's petition, ordering execution but deducting prior payments for the 4 lots.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Compromise Agreement:**  The core legal issue is the validity and effect of the compromise agreement reached by the parties during the appeal process, specifically regarding the remaining three lots.
    *   **Contract of Sale:** The agreement constitutes a contract of sale as defined by Art. 1458, Civil Code (consent, determinate subject matter, price certain).
    *   **Clean Titles:**  Delivery of clean titles was determined to be a condition on PEZA's obligation to pay, not a condition to the perfection of the sale itself (Distinguishing between conditions of perfection vs. performance, *Jardine Davies Inc. v. CA*).
    *   **Res Judicata:** PEZA argues the compromise agreement is *res judicata* and bars execution of the CA decision.
*   **Validity of Compromise After Final Judgment:** The SC affirms the validity of a compromise agreement even after a final judgment (*Magbanua v. Uy*, citing *Jesalva v. Bautista*, *Palanca v. Court of Industrial Relations*, *Gatchalian v. Arlegui*). The compromise novates the final judgment.
*   **Execution of Judgment:** RTC orders for execution of the CA decision were invalid as they were superseded by the valid compromise agreement.

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondents:** Obligated to provide clean titles to the remaining three lots as per the compromise agreement.
*   **Petitioner (PEZA):** Obligated to pay the agreed-upon price (P1,500/sqm) *upon* delivery of clean titles for the remaining three lots.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potentially, PEZA could have been liable for the P1,000/sqm under the CA decision had the compromise agreement not been upheld.
*   Respondents would be liable for not clearing titles of the remaining three lots.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Enforceability of Compromise:** While upheld, the compromise agreement's enforceability hinges on the respondents' ability to deliver clean titles, which is currently obstructed by pending third-party claims. This could lead to further litigation or renegotiation.
*   **Third-Party Claims:** The pending third-party claims affecting the remaining three lots remain a significant risk and source of potential litigation.
*   **Supervening Event:** The Court mentioned that the Aznar case was not necessarily a supervening event because the time of filing of the original complaint could not be determined to be after the final CA decision.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7916:** Special Economic Zone Act of 1995 (PEZA's enabling statute).
*   **Civil Code, Art. 1458:** Elements of a valid contract of sale.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 2028:** Definition of a compromise agreement.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 2037:** Effect of compromise agreement as res judicata.
*   ***Jardine Davies Inc. v. CA*:** Distinction between conditions on perfection and performance of a contract.
*   ***Magbanua v. Uy*:** Validity of compromise agreement after final judgment.
*   ***Jesalva v. Bautista*, *Palanca v. Court of Industrial Relations*, *Gatchalian v. Arlegui*:** Cited in Magbanua v. Uy re: validity of compromise agreement.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA and upheld the validity of the compromise agreement, preventing execution of the CA's final judgment.  PEZA's obligation to pay for the remaining three lots is contingent upon the respondents delivering clear titles. The ongoing third-party claims present a continuing risk that must be monitored. Further negotiation may be necessary if clear titles cannot be obtained.
