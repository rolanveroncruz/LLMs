## Legal Document Summary: Republic v. Go Pei Hung (G.R. No. 212785, April 4, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) affirmation of the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) grant of Go Pei Hung's Petition for Naturalization.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) granted the petition, reversing the CA decision and dismissing Go Pei Hung's Petition for Naturalization. The SC held that strict compliance with Commonwealth Act No. 473 (CA 473), the Revised Naturalization Law, is mandatory.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 7, CA 473 (Petition for Citizenship):** Requires the applicant to attach a Certificate of Arrival to the Petition for Naturalization. This is the core issue.
*   **Section 5, CA 473 (Declaration of Intention):** Requires filing of a declaration of intention one year prior to the petition.
*   **Section 6, CA 473 (Exemptions):** Provides exemptions from the declaration of intention for individuals born and educated in the Philippines or those residing in the Philippines for 30 years or more.
*   **General Requirements (Section 2, CA 473):** The applicant must meet specific qualifications like age, residency, good moral character, property ownership/occupation, language proficiency, and enrollment of children in Philippine schools.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Failure to Attach Certificate of Arrival:** This is a fatal defect. The SC emphasized that the absence of a Certificate of Arrival renders the petition incomplete and warrants outright dismissal. It indicates a failure to prove legal entry into the Philippines.
*   **Incorrect Claim of Exemption:** While Go Pei Hung claimed exemption from filing a Declaration of Intention under Section 6 based on residency, the SC found his argument unconvincing.
*   **Lack of Evidence of Lucrative Trade/Profession:** The Republic argued that the applicant failed to sufficiently demonstrate a lucrative trade, profession, or occupation.
*   **Lack of Credible Witnesses:** The Republic also challenged the credibility of the witnesses presented by the applicant.
*   **Potential for Re-opening of Naturalization Proceedings:**  Even if naturalization is granted, the proceedings can be re-opened by the government, presenting new evidence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Commonwealth Act No. 473 (CA 473) / Revised Naturalization Law:** The controlling statute.
*   **Republic v. Huang Te Fu, 756 Phil. 309 (2015):** Cited for the principle of requiring full and complete compliance with naturalization laws.
*   **Republic v. Hong:**  Emphasized the need for strict construction of naturalization laws.
*   **Republic v. Judge De la Rosa, 302 Phil. 829 (1994):**  Reiterated that failure to attach the certificate of arrival is fatal.
*   **Chiu Tek Ye v. Republic, 147 Phil. 165, 170-171 (1971):** Failure to attach certificate of arrival nullifies the petition.
*   **Charm Chan v. Republic, 108 Phil. 882, 887 (1960):** The certificate of arrival must be made a part of the petition to prevent illegal entry.
*   **Republic v. Li Ching Chung, 707 Phil. 231 (2013):** Stressed the public interest nature of naturalization proceedings and the burden of proof on the applicant.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "continuous residence" under Section 6, CA 473:**  The applicant argued that his residency since 1973 qualified him for exemption, but the Republic disputed this, arguing that residency should be counted from the issuance of his permanent residence certificate. The SC did not rule on this directly but implied that his residency began at the time that he entered the country illegally.
*   **The requirement of having a certificate of arrival is jurisdictional. **
*   **The SC is particularly strict in naturalization cases, especially those that are illegally procured.**

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Denial of Naturalization:** The SC ultimately denied the petition due to the failure to attach the Certificate of Arrival.
*   **Future Scrutiny:** Even if citizenship were granted, the government retains the power to re-open the case and present new evidence.
*   **Challenge to Permanent Residency Status:** Though not directly ruled upon, the finding that the applicant's initial entry may have been illegal could potentially jeopardize his permanent residency status.
