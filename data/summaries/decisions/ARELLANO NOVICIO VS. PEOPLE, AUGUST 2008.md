## Legal Document Summary: *Arellano Novicio v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 163331 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the CA's affirmance of the RTC's conviction for Frustrated Homicide.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Petitioner was charged with Frustrated Homicide for shooting the private complainant, Mario Mercado.
*   **Conflicting Versions:** Prosecution alleged petitioner shot Mercado without provocation. Defense claimed self-defense, asserting Mercado drew a gun first and the shooting occurred during a struggle.
*   **Injury:** Mercado sustained a single gunshot wound entering the right pubic area and exiting the left gluteus.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found petitioner guilty of Frustrated Homicide, rejecting the self-defense claim due to inconsistencies in defense witness testimonies and crediting the prosecution's version. It considered the location of the wound and the weapon used as indicators of intent to kill.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision, upholding the trial court's findings of fact and credibility assessments.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioner had the obligation to prove self-defense by clear and convincing evidence, as the burden shifted to him upon admitting the shooting. (Citing *Andrada v. People*, 452 SCRA 685 (2005)).
*   Prosecution had the obligation to prove intent to kill beyond reasonable doubt to establish frustrated homicide. (Citing *Rivera v. People*, 480 SCRA 188 (2006)).

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner found liable for Frustrated Homicide.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Self-Defense Claim:** The central issue is the validity of the self-defense claim. The courts found the defense evidence inconsistent and incredible.
*   **Intent to Kill:** The CA and RTC inferred intent to kill from the use of a firearm, the location and nature of the wound, and the need for advanced medical treatment. Petitioner argued that the medical testimony (“possibly fatal”) was insufficient proof of intent. The Supreme Court relied on existing jurisprudence (*Adame v. Hon. Court of Appeals*, 440 Phil. 827 (2002)) to consider the circumstances surrounding the shooting.
*   **Factual Findings:** The decision relies heavily on the factual findings of the RTC, which were affirmed by the CA. Rule 45 allows for review only on questions of law. The SC held that no exceptions were made to the doctrine.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 45:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari.
*   **Revised Penal Code provisions on Homicide and Frustrated Homicide:** Defines the crimes and their elements.
*   ***Andrada v. People*, G.R. No. 135222, March 4, 2005:**  Establishes burden of proof when invoking self-defense.
*   ***Rivera v. People*, G.R. No. 166326, January 25, 2006:** Discusses the element of intent to kill in crimes against persons.
*   ***Adame v. Hon. Court of Appeals*, 440 Phil. 827 (2002):** Case used to justify intent through single gunshot wound, where it was found as Frustrated Homicide.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The medical testimony that the wound was "possibly fatal" leaves room for argument regarding the certainty of the risk of death, which is essential for establishing frustrated homicide. However, the SC found it reasonable based on the need for transfer to another hospital.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, finding no reversible error in the lower courts' decisions. The central issue revolved around conflicting factual accounts and the court's credibility assessment of the witnesses. The self-defense claim failed due to inconsistencies and the prosecution successfully established intent to kill based on circumstantial evidence and the potentially fatal nature of the wound. Given the factual nature of the case and the concurrent findings of the lower courts, overturning the conviction would have been difficult.
