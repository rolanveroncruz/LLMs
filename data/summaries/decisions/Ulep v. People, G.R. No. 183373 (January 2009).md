**Case Summary: *Gilda C. Ulep v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 183373 (2009)**

**Nature:** Resolution on motion for reconsideration of a denial of a petition for review on certiorari regarding the CA's dismissal of an appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Conviction:** Petitioner, a government employee below salary grade 27, was convicted by the RTC for malversation of public funds under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Appeal:** Petitioner filed a notice of appeal stating the judgment was contrary to law and evidence. The RTC erroneously forwarded the records to the Court of Appeals (CA).
*   **CA Ruling:** The CA dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, holding that appeals in malversation cases (public office-related crimes under PD 1606 as amended by RA 8249) should be to the Sandiganbayan.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Petitioner argued the CA should have transferred the records to the Sandiganbayan instead of dismissing the appeal. The omission in specifying the proper court was inadvertent.
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) granted the motion for reconsideration, setting aside the CA's dismissal. The SC held that the designation of the appellate court in the notice of appeal is directory, citing *Heirs of Pizarro v. Consolacion* (161 SCRA 186). The failure to specify the Sandiganbayan was not fatal. The RTC erred in forwarding the records to the CA. The CA was directed to remand the case to the RTC for transmittal to the Sandiganbayan. The RTC judge was warned against future errors.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** To diligently pursue her appeal in the Sandiganbayan after the case is transmitted.
*   **RTC's Obligation:** To forward the records to the Sandiganbayan promptly.
*   **RTC Judge's Liability:** Potential administrative sanctions for failing to properly forward the case to the correct appellate court initially.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** While resolved in this decision, the initial jurisdictional error caused significant delay and potential prejudice to the petitioner's right to appeal.
*   **Ambiguity in Notice of Appeal:** While the SC ruled the designation of the proper court is directory, ambiguities or errors in the notice of appeal can still cause delays or complications. Counsel should ensure clarity in future filings.
*   **Continuing Litigation:** This decision only addresses the procedural error. The merits of the petitioner's appeal against her conviction are still pending determination in the Sandiganbayan.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code:** Malversation of public funds.
*   **PD 1606 (as amended by RA 8249):** Jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. Specifically, Section 4 regarding public office-related crimes.
*   **Heirs of Pizarro v. Consolacion, 161 SCRA 186:** Held that indicating the court to which an appeal is being made is merely directory.
*   **Moll v. Buban, 436 Phil. 627 (2002) and Arriola and Radan v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 165711, 30 June 2006, 494 SCRA 344:** Reiterates that error in designation of the court does not affect the validity of the notice of appeal.

**Analysis for Lawyer:**

This case highlights the importance of proper designation of appellate courts and the potential consequences of jurisdictional errors. While the SC adopted a liberal interpretation in favor of the accused, it underscores the responsibility of the RTC to ensure cases are forwarded to the correct appellate court. Defense counsel should be prepared to argue procedural errors and potential prejudice to the client in similar cases. Furthermore, this case shows the Supreme Court's willingness to relax procedural rules in criminal cases when a person's liberty is at stake. However, despite the favorable ruling, the client must understand that the actual appeal against the conviction is still pending and requires diligent pursuit in the Sandiganbayan.
