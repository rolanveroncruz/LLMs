## Legal Document Summary: Lajave Agricultural Management and Development Enterprises, Inc. vs. Spouses Javellana

**Document:** G.R. No. 223785, November 7, 2018 (842 Phil. 1119)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals Decision in an unlawful detainer and collection of sum of money case.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Lajave Agricultural Management and Development Enterprises, Inc. (Lessee)
*   **Respondents:** Spouses Agustin and Florence Apilis-Javellana (Lessor/Landowner)

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Lease Agreement (1998):** Lajave leased 7 hectares of sugar land from Agustin Javellana in Silay City, Negros Occidental, for 10 years (crop year 1988-1989 to 1997-1998) at 13 piculs of sugar per hectare annually.
*   **Post-Expiration Occupancy:** Lajave continued to occupy the Silay City property and expanded the lease to include property in Talisay City (inherited by Agustin). No new contract was executed for the additional area or after the expiration of the original contract.
*   **Demand to Vacate (2010 & 2012):** Agustin demanded Lajave vacate both Silay City and Talisay City properties. Lajave refused.
*   **Unlawful Detainer Suits (2012):** Agustin filed separate unlawful detainer complaints in MTCC Silay City and MTCC Talisay City.  Both were dismissed by the lower court.
*   **Collection of Sum of Money (2012):** Agustin filed a separate action in MeTC Quezon City to recover alleged deficiencies in rental payments from crop years 2000-2001 to 2008-2009.

**Issue:**

Can Agustin Javellana maintain a separate action for collection of sum of money (rental deficiencies prior to unlawful detainer) while unlawful detainer suits are pending, without violating the rules against splitting a single cause of action, litis pendentia, and forum shopping?

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court (SC) **denied** Lajave's petition, upholding the CA decision. The SC held that Agustin's filing of a complaint for collection of sum of money other than those sustained as a result of their dispossession or those caused by the loss of their use and occupation of their properties could not thus be considered as splitting of a cause of action. The SC ordered that the Civil Case No. 12-41648 be REINSTATED and REMANDED to the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 38, tor further proceedings.

**Legal Analysis & Rationale:**

*   **No Litis Pendentia/Forum Shopping:** The SC found no identity of causes of action between the unlawful detainer cases and the collection of money suit. Unlawful detainer relates to possession and damages *after* the demand to vacate, while the collection suit relates to rental deficiencies *before* the unlawful detainer period.
*   **No Splitting of Cause of Action:** The SC reasoned that an action for collection of sum of money may not be properly joined with the action for ejectment, noting that they are distinct actions with different procedures (full-blown trial vs. summary procedure) that are specifically enjoined under Section 5, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Damages in Unlawful Detainer:** The only recoverable damages in unlawful detainer are the fair rental value or reasonable compensation for use and occupation after the demand to vacate.
*   **Rental Calculation:** The SC observed that determining the correct rental fees and any deficiency requires a full trial (documentary and testimonial evidence), which is unsuitable for the summary nature of unlawful detainer proceedings.
*   **Reliance on *Proguard Security Services Corporation v. Tormil Realty and Development Corporation*, 738 Phil. 417 (2014):** This case emphasizes that fair rental value is only calculated from the *demand to vacate*, not from the start of occupancy.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Rental Deficiency:** The success of the collection suit depends on Agustin's ability to prove the alleged rental deficiencies for the specified period (2000-2001 to 2008-2009). The method of calculating the correct rental and proving the discrepancy based on Sugar Regulatory Administration data will be crucial.
*   **Contract Interpretation:** The original lease agreement (expired) and any implied extensions or modifications will be key in determining the terms of rental payment.

**Recommendations:**

*   As counsel for Lajave, it is crucial to contest the calculation of the rental deficiencies.
*   Scrutinize the evidence presented by the Spouses Javellana, particularly the Sugar Regulatory Administration data, to ensure its accuracy and applicability to the specific lease agreement.
*   Argue that the original contract of lease should not be the basis for alleged rental deficiencies, considering the informal nature of lease renewals.
*   Research any evidence that payments were made and/or accepted and that such payments may be treated as the fair rental value.
