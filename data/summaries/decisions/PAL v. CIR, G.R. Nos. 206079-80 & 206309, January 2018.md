**Case Summary: Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL) v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue**
**G.R. Nos. 206079-80 & 206309, January 17, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari regarding PAL's claim for refund of final taxes withheld on interest income from bank deposits.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**
*   **Main Issue:** Whether PAL is required to prove the remittance to the Bureau of Internal Revenue of the final withholding tax on its interest from currency bank deposits to be entitled to tax refund?
*   **PAL's Franchise (P.D. No. 1590, Sec. 13):** Grants tax exemptions to PAL, allowing it to pay either basic corporate income tax or a 2% franchise tax "in lieu of all other taxes," including taxes on interest income. This remains valid even after subsequent legislative amendments regarding excise taxes and franchise tax abolition, as per *CIR v. PAL* (various G.R. Nos.).
*   **Final Withholding Tax:** Interest income is subject to final withholding tax (NIRC Sec. 27(D)(1); RR No. 02-98, Sec. 2.57.1(G)). Under the final withholding tax system the amount of income tax withheld by the withholding agent is constituted as a full and final payment of the income tax due from the payee on the said income. The liability for payment of the tax rests primarily on the payor as a withholding agent (RR No. 02-98, Sec. 2.57(A)).
* **Sufficiency of Evidence presented** Certificates of Final Taxes Withheld at Source (BIR Forms No. 2036), Summary of Monthly Final Income Taxes Withheld, and Monthly Remittance Return of Final Income Taxes (BIR Form No. 1602)
*  **Issue of Evidence Admissibility at the CTA**: Whether the Court of Tax Appeals is limited by the evidence presented in the administrative claim for refund in the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
*   **Remittance:**
    *   The CTA initially ruled that PAL failed to prove the actual remittance of taxes withheld by Chinabank, PBCom, and Standard Chartered, finding that the provided documents did not specifically tie the remitted amounts to PAL's interest income.
    *   However, the Supreme Court ultimately held that *proof of remittance is not necessary* for PAL to claim a refund, relying on *CIR v. PNB* (744 Phil. 299 (2014)).
*   **BURDEN OF PROOF**. The Agent Banks, acting as withholding agents are accountable for proving remittance. PAL has no control or responsibility over the remittance of the taxes withheld.
*   **Administrative Claims**: evidence not presented in the administrative claim for refund in the Bureau of Internal Revenue can be presented in the Court of Tax Appeals;
*   **Certificate of Final Tax Withheld:** Certificates of Final Taxes Withheld issued by the Agent Banks are sufficient evidence to establish the withholding of the taxes.
*  **Perjury**  These bank-issued Certificates of Income Tax Withheld and BIR Forms were neither disputed nor alleged to be false or fraudulent. These Certificates were declared under the penalty of perjury. As such, they may be taken at face value.
*   **Ruling:** Despite the CTA's factual findings, the Supreme Court granted PAL's petition, emphasizing that requiring PAL to prove actual remittance effectively shifted the burden of proof and oversight to the taxpayer.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**
*   **Withholding Agent (Agent Banks):** Primarily liable for withholding and remitting taxes to the BIR (RR No. 02-98, Sec. 2.57(A)).
*   **Philippine Airlines** The only obligation of Philippine Airlines is to prove the fact that the taxes were withheld
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue:** Required to refund or credit excess tax payments made by PAL (P.D. No. 1590, Sec. 14).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**
*   **CTA Factual Findings:** The CTA's initial factual findings regarding a lack of specific proof of remittance for certain banks could pose a risk if not overturned, although the Supreme Court ultimately dismissed this concern.
*   **Reliance on Case Law:** The Supreme Court's heavy reliance on *CIR v. PNB* may be subject to future challenges or distinctions in different factual contexts.
*   **Statutory Interpretation:** The interpretation of P.D. No. 1590 and subsequent amendments might be subject to differing views, particularly regarding the scope of the "in lieu of all other taxes" clause.
*   **Inconsistencies in Documentary Evidence** The fact that the amount of final income tax withheld from petitioner cannot be ascertained with particularity from the total amount of final withholding taxes that were remitted to the BIR by China Banking Corporation, Philippine Bank of Communication[s), and Standard Chartered Bank
*   **Diligence of Bureau of Internal Revenue** PAL further submits that assuming it failed to present the remittance returns on final income tax withheld, the Commissioner could have retrieved these files from the records, as these are monthly returns filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue. As the Chief of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Commissioner has access to all tax returns including those of final income tax withheld at source, and thus, is in bad faith in not checking the records to determine whether or not the withheld taxes were remitted. PAL maintains that the Commissioner's denial of the withholding of the taxes is not a specific denial, and thus, should be deemed as an admission of this fact

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   Presidential Decree No. 1590
*   National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) Sec. 27(D)(1), Sec 57, Sec 58
*   Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 02-98, Sec. 2.57, Sec 2.57(A)

*   Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Asian Transmission Corporation
*   Solutio Indebiti
*   Medina v. Mayor Asistio, Jr

**Ambiguities:**
*   The court recognized that the finding are contrary to substantial justice, equity, and fair play

**Conclusion:**
PAL is entitled to a refund because as a statutory exemption grantee, Philippine Airlines needs only to prove the fact that the taxes were withheld.
