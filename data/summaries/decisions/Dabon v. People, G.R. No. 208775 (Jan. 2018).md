**Case Summary: *Jorge Dabon v. The People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 208775, January 22, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari questioning the CA's affirmation of the RTC's conviction of Jorge Dabon for violations of Sections 11 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs) and 12 (Possession of Drug Paraphernalia), Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Issue:** Admissibility of evidence seized during a search conducted pursuant to a warrant. The Supreme Court held the evidence inadmissible, reversing Dabon's conviction.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 2, Article III of the 1987 Constitution:** Guarantees the right against unreasonable searches and seizures.
*   **Section 8, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court:** Mandates that a search of a house, room, or premise be made in the presence of the lawful occupant, a member of his/her family, or in the absence of either, two witnesses of sufficient age and discretion residing in the same locality. This provision establishes a clear hierarchy of preferred witnesses.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Violation of Constitutional Rights:** Failure to adhere to the requirements of Section 8, Rule 126, renders the search unreasonable, violating the accused's constitutional rights. (See *People v. Go*, 457 Phil. 885 (2003); *People v. Del Castillo*, 482 Phil. 828 (2004); *Bulauitan v. People*, G.R. No. 218891, September 19, 2016, 803 SCRA 367).
*   **Exclusionary Rule (Section 3(2), Article III of the 1987 Constitution):** Evidence obtained in violation of the right against unreasonable searches and seizures is inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Sections 11 & 12, Article II:** Defines the crimes of possession of dangerous drugs and possession of drug paraphernalia.
*   **Rule 126, Section 8, Rules of Court:** Outlines the procedure for conducting searches of premises.
*   ***People v. Go*, 457 Phil. 885 (2003); *People v. Del Castillo*, 482 Phil. 828 (2004); *Bulauitan v. People*, G.R. No. 218891, September 19, 2016, 803 SCRA 367; *Ogayon v. People*, 768 Phil. 272 (2015); People v. Bodoso, 446 Phil. 838 (2003):** These cases establish the mandatory nature of the witness requirement in search warrant execution and highlight the inadmissibility of evidence obtained in violation thereof.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Presence of Witnesses:** The testimonies of the police officers and Barangay Kagawad Angalot confirmed that Dabon (the occupant) and his family were not present during the search of the bedroom where the illegal items were found. While other witnesses were present, only one witness, Brgy. Kagawad Angalot, was present during the search.
*   **Waiver of Right:** The Court rejected the argument that Dabon's failure to timely object to the admissibility of the evidence constituted a waiver of his constitutional right. Citing *Ogayon v. People*, the Court emphasized that procedural rules cannot diminish substantial rights and that waivers must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Evidence Suppression:** Law enforcement agencies face the risk of having evidence suppressed if search warrants are executed improperly, particularly concerning the witness requirement. This could lead to acquittals, even in cases where illicit items are found.
*   **Civil Liability:**  While not directly addressed in this decision, improperly executing a search warrant could potentially expose law enforcement officers to civil liability for damages arising from the violation of constitutional rights.

**Conclusion:**

The *Dabon* case reinforces the strict interpretation of the rules governing the execution of search warrants and upholds the sanctity of the constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures. It serves as a cautionary tale for law enforcement agencies, emphasizing the importance of meticulous adherence to procedural safeguards to ensure the admissibility of evidence in court.
