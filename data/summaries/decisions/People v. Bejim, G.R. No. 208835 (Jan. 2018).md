## Legal Document Summary: People v. Bejim

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Noel Bejim y Romero*, G.R. No. 208835, January 19, 2018.

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA Decision affirming with modification the RTC's Consolidated Judgment finding the accused guilty of seven counts of rape. The Supreme Court partially affirmed the CA decision, finding the accused guilty of Acts of Lasciviousness and Statutory Rape.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charges:** Appellant was charged with seven counts of statutory rape based on alleged incidents in 2001.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty beyond reasonable doubt on all seven counts of rape, sentenced to reclusion perpetua for each count.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed with modification. Upgraded two counts to qualified rape and retained the conviction for statutory rape.
*   **SC Ruling:**
    *   **Reversed Rape Convictions in 5 Counts:** Due to insufficient evidence of *carnal knowledge* (penile penetration) in Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-6765, 07-CR-6766, 07-CR-6767, 07-CR-6769, and 07-CR-6770. Prosecution failed to prove the element of carnal knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt. "Grazing of the surface of the female organ or touching the mons pubis of the pudendum is not sufficient to constitute consummated rape. Absent any showing of the slightest penetration of the female organ, i.e., touching of either the labia of the pudendum by the penis, there can be no consummated rape; at most, it can only be attempted rape, if not acts of lasciviousness"
    *   **Conviction of Acts of Lasciviousness upheld for 5 counts** Under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) in relation to Section 5 of Republic Act (RA) No. 7610
    *   **Upheld Statutory Rape Convictions in 2 Counts:** Affirmed convictions in Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-6768 and 07-CR-6771 based on testimony indicating slight penetration. Cites *People v. Barberos* regarding non-requirement of complete penetration.
    *   **Penalties:**
        * Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5 of Republic Act No. 7610 in Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-6765, 07-CR-6766, 07-CR-6767, 07-CR-6769 and 07-CR-6770 and sentenced in each case to an indeterminate prison term of thirteen (13) years, nine (9) months and ten (10) days of reclusion temporal minimum, as minimum, to sixteen (16) years, five (5) months and nine (9) days of reclusion temporal medium, as maximum. In addition, appellant is ordered to pay the victims the amounts of Php20,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php15,000.00 as moral damages, Php15,000.00 as exemplary damages, and Php15,000.00 as fine, for each count of acts of lasciviousness.
        * Statutory Rape in Criminal Case Nos. 07-CR-6768 and 07-CR-6771 and sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua for each count and ordered to pay the offended party the amounts of Php75,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php75,000.00 as moral damages and Php75,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of rape.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Appellant is obligated to serve the prison sentences for Acts of Lasciviousness and Statutory Rape as specified above.
*   Appellant is liable for civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, and fines as specified above.
*   Appellant is ORDERED to pay the offended parties interest on all damages awarded at the legal rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Focus on Technical Definition of Carnal Knowledge:** The court heavily relies on the strict interpretation of "carnal knowledge," which is an element of rape and can be interpreted as ambiguity depending on varying factors of each case.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC): Articles 336 and 266-B (as amended) re: Acts of Lasciviousness and Rape.
*   Republic Act (RA) No. 7610: Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination. Specifically Section 5.
*   Republic Act No. 7610, An Act Providing for Stronger Deterrence And Special Protection Against Child Abuse, Exploitation And Discrimination, And for Other Purposes;
* Republic Act No. 9262, An Act Defining Violence Against Women And Their Children, Providing For Protective Measures For Victims, Prescribing Penalties Therefor, And for Other Purposes
*   Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, Rule 120, Sections 4 and 5, regarding variance between allegation and proof.
*   Indeterminate Sentence Law.
*   *People v. Barberos, People v. Campuhan, People v. Brioso,* and other cases cited establish legal precedent for defining carnal knowledge and credibility of witnesses.

**Notes:**

*   The decision highlights the importance of proving each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, specifically for rape.
*   The decision is based on testimonies of victims and lack of medical evidence of physical injury is not detrimental to a charge of rape.
