**Case Summary: *Spouses Annabelle and Linell Villaruel vs. National Labor Relations Commission and Narciso Guarino*, G.R. No. 120180, January 20, 1998**

**Key Issue:** Whether Narciso Guarino was an employee or a partner of Ideal Bakery, and whether his dismissal was illegal.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the NLRC's decision finding Guarino to be an employee who was illegally dismissed.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The NLRC correctly found that an employer-employee relationship existed based on substantial evidence. The alleged partnership was not substantiated by documentary evidence (contract of partnership, accounting records, business permits). Failure of petitioners to submit such documents led to presumption of suppression of evidence.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The NLRC correctly found that there was illegal dismissal. The petitioners failed to prove just cause or authorized cause for dismissal.
*   **Abandonment:** The Court rejected the Labor Arbiterâ€™s finding of abandonment. Guarino sought employment at another bakery *after* being told not to report to work anymore. Furthermore, Villaruel failed to serve a written notice of termination on Guarino, a requirement for abandonment cases as outlined in Sec. 2, Rule XIV, Book V of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code.
*   **Monetary Awards:** The Court upheld the NLRC's monetary awards, including backwages (limited), separation pay (1 month per year of service), salary differentials, overtime pay, holiday premium pay, 13th-month pay, and night shift differentials.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioners (Spouses Villaruel) are obligated to pay private respondent (Guarino) backwages, separation pay, salary differentials, overtime pay, holiday premium, 13th-month pay, and night shift differentials as computed by the NLRC.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable for the monetary awards due to the illegal dismissal of Guarino.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Factual Determinations Upheld:** The Supreme Court reiterated that its review under Rule 65 is limited to grave abuse of discretion and issues of jurisdiction, not correcting the NLRC's evaluation of evidence, citing *Morales vs. NLRC*, 241 SCRA 103; *Capitol Industrial Construction Group vs. NLRC*, 221 SCRA 469. The NLRC's findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence, are generally final.
*   **Suppression of Evidence:** The failure of the petitioners to submit requested documents, like the partnership agreement and business permits, created a presumption under the Rules of Evidence that such evidence would be adverse to their claim, citing *Opulencia Ice Plant and Storage vs. NLRC*, 228 SCRA 473. This can be a problematic precedent if similar failures occur in future cases.
*   **Lack of Procedural Due Process:** Petitioners' failure to serve a notice of termination for abandonment undermined their defense and contributed to the finding of illegal dismissal.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Grounds for dismissal are rooted in Labor Code.
*   **Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code, Sec. 2, Rule XIV, Book V:** Requirement for notice of termination in abandonment cases.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65:** Scope of certiorari review limited to grave abuse of discretion and jurisdiction.
*   **Opulencia Ice Plant and Storage vs. NLRC, 228 SCRA 473:**  Addresses the presumption arising from suppression of evidence.
*   **Morales vs. NLRC, 241 SCRA 103; Capitol Industrial Construction Group vs. NLRC, 221 SCRA 469:** Jurisdictional limits of Supreme Court in reviewing NLRC decisions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The computation of monetary awards by the NLRC was "assumed to be correct," which could be a point of contention if the computation is challenged in a subsequent proceeding.
