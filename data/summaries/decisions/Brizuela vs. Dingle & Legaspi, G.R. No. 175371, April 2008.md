## Legal Document Summary: Brizuela v. Dingle and Legaspi (G.R. No. 175371)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) denial of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) application. The TRO sought to prevent execution of a National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) decision pending resolution of a separate Petition for Certiorari filed with the CA.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Benito J. Brizuela, President and 49% shareholder of Philippine Media Post, Inc. (PMPI)
*   **Respondents:** Abraham Dingle and Nicandro Legaspi, former employees of PMPI.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Underlying Labor Dispute:** Respondents filed a complaint with the Labor Arbiter (LA) against PMPI and Brizuela for unpaid wages, benefits, and damages. PMPI ceased operations in 2000 due to alleged financial losses.
*   **LA Decision:** LA ruled in favor of the Respondents and ordered PMPI and Brizuela jointly and severally liable for unpaid wages, separation pay, 13th month pay and attorney's fees. The LA rejected PMPI's claim of serious business losses as basis for closure.
*   **NLRC Decision:** NLRC affirmed the LA's decision with modification. It found PMPI liable for vacation and sick leave pay in addition to the LA's award. However, it ruled that Brizuela was liable only in his official capacity, not solidarily with PMPI. NLRC upheld LA's rejection of serious business losses defense due to failure to comply with Art 283 notice requirements.
*   **CA Proceedings:** Brizuela filed a Petition for Certiorari (CA-G.R. SP No. 94005) in the CA, challenging the NLRC decision. Respondents sought execution of the NLRC decision.
*   **TRO Application:** Brizuela applied for a TRO from the CA to halt execution pending the resolution of his Petition for Certiorari. The CA denied the TRO.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** The Supreme Court upheld the CA's denial of the TRO.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **PMPI:** Liable for unpaid salaries, benefits, separation pay, and attorney's fees to the Respondents.
*   **Brizuela:** Liable in his *official capacity* as president of PMPI for the obligations of the corporation. Not held solidarily liable.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Execution of Monetary Award:** Without a TRO, the NLRC decision is executory against PMPI.
*   **Compliance with Labor Code:** Failure to comply with Article 283 of the Labor Code (notice requirements for closure) rendered the "serious business losses" defense ineffective.
*   **Corporate Veil Piercing:** While the NLRC and SC explicitly state Brizuela is only liable in his official capacity, the possibility of future attempts to pierce the corporate veil and hold him personally liable remains if PMPI lacks assets.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 283, Labor Code:** Requires employers to provide notice to employees and DOLE for closure due to business losses.
*   **Section 7, Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Grants courts the power to issue TROs and preliminary injunctions in certiorari proceedings.
*   **Section 5, Rule 58, Rules of Court:** Outlines requirements for issuing TROs, emphasizing the need to prevent great or irreparable injury.
*   **Carlos v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 168096):** Affirmed the right to move for execution even during pending certiorari.
*   **PSBA v. NLRC, 223 SCRA 305:** Business picking up and retrenchment is drastic move should no longer be resorted to.
*   **Masagana Concrete Products v. NLRC, G.R. No. 106916:** Allegation is neither equivalent to proof nor evidence
*   **Art. 111 of the Labor Code:** Award of 10% attorney's fees shall be based on unpaid salaries, 13th month pay and vacation/sick leaves.
*   **Gaoiran v. Alcala (419 SCRA 354):** What is repugnant to due process is the denial of the opportunity to be heard.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The extent of Brizuela's liability "in his official capacity" needs clarification. While not solidarily liable, it is unclear what actions can be taken against him personally to satisfy PMPI's obligations.
*   The continued litigation despite PMPI's cessation of operations raises concerns about the potential burden on Brizuela to defend against claims potentially exceeding the remaining assets of the company.

**Note:** The Petition for Certiorari in CA-G.R. SP No. 94005, challenging the NLRC decision itself, remained pending before the CA at the time of the Supreme Court's decision.
