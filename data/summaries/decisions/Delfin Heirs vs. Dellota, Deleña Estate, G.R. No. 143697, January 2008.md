## Legal Document Summary: *Dionisio Dorado Vda. de Delfin v. Salvador D. Dellota* (G.R. No. 143697)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the trial court's judgment on a dispute over land ownership and redemption rights.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Lot No. 1213 in Panitan, Capiz, originally owned by Dionisia Dorado Delfin.
*   **Transactions:**
    *   1929: *Pacto de Retro* sale of 50,000 sq. meters to Spouses Dellota (redemption right not exercised by Dionisia).
    *   1949: *Deed of Sale with Right of Redemption* for 50,000 sq. meters to Gumersindo Deleña for P5,300. Dionisia did not redeem.
    *   1956: *Deed of Mortgage and Promise to Sell* to Salvador Dellota covering 90,000 sq. meters (unclear if it includes the Deleña portion).
*   **Prior Litigation (Civil Case No. V-2760):** Filed by Dionisia in 1964 for recovery of possession and damages. Gumersindo intervened.
*   **Trial Court Decision:**
    *   Ordered Genoveva Dellota to allow redemption of 40,000 sq. meters upon payment of P2,000.
    *   Declared ownership of the 50,000 sq. meters consolidated in favor of Gumersindo Deleña's estate.

**Petitioner's Argument (Dionisia's Heirs):**

*   The 1949 *Deed of Sale with Right of Redemption* is an *equitable mortgage* under Article 1602 of the Civil Code due to the unusually inadequate price. They cite *Santos v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 83664).

**Court's Ruling:**

*   Denied the petition and affirmed the Court of Appeals decision.
*   Found no compelling reason to conclude the P5,300 price in 1949 was unreasonable or unusually inadequate.
*   Cited *Aguilar v. Ribato and Gonzales Vila* (40 Phil. 570), *De Ocampo and Custodio v. Lim* (38 Phil. 579), and *Buenaventura v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 126376) regarding the determination of inadequacy of price in *pacto de retro* sales.
*   Held that tax receipts are not conclusive evidence of ownership.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Article 1602:** Presumption of equitable mortgage in cases of sale with right to repurchase with inadequate price, etc.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 131, Section 3(d):** Presumption that a person takes ordinary care of his concerns.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguous Description in 1956 Mortgage:** The lack of specificity in the 1956 mortgage regarding whether it includes the 50,000 sq. meters sold to Deleña could lead to future disputes.
*   **Reliance on Subjective Determination of Inadequacy:** The determination of "unusually inadequate" price is inherently subjective and may be challenged based on historical economic data.
*   **Potential for Future Claims on Remaining Land:** The heirs of Dionisia may attempt to assert claims on the remaining portion of Lot 1213 based on other legal theories or factual developments.

**Case Law:**

*   **Santos v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 83664):** Cited by the petitioner regarding equitable mortgages.
*   **Aguilar v. Ribato and Gonzales Vila (40 Phil. 570):** Defined gross inadequacy in price.
*   **De Ocampo and Custodio v. Lim (38 Phil. 579):** Price in *pacto de retro* sales not generally considered just value.
*   **Buenaventura v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 126376):** No requirement for sale price to equal exact value.

**Liability and Obligations:**

*   The heirs of Dionisia are liable for the costs of the suit.
*   The heirs of Dellota are obligated to allow redemption of the 40,000 square meter portion upon payment of P2,000.
*   The Intestate Estate of Gumersindo Deleña has consolidated ownership of the 50,000 sq. meter portion.
