## Legal Document Summary: *Sanitary Steam Laundry, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 119092)

**Nature:** Petition for review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court decision holding Sanitary Steam Laundry, Inc. (SSLI) liable for damages resulting from a vehicular collision.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Facts:** SSLI's panel truck collided with a Cimarron, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries. The RTC and CA found SSLI's driver negligent.
*   **Negligence:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the finding of negligence on the part of SSLI's driver based on evidence of losing control and swerving into the opposite lane. The SC found that the driver operated the panel truck at a speed higher than what is prescribed by law, which contributed to the accident.
*   **Contributory Negligence:** SSLI argued contributory negligence by the Cimarron driver (overloading, one headlight, overcrowding) under Art. 2185 of the Civil Code (presumption of negligence for traffic violations). The SC rejected this argument, stating SSLI failed to prove the causal link between the violations and the collision.
*   **Last Clear Chance:** SSLI invoked the doctrine of last clear chance, arguing the Cimarron driver could have avoided the accident. The SC rejected this citing lack of evidence that the driver could have avoided the collision.
*   **Employer Liability:** SSLI argued due diligence in selection/supervision. The SC emphasized the higher standard of care required of employers of drivers, finding SSLI failed to prove due diligence due to lack of physical/psychological testing and inadequate supervision.
*   **Damages:**
    *   **Actual:** Affirmed, based on receipts.
    *   **Moral:** Affirmed as reasonable.
    *   **Death Indemnity:** Affirmed P50,000 to heirs of Jason Bernabe.
    *   **Loss of Earning Capacity (Dalmacio Salunoy):** Modified. Initial award of P100,000 was vacated. SC applied the formula for life expectancy (2/3 * (80 - age)) and net earning capacity, awarding P124,300.00 for loss of earning capacity and P50,000.00 for death indemnity.
    *   **Attorney's Fees:** Disallowed due to lack of factual and legal basis in the lower court's decision (citing *Salao v. Court of Appeals*).

**Obligations:**

*   SSLI is obligated to pay actual damages, moral damages, death indemnity, and loss of earning capacity as modified by the SC.

**Liabilities:**

*   SSLI is directly liable for the damages caused by its driver's negligence, based on the principle of *respondeat superior*.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Solidary Liability (not explicitly mentioned but implied):** While not explicitly stated, SSLI's liability as an employer for the negligent acts of its employee is generally solidary under Philippine law.
*   **Increased Scrutiny:** This case sets a precedent for stricter employer liability in vehicular accidents involving employees, potentially leading to increased scrutiny of hiring and supervision practices.

Court of Appeals, 31 SCRA 511 (1970):* These cases were cited on how to compute the life expectancy of the deceased person and the gross annual income of the deceased person in cases of loss of earning capacity.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Explicit Discussion of Solidary Liability:** The decision doesn't explicitly state whether SSLI's liability is solidary with its driver. While the law implies solidary liability, this could be a point of contention.
