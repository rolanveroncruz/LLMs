## Legal Document Summary - People v. Cirbeto

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Crisanto Cirbeto y Giray*, G.R. No. 231359, February 7, 2018 (825 Phil. 793). Affirms with modification the CA decision convicting Cirbeto of Murder.

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of a conviction for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Facts:**
*   Accused-appellant Crisanto Cirbeto stabbed Ferdinand Casipit to death on December 31, 2010.
*   Eyewitness Roger Dalimoos saw Cirbeto stab Casipit.
*   Cirbeto was apprehended by police officers PO1 Jayson Rael and P/Sr. Insp. Fabian Ribad and the murder weapon recovered.
*   Medico-legal evidence confirmed five stab wounds, the most fatal to the neck.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**
*   **Article 248, RPC (Murder):** Defines and penalizes murder. Requires proof of: (1) death of a person, (2) accused caused the death, (3) killing was attended by a qualifying circumstance (treachery, evident premeditation etc.) and (4) the killing is not parricide or infanticide.
*   **Elements of Treachery:** (1) At the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and (2) the accused consciously and deliberately adopted the particular means, methods, or forms of attack employed by him. *People v. Las Piñas, 739 Phil. 502, 524-525 (2014).*
*   **Elements of Evident Premeditation:** (a) the time when the offender determined to commit the crime; (b) an act manifestly indicating that the culprit has clung to his determination; and (c) a sufficient lapse of time between the determination and execution. *People v. Racal, G.R. No. 224886, September 4,2017*

**Liabilities & Penalties:**
*   **Conviction for Murder:** Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Monetary Awards to Heirs of the Victim:**
    *   Actual Damages: P13,000.00
    *   Civil Indemnity: P75,000.00
    *   Moral Damages: P75,000.00
    *   Exemplary Damages: P75,000.00 (Increased from P30,000.00 by SC)
    *   Interest: 6% per annum on all monetary awards from date of finality of judgment until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**
*   **Defense of Denial/Alibi:** Successfully rebutted by positive identification by eyewitness Dalimoos. Alibi further failed because accused was in the general vicinity.
*   **Evident Premeditation:**  The Supreme Court disagreed with the lower courts on the finding of evident premeditation, however, the conviction of murder was sustained because treachery was proven.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **RPC Article 248:** Definition of Murder.
*   **People v. Las Piñas, 739 Phil. 502 (2014):** Elements of Murder.
*   **People v. Zeta, 573 Phil. 125 (2008):** Testimony of a single credible witness can sustain a murder conviction.
*   **People v. Dayaday, G.R. No. 213224, January 16, 2017:** Weight and Credence of a witness is a matter for the trial court.
*   **People v. Racal, G.R. No. 224886, September 4,2017:** Elements of Evident Premeditation.
*   **People v. Jugueta, G.R. No. 202124, April 5, 2016, 788 SCRA 331:** Jurisprudence on the amount of exemplary damages

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**
*   The primary contention was regarding the identification of the accused. The Supreme Court found the eyewitness testimony to be credible and positive. The initial finding of "evident premeditation" by the lower courts was reversed for lack of sufficient proof.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for Murder, finding treachery was present. The penalty of Reclusion Perpetua was upheld. The monetary awards were affirmed, with an increase in the amount of exemplary damages. The accused's defenses of denial and alibi were rejected.
