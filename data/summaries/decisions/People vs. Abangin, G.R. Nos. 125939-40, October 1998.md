## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Abangin*, G.R. Nos. 125939-40 (1998)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision finding Mario Abangin guilty of two counts of statutory rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   Accused Mario Abangin was found guilty of two counts of statutory rape committed against Shirley Sacbayana, an 11-year-old girl, on May 30, 1993, and June 5, 1993. The Court found the evidence sufficient to convict him based on the testimony of Shirley Sacbayana and the medical examination confirming the presence of a ruptured hymen.
*   The accused was initially sentenced to reclusion perpetua for each count and ordered to pay P50,000 in moral damages per count.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and increased the penalty to include indemnity of P50,000 per count, in addition to the moral damages of P50,000 per count. Therefore, the accused is liable for reclusion perpetua for each count and a total of P100,000 per count (P50,000 in moral damages and P50,000 as indemnity).

**Potential Risks:**

*   The prosecution successfully countered the defense of denial and alibi with positive identification by the victim.
*   Accused's attempt to implicate the victim's grandfather was considered a fabricated attempt at obscuring the truth.
*   The Court's reliance on the trial court's assessment of the victim's credibility is a significant risk for the defense.
*   Appellate court strongly defers to the trial court's assessment of credibility, absent any clear misapplication of facts or arbitrary action.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **Article 2219, in relation to Article 2217 of the Civil Code:** Basis for awarding moral damages.
*   The decision cites several cases regarding credibility of witnesses in rape cases, the weight given to victim testimony, and the weakness of alibi as a defense when the accused has been positively identified by the victim. *People v. Excija*, 258 SCRA 424, 438-439 [1996]; *People v. De Guzman*, 265 SCRA 228, 241 [1996]; *People v. Antido*, 278 SCRA 425, 440 [1997]; *People v. Abrecinoz*, G.R No. 122474-6, 17 October 1997, at 10; *People v. Auxtero*, G.R. No. 118314, 15 April 1998, at 6.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The defense argued inconsistencies in the victim's testimony regarding the time of the incident, disclosure, and dates of medical visits. However, the court dismissed these as minor inconsistencies that enhanced, not detracted from, her credibility. This is contentious as precise details are crucial in criminal trials.
* The assertion that "once a woman cries rape, she is saying all that is necessary to show that rape was indeed committed" (from *People v. Tismo*) can be viewed as problematic.
