Okay, here's a concise legal summary of *Heirs of Josefina Gabriel v. Secundina Cebrero, et al.*, G.R. No. 222737, November 12, 2018:

**Case Summary:**

This is a petition for review on certiorari of a CA decision reversing the RTC's ruling that declared a Deed of Absolute Sale and TCT null and void. The Supreme Court (SC) *denied* the petition and dismissed the underlying complaint without prejudice due to jurisdictional defects arising from improper verification and certification against forum shopping.  While the SC agreed with the RTC’s initial assessment that the buyer of the property (Progressive) was not a buyer in good faith, given that they had constructive notice of the mortgage lien, this became moot due to the lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgage (REM):** Cebrero executed a REM in favor of Gabriel for P8,000,000 secured by a property covered by TCT No. 158305, pursuant to an amicable settlement in a prior annulment case. Cebrero defaulted.
*   **Foreclosure:** Gabriel foreclosed the REM (Civil Case No. 92-62638, RTC Manila Br. 23). The RTC ruled in Gabriel's favor, ordering Cebrero to pay the debt, failing which, the mortgaged property would be sold at public auction. The Sheriff’s Final Deed of Sale was issued to Gabriel as the highest bidder, but not registered.
*   **Sale to Progressive:**  Cebrero, through an attorney-in-fact (Laviña), sold the *entire* property to Progressive Trade & Services Enterprises (Chua) via a Deed of Absolute Sale *after* the foreclosure decision, but prior to the expiration of the redemption period. This sale precipitated the nullity action.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** The core issue is whether the RTC acquired jurisdiction over the nullity action. SC held that it did *not*.
*   **Defective Verification/Certification:** Eduardo Cañiza, purportedly acting as Gabriel's attorney-in-fact, signed the verification and certification against forum shopping in the initial complaint. Crucially, *no Special Power of Attorney (SPA)* was attached to the complaint to demonstrate Cañiza's authority at the time of filing. The SC cited Sec 5, Rule 7 of Rules of Court.
*   **Impact of Substitution:** While Gabriel's heirs later substituted her in the case after her death, this *did not* cure the initial jurisdictional defect arising from the unauthorized filing of the complaint.
*   **Buyer in Bad Faith (moot point):** The RTC had found Chua's Progressive Trade & Services Enterprises to be a buyer in bad faith because the prior mortgage was annotated on the title. While the Supreme Court agreed with the RTC on this point, it was a moot consideration because the original complaint was determined to be invalid.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 3, Section 2 (Parties in Interest):**  Discussed in the context of whether Gabriel, as foreclosure purchaser, was the real party in interest.
*   **Rule 7, Section 5 (Certification Against Forum Shopping):** The central statutory provision at issue.  Emphasizes that the "plaintiff or principal party" must execute the certification.
*   **Rule 41 Section 1** Defines interlocutory orders and final judgements; specifically, it defines when orders are subject to appeal.
*   *Altres, et al. v. Empleo, et al.*, 594 Phil. 246 (2008): Sets out guidelines regarding compliance with verification and certification requirements.
*   *Palmiano-Salvador v. Rosales*, 694 Phil. 1, 6 (2012): Established precedent that without a valid complaint, the court does not acquire jurisdiction.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Authority of Attorney-in-Fact:** The primary contention revolved around whether Cañiza had the proper authorization (SPA) *at the time of the complaint's filing* to act on Gabriel's behalf. His later inclusion as an heir was insufficient.
*   **Impact of Constructive Notice:** While the SC acknowledged that Progressive had constructive notice of the mortgage, this was rendered irrelevant due to the jurisdictional issue.

**Potential Actions/Next Steps:**

*   **Re-filing the Complaint:** The dismissal was *without prejudice*.  Gabriel's heirs could potentially re-file the action, *provided* they can establish a valid basis for doing so and meet all jurisdictional requirements (proper verification/certification, etc.).

I hope this is helpful.
