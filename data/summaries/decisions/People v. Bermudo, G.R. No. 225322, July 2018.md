**Case Summary: *People v. Bermudo*, G.R. No. 225322 (2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Rommel Bermudo y Capistrano for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 248, RPC (Murder):** Defines murder and prescribes the penalty.
*   **Article 8, RPC (Conspiracy):** Defines conspiracy as an agreement between two or more persons to commit a felony.
*   **Article 14(16), RPC (Treachery/Alevosia):** Defines treachery as the employment of means, methods, or forms ensuring the execution of a crime against a person without risk to the offender from the victim's defense.

**Facts:** Rommel Bermudo, along with co-accused Ronelo and Rolando Bermudo, were charged with the murder of Gilberto Bedrero. Rommel was found guilty by the RTC, a decision affirmed by the CA. The prosecution's evidence showed Rommel struck the victim on the head with an ax, and Ronelo and Rolando continued the assault with a bolo and a piece of wood. The defense presented an alibi, claiming Rommel was merely passing by the crime scene.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Rommel Bermudo: Found liable for Murder and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*. Jointly and severally liable with co-accused for civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses to the heirs of Gilberto Bedrero.

**Key Issues & Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Court upheld the lower courts' assessment of the prosecution witnesses (Philip and Grace Bedrero) as credible, despite their relationship to the victim and claims of intoxication by one witness. Cites *People v. Guillera*, 601 Phil. 155 (2009), regarding the reliability of testimonies made by witnesses. Also, intoxication must greatly impair one's faculties in order to deem one unreliable.
*   **Treachery:** The Court found that the killing was committed with treachery. The victim was defenseless when Rommel struck him from behind, and the coordinated attack ensured he could not defend himself.
*   **Conspiracy:** The Court found that Rommel acted in conspiracy with his co-accused, given their coordinated actions and common purpose to kill the victim, citing *People v. de Leon*, 608 Phil. 701 (2009). The coordinated actions of the accused showed a clear unity of purpose. Even without direct evidence of who inflicted the mortal blow, they are all guilty due to conspiracy.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The conviction relies heavily on eyewitness testimonies regarding the sequence of events.
*   **Intoxication of Witness:** The defense argued that one of the witnesses, Philip, was intoxicated, potentially affecting his reliability. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that even if Philip was drunk during the incident, the state of intoxication did not render his testimony as being entirely unreliable.
*   **Cause of Death:** The defense pointed to a discrepancy between the eyewitness accounts and the medical report regarding the cause of death (manual strangulation vs. stab wound), however the court stated that the cause of death was asphyxiation through manual strangulation OR the effect of the stab wound.
*   **Damages:** The amounts awarded as civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages have been updated to reflect current jurisprudence, specifically *People v. Jugueta*, 783 Phil. 806 (2016).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for Murder, finding sufficient evidence of treachery and conspiracy. The Court emphasizes the importance of the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, especially in cases involving eyewitness accounts. The only modification was the increase in exemplary damages to align with current jurisprudence.
