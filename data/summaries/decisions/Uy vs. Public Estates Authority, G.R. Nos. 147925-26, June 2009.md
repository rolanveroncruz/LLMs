## Legal Document Summary: *Uy v. Public Estates Authority (PEA)*

This is a petition for review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modifications a Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) decision in a dispute between Elpidio S. Uy (doing business as Edison Development & Construction - EDC) and Public Estates Authority (PEA) regarding a Landscaping and Construction Agreement for the Heritage Park project.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Landscaping Contract:** PEA engaged EDC to perform landscaping works for P355,080,141.15 with a 450-day completion period from Notice to Proceed (received Dec 3, 1996).
*   **Change Order No. 2-LC:** Excluded a 45-square-meter squatter-occupied portion, reducing the project scope.
*   **Article IX & X:** States that PEA shall not be held liable for any change of work undertaken without a written approval of the PEA General Manager.
*   **Article XXII, Section 21.11:** EDC shall shoulder all cost of electricity, maintenance, repairs, replacement of parts, when needed, and all costs of operation of the deepwell/s, and its appurtenant accessories, i.e. generator sets, etc.

**Obligations:**

*   **EDC:** To perform landscaping work within the agreed time frame and in accordance with specifications, shouldering all costs of generator sets per Article XXII, Section 21.11, and any change of work with prior written approval of PEA General Manager as per Article IX & X.
*   **PEA:** To pay for completed work based on progress billings and the contract price, with no obligation to pay for unauthorized changes.

**Liabilities:**

*   The decision found PEA liable for costs associated with delays in work area turnover and scope reduction based on standby equipment cost.

**CIAC Decision:**

*   Awarded Uy P19,604,132.06 (equipment idle time), P2,275,721.00 (manpower idle time), P6,050,165.05 (nursery shade construction), and P605,016.50 (attorney's fees). Interests were also provided for.

**CA Decision:**

*   Initially dismissed both Uy's and PEA's appeals but ultimately affirmed the CIAC decision *in toto*. Also enjoined CIAC Case No. 03-2001 filed by Uy, citing *litis pendentia* and forum shopping.

**Supreme Court Decision:**

*   Partially granted Uy's petition, modifying the CA decision. Affirmed the award for idle manpower and nursery shade construction. Increased the award for equipment rental on standby to P55,680,492.38 to account for delays in work area turnover. Denied claims for increased topsoil hauling costs and water truck mobilization costs due to lack of written approval from the PEA General Manager. Upheld the attorney's fees award at 10% and affirmed the injunction against CIAC Case No. 03-2001.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Written Approval for Changes:** Article IX and X create a significant risk for EDC as it required them to obtain written approval from the PEA General Manager for any additional work to be completed to gain any payment for the work. The court heavily relied on this clause when denying the costs for topsoil and water truck.
*   **Injunctive Relief:** The CA's injunction of CIAC Case No. 03-2001 signals a concern about possible forum shopping by Uy. This could potentially expose Uy to sanctions if similar claims are pursued in other forums.
*   **Determination of Standby Equipment Cost:** Disagreement as to what calculation method must be used to properly award standby equipment cost.
*   ***Litis pendentia* and *res judicata***: The Court considered whether the elements of *litis pendentia* were present. However, the court determined *res judicata* did not apply, as there was no final judgement yet.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1724, Civil Code:** Requires written authorization from the owner for price increases due to changes in plans/specifications.
*   **Articles 1229 & 2227, Civil Code:** Empowers courts to reduce iniquitous penalties.
*   **Rule 43, Revised Rules of Civil Procedure:** Governs appeals from the CIAC.
*   **Association of Carriers and Equipment Lessors (ACEL), Inc.** CIAC used the rate given by the Association of Carriers and Equipment Lessors (ACEL), Inc. as a base.
*   ***Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, et al., 243 SCRA 78 [1994]; Keng Hua Paper Products Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 286 SCRA 257 [1998]; Crismina Garments, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 128721, March 9, 1999).*** Determines appropriate interest rates.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The Landscaping Contract's silence on the amount of attorney's fees to be recovered *from* PEA, leading to judicial discretion in determining a reasonable amount.

This summary provides a concise overview of the legal document, highlighting key provisions, obligations, liabilities, potential risks, and relevant legal precedents. It should be helpful in understanding the core issues and potential ramifications of the *Uy v. PEA* case.
