## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Ragudo, Jr.* G.R. No. 267795 (April 15, 2024)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) judgment finding Jose P. Ragudo, Jr. guilty of murder and theft. The Supreme Court (SC) modified the conviction to homicide and adjusted the theft penalty.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Murder Charge (Crim. Case No. 5036-18):**
    *   **RTC & CA:** Found Ragudo guilty of murder based on treachery and abuse of superior strength.
    *   **SC:** Reduced conviction to **homicide**. The SC found no clear and convincing evidence of treachery or abuse of superior strength as defined in applicable jurisprudence like *People v. Enriquez, Jr.* and *People v. Cortez*. The attack's suddenness, without evidence of deliberate planning, was insufficient to prove treachery. Also found that the evidence must establish that the assailants purposely sought advantage.
    *   **Penalty:** Indeterminate sentence of 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 14 years, 8 months, and 1 day of *reclusion temporal*.
    *   **Damages:** PHP 50,000 civil indemnity, PHP 50,000 moral damages, and PHP 60,000 actual damages (for burial and funeral expenses) awarded to the victim's heirs, with 6% interest per annum from finality.
*   **Theft Charge (Crim. Case No. 5037-18):**
    *   **RTC & CA:** Found Ragudo guilty of simple theft, not qualified theft, as the prosecution failed to prove grave abuse of confidence.
    *   **SC:** Affirmed the conviction for theft.
    *   **Penalty:** Modified to 2 months and 1 day of *arresto mayor*, citing *Viray v. People* regarding the application of the minimum penalty under Article 309 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) when the property's value is not proven. The RTC imposed the penalty of imprisonment of four months which the supreme court deemed incorrect, and imposed the penalty of two months and one day of *arresto mayor*.
*   **Alarms and Scandals (Crim. Case No. 5038-18):** Dismissed by the RTC for lack of jurisdiction. (Not part of this appeal).

**Defense of Insanity:**

*   Ragudo argued he was insane at the time of the offenses, supported by NCMH reports indicating schizophrenia.
*   **SC:** Rejected the insanity defense. Citing *People v. Formigones* and *People v. Paña*, the SC held that Ragudo failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was completely deprived of reason and free will *at the time of the crime.* The NCMH evaluations were performed well after the incident and were based primarily on Ragudo's own narrative, not contemporaneous observations by others. *Paña* further clarifies the need for medical proof of insanity at the time of the commission of the crime.
*   Moreover, he was able to recall what happened on the time he committed the crime. The SC also reiterated the RTC and CA findings in not adhering to the legal conclusion of the NCMH.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Ragudo: Criminal liability for homicide and theft. Obligation to serve the modified prison sentences and pay damages.
*   State: Burden of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt for each element of the crimes charged and the existence of qualifying circumstances.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjective Interpretation of Evidence:** While the SC applied objective tests for treachery and abuse of superior strength, the analysis hinges on interpreting circumstantial evidence and witness testimonies, leaving room for potential disagreement. The SC gave particular weight to the testimony of witnesses Sacbibit and Salvador, for their testimony in the trial court showed that they had a normal conversation with Ragudo before the stabbing and that he was just acting normal and his usual tasks.
*   **Reliance on NCMH Reports:** The SC's rejection of the NCMH's conclusion highlights the ongoing tension between medical and legal definitions of insanity. Future cases involving mental health defenses should carefully scrutinize the timing, methodology, and evidentiary basis of psychiatric evaluations, and make sure that it happened right before and on the day of the commission of the offense.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The SC's application of *People v. Cortez* regarding the requirement of purposely seeking or deliberately intending to use superior strength may be subject to debate. The determination of "purposeful seeking" can be challenging to prove circumstantially.
