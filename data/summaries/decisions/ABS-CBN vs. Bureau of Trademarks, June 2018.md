**Legal Document Summary: ABS-CBN Publishing, Inc. vs. Director of the Bureau of Trademarks (G.R. No. 217916)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' denial of ABS-CBN Publishing, Inc.'s (Petitioner) motion for extension to file a petition for review and the subsequent affirmation of that denial.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the petition due to late filing, and whether the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) correctly refused trademark registration due to confusing similarity with existing marks.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' dismissal.

**Key Provisions, Obligations, and Liabilities:**

*   **Section 123.1(d) of the Intellectual Property Code (IPC):** Prohibits registration of a mark identical or confusingly similar to a registered mark for identical or related goods/services.  This is the statutory basis for the IPO's denial of registration.
*   **Rule 43, Section 4, Rules of Court:** Sets the 15-day period to appeal from the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) decisions to the Court of Appeals. Failure to comply renders the IPO decision final and executory.
*   **Obligation to Perfect Appeal:** Litigants bear the burden to perfect appeals within the prescribed periods. Failure is jurisdictional.
*   **Liability for Late Filing:** The Petitioner's failure to timely file due to counsel's workload and conference attendance was deemed inexcusable negligence.
*   **Abandonment:** The Petitioner's prior application was "deemed abandoned," forfeiting any rights stemming from prior use under the old Trademark Law (RA 166).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Permanent Loss of Trademark Protection:**  The decision solidifies the denial of trademark registration, potentially preventing the Petitioner from exclusively using the "METRO" mark for magazines, absent refiling and a successful application.
*   **Infringement Liability:** Continued use of the "METRO" mark without registration could expose the Petitioner to infringement claims by the owners of the existing registered "METRO" marks.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Intellectual Property Code (RA 8293), Section 123.1(d):**  The core statutory provision cited for the denial of trademark registration.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 43, Section 4:** Sets the timeframe for appeals to the CA.

*   **Birkenstock Orthopaedie GMBH and Co. KG. vs. Philippine Shoe Expo Marketing Corporation (721 Phil. 867 (2013)):** Highlights the consequences of failing to file a declaration of actual use.
*   **Mattel, Inc. vs. Francisco (582 Phil. 492, 499 (2008)):** Reinforces the non-filing of declarations of actual use.
*   **Rules of Procedure for Intellectual Property Cases (A.M. No. 10-3-10-SC), Section 3, Rule 18:** Presumption of Likelihood of Confusion.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **The potential refiling of the application**: The Court leaves the door open for the applicant, however, it does not guarantee it will be approved.
*   **Validity of cited marks at the time of Supreme Court ruling**:  The Petitioner's claims of invalidity due to deregistration and cancellation of the cited marks are not directly addressed due to procedural issues (not raised at the time of initial appeal). The court ruled that it could not make the determination as the court is not the Trier of Facts.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the denial of trademark registration based on (1) procedural lapse (late filing of the appeal) and (2) substantive grounds (confusing similarity with existing registered marks). While refiling is possible, success hinges on the status of the cited marks and a new determination by the IPO. The applicant's abandonment of the earlier trademark application was extremely detrimental.
