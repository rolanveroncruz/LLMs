**Summary of *Emilia Mari√±as vs. Terencio G. Florendo* (A.M. No. P-07-2304)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary administrative matter against Sheriff Florendo for neglect of duty in implementing a writ of execution.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Neglect of Duty (Rule 39, Section 14):** Florendo failed to execute the writ of execution in Civil Case No. 5238-V for approximately three years after its issuance. He also failed to submit required 30-day reports to the court detailing efforts to satisfy the judgment, violating Rule 39, Section 14 of the Rules of Court. *Garcia v. Yared* supports the duty to report.
*   **Improper Receipt of Funds (Rule 141, Section 10):** Florendo admitted receiving P1,000 from the complainant for expenses without prior court approval and deposit with the Clerk of Court, violating Rule 141, Section 10. *Danao vs. Franco, Jr.* and *Commendador vs. Canabe* are cited to support the prohibition against receiving payments without court approval.
*   **Delegation of Duty:** The Court held Florendo responsible for implementation even though the writ was endorsed to another jurisdiction (Dagupan City). He should have sought assistance from the local sheriff, but remained ultimately responsible for the execution.
*   **Circumvention of Rules:** The Court emphasized that even if the money was used for legitimate purposes, acceptance without following procedure outlined in Rule 141 constitutes misconduct. *Villarico v. Javier* and *Tan v. Dela Cruz* are used to support the unlawful exaction due to the breach of Rule 141.

**Obligations:**

*   Sheriffs have a duty to diligently execute writs of execution without delay.
*   Sheriffs must adhere strictly to Rule 39, Section 14, and submit timely reports.
*   Sheriffs must adhere strictly to Rule 141, Section 10 and properly handle funds related to execution.
*   Sheriffs have a duty to know and comply with rules of execution.

**Liabilities:**

*   Sheriff Florendo was found guilty of neglect of duty and was fined an amount equivalent to one month's salary.
*   Sheriff Florendo was ordered to immediately implement the subject writ.
*   The case sets precedent for holding sheriffs accountable for both procedural (reports) and financial (handling of funds) violations.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Enforcement Challenges:** While Florendo is ordered to implement the writ, the difficulty in locating assets or debtors remains a practical obstacle.
*   **Subjectivity in "Immediate" Implementation:** The definition of "immediately implement" may be subject to interpretation.
*   **Application of Fine vs. Suspension:** Court replaced suspension with fine to allow defendant to perform his obligations without further delay.
*   **Lack of Clarity on Specific Expenses:** The documents does not explicitly indicate what the expenses should be, although the complainant did give money to the defendant for operational purposes.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 14 (Rules of Court):** Return of Writ of Execution.
*   **Rule 141, Section 10 (Rules of Court):** Sheriff's Fees and Expenses.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 12 (Oct 1, 1985):** Guidelines in the Service and Execution of Court Writs.
*   ***Garcia v. Yared* (A.M. No. P-01-1492):** Duty to report.
*   **Danao vs. Franco, Jr. (440 Phil. 181, 185-186 (2002); Commendador vs. Canabe, 438 Phil. 99, 107 (2002).** Improper receipt of funds without court approval.
*   **Villarico v. Javier, A.M. No. P-04-1828, February 14, 2005, 451 SCRA 218, 223-224; Tan v. Dela Cruz, A.M. No. P-04-1892, September 30, 2004, 439 SCRA 555, 562.** Unlawful exaction due to breach of Rule 141

**Conclusion:**

The case underscores the critical importance of sheriffs adhering to both the procedural requirements for reporting on execution efforts and the financial protocols for handling funds related to those efforts. The failure to do so can result in disciplinary action, emphasizing the high standards of conduct expected of officers of the court.
