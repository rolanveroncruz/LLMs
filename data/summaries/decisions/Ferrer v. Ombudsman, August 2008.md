## Legal Document Summary: *Col. Arturo C. Ferrer (Ret.) v. Hon. Office of the Ombudsman, et al.* G.R. No. 129036 (2008)

**Nature of the Document:**  Supreme Court decision on a petition for review on certiorari, affirming the Ombudsman's dismissal of a complaint filed by Col. Ferrer alleging violations of Section 3(e) and (g) of R.A. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) by NFA officials.

**Key Provisions and Allegations:**

*   **Complaint:** Ferrer alleged that NFA officials (David, Gerochi, Cordoba, et al.) caused undue injury and gave unwarranted benefits to Metroguard and DASIA by awarding them security service contracts despite alleged collusion and pending appeal of an RTC decision.
*   **Ombudsman's Dismissal:** The Ombudsman dismissed the complaint, relying on a similar case (OMB-0-96-1552) filed by another complainant involving the same bidding process, issues, and respondents. The dismissal was based on the RTC Davao ruling that there was no collusion and the NFA was directed to proceed with the award.
*   **Petitioner's Arguments:**  Ferrer argued that:
    *   The Ombudsman improperly relied on the other case without independently evaluating his complaint (denial of due process).
    *   Awarding contracts while the RTC decision was under appeal and despite OGCC opinions of collusion was improper.
    *   The Ombudsman has jurisdiction to investigate violations of the Private Security Agency Law (R.A. 5487) to determine criminal liability.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **NFA Officials:**  Obligated to conduct fair and competitive bidding processes, and avoid actions that violate R.A. 3019.  Potential liability for causing undue injury to any party or giving unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference.
*   **Office of the Ombudsman:** Obligated to investigate complaints against public officials for violations of anti-graft laws.  Discretionary power to dismiss complaints for lack of merit.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **"Collusion" Definition:**  The central issue hinges on whether the relationship between Metroguard and DASIA constituted actionable "collusion." The OGCC opinions suggested collusion based on identical bids and sister agency relationships, but the RTC Davao ruling found otherwise. This ambiguity led to conflicting interpretations and ultimately the Ombudsman's dismissal.
*   **Pendency of Appeal:**  The award of the contracts while the RTC decision was under appeal is a point of contention.  The Court addresses this by noting the RTC decision had not been reversed at the time the Ombudsman reviewed Ferrer's complaint, and, as such, remained controlling.
*   **Reliance on Other Case:**  While the Ombudsman is permitted to dismiss a case for lack of merit, the extent to which they can rely on the resolution of another case, especially one with similar issues, is subject to due process challenges.  The Court found no violation in this instance, as the Ombudsman carefully studied Ferrer's complaint.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Section 3(e) (causing undue injury or giving unwarranted benefits) and Section 3(g) (entering into grossly disadvantageous contracts).
*   **R.A. 5487 (Private Security Agency Law):**  Discussed in relation to the Ombudsman's jurisdiction, highlighting that PNP has supervision over security agencies.
*   **R.A. 1379:**  Act Declaring Forfeiture in Favor of the State Any Property Found to Have Been Unlawfully Acquired by any Public Officer or Employee and Providing for the Proceedings Therefor.
*   **R.A. 6713:** Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.
*   **R.A. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989):**  Discussed in relation to the Office of the Ombudsman's investigative and prosecutorial powers, and its discretion to determine whether a criminal case should be filed.
*   **Administrative Order No. 07 (Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman):**  Rule II, Section 2 outlines the evaluation process and grounds for dismissal.
*   *National Food Authority v. Court of Appeals* G.R. Nos. 115121-25 (1996): Declared NFA negotiated contracts void, which partially prompted this bidding and eventual award of the contracts.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Ombudsman's dismissal, emphasizing the Ombudsman's discretionary power and finding no grave abuse of discretion. The decision highlights the complexities of defining collusion in bidding processes and the deference given to existing court rulings pending appeal. It also clarifies the jurisdictional boundaries between the Ombudsman and other agencies in investigating related violations, such as those under the Private Security Agency Law. The dismissal turned on the Ombudsman's appreciation of the fact that the Davao RTC had ruled on the allegations and the award was done under order from the Court of Appeals.
