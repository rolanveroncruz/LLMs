## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Sanchez y Licudine* (G.R. No. 231383)

**Nature:** Supreme Court Decision reversing the CA's affirmance of the RTC's conviction of the accused for violation of Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession) of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 9165, Sections 5 & 11:** Defines and penalizes illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs, respectively.
*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 (Pre-RA 10640 Amendment):** Outlines the procedure for handling seized drugs, including:
    *   Immediate physical inventory and photography at the place of seizure.
    *   Presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official during the inventory and photography. All must sign the inventory.
    *   Turnover of seized drugs to the PNP Crime Laboratory within 24 hours.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Establishes the requirement to maintain an unbroken chain of custody to ensure the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs as the corpus delicti.

**Liabilities & Penalties (If Conviction Upheld):**

*   Life imprisonment and fines for illegal sale (Section 5).
*   Imprisonment (12 years and 1 day to 20 years) and fines for illegal possession (Section 11).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Breach of Chain of Custody:** The Supreme Court found the buy-bust team committed unjustified deviations from the chain of custody rule, specifically in their failure to ensure representatives from the DOJ and the media were present during the actual conduct of the inventory. Further, NO ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICIAL was present at the time. While representatives were present at the office to sign the inventory, this did not satisfy the requirements of law.
*   **Witness Requirement:** The prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds or show special circumstances excusing the lack of elected public officials, and to show that earnest efforts were made to contact these parties. The reason given for their non-compliance was a “rush operation.”
*   **Impact on Evidence:** These procedural failures compromised the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs, leading to the accused's acquittal.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Sections 5 and 11, Article II** defines the crimes of Illegal sale and illegal possession of drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21, Article II (prior to RA 10640 amendment)** dictates chain of custody procedures.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014)**: Emphasizes the importance of the presence of the representative from the media or the [DOJ], or any elected public official during the seizure and marking of the [seized drugs].
*   **People v. Almorfe, 631 Phil. 51 (2010)**: Established the requirement to explain reasons behind procedural lapses and demonstrate preserved integrity and evidentiary value of seized evidence for the "saving clause" to apply.
*   **People v. De Guzman, 630 Phil. 637 (2010)**: Justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, and cannot be presumed.
*   **People v. Umipang, 686 Phil. 1024, 1052 (2012)**: Discussed the importance of earnest efforts being employed to contact the representatives enumerated under the law.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "saving clause" in Section 21(a) of the IRR of RA 9165, allowing for non-strict compliance under justifiable grounds, is often subject to interpretation and litigation. The court has clarified that justifiable grounds must be proven, not merely asserted.

**Conclusion:**

The *People v. Sanchez y Licudine* case highlights the crucial importance of strict adherence to the chain of custody rule in drug cases. Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165, absent justifiable explanation and proof of preserved integrity of the evidence, will likely result in the acquittal of the accused. This case serves as a cautionary tale for law enforcement regarding proper procedures in drug-related arrests and evidence handling.
