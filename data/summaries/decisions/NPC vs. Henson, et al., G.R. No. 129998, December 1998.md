**Case Summary: National Power Corporation v. Henson, et al., G.R. No. 129998 (1998)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal via certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming with modification a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision in an eminent domain case filed by the National Power Corporation (NPC) against landowners (Henson et al.) for the expansion of the NPC Mexico Sub-Station.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Eminent Domain:** NPC sought to expropriate five (5) parcels of land, totaling 58,311 sq. meters, in Mexico, Pampanga. Lands were originally agricultural land and covered by OLT, but re-classified as residential.
*   **Procedural History:** NPC filed the complaint, landowners filed a motion to dismiss questioning just compensation but not NPC's right to condemn the land. The RTC denied the motion to dismiss, fixed a provisional value, and issued a writ of possession after NPC deposited the amount. Landowners withdrew the deposit. Commissioners were appointed to determine just compensation. RTC set just compensation at P400/sq. meter plus interest. CA affirmed, except for attorney's fees.
*   **Key Issue:** The primary issue is the determination of just compensation for the expropriated land.
*   **RTC Valuation:** The RTC determined just compensation to be P400.00/sq. meter, based on the selling price of lots in an adjacent, fully developed subdivision, Santo Domingo Village Subdivision. This was higher than any of the commissioner's reports.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC's decision except for deletion of attorney's fees of 20,000.00.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Modified the CA decision. The Court determined the proper valuation to be P375.00/sq. meter, based on Commissioner Atienzaâ€™s report, as the land was undeveloped and primarily agricultural (raw land), despite reclassification. The Court also ruled that a communal irrigation canal of 4,809 sq. meters should be excluded from the expropriated area, as per the amended complaint.
*   **Interest:** Legal interest was correctly awarded from the date NPC took possession (September 11, 1990), less amounts already withdrawn by landowners, at 6% per annum until finality and 12% thereafter until fully paid.

**Obligations:**

*   **NPC:** Obligated to pay just compensation of P375.00/sq. meter for 58,311 sq. meters of land, plus legal interest as specified.

**Liabilities:**

*   **NPC:** Liable for just compensation and interest from the date of taking.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation Dispute:** The valuation of just compensation remains contentious. The Supreme Court overturned the findings of both the RTC and CA, reducing the awarded amount based on their interpretation of the commissioner's reports.
*   **Area Discrepancy:** Discrepancy in the area being taken (original complaint vs. amended complaint) created issues regarding the inclusion of the irrigation canal.
*   **Land Classification:** Even though the land was re-classified as residential, its agricultural character still influenced its valuation, leading to a lower compensation than the landowners may have anticipated based on the proximity of the fully developed subdivision.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Revised Rules of Court:** Governs appeals via certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Rule 67, Revised Rules of Court (Eminent Domain):** Sets out the procedure for expropriation.
*   **Republic vs. PNB, 1 SCRA 957; Republic vs. Juan, 92 SCRA 26:**  Establishes the principle that the nature and character of the land at the time of taking is the principal criterion in determining just compensation.
*   **Tio Khe Chio vs. Court of Appeals, 202 SCRA 119:** Pertains to the rate of legal interest.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The value assigned by the trial court was even higher than the recommended value made by any of the commissioners, which was found by the Supreme Court as having no support in the evidence.

**Legal Precision:**

*   The summary specifies the amounts, areas, and legal interest rates as determined by the Supreme Court. It cites relevant Rules of Court and jurisprudence relevant to eminent domain and just compensation.
