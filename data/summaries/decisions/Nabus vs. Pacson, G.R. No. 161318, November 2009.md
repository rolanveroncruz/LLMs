## Legal Document Summary: *Nabus v. Pacson*, G.R. No. 161318

This case concerns a dispute over land ownership arising from a "Deed of Conditional Sale" (DCS) executed in 1977 between the Nabus spouses (vendors) and the Pacson spouses (vendees). The Supreme Court (SC) reverses the Court of Appeals (CA) and Regional Trial Court (RTC) decisions, ultimately ruling in favor of Betty Tolero, a subsequent purchaser of the property.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Nature of Contract:** The SC recharacterizes the DCS as a **contract to sell**, not a contract of sale. This is crucial because in a contract to sell, ownership remains with the vendor until full payment of the purchase price (citing *Coronel v. CA*, 331 Phil. 294 (1996) and *Chua v. CA*, 449 Phil. 25 (2003)).
*   **Suspensive Condition:** Full payment of the purchase price is a positive suspensive condition. Failure to fulfill this condition does *not* constitute a breach of contract, but rather prevents the vendor's obligation to convey title from arising (citing *Heirs of Pedro Escanlar v. CA*, G.R. No. 119777).
*   **Validity of Subsequent Sale:** Because the Pacsons failed to fully pay the agreed-upon price, the Nabus spouses were within their rights to sell the property to Betty Tolero. Tolero thus acquired valid title, and the new transfer certificates of title (TCTs) in her name are deemed valid.
*   **Reimbursement & Nominal Damages:** While the Pacsons lose the property, the Nabus spouses are ordered to reimburse the Pacsons for all payments made towards the purchase price (P112,455.16) with 12% annual interest. The Pacsons are also awarded nominal damages of P10,000 to vindicate their violated right (right to execute deed of sale).
*   **No Specific Performance:** Specific performance of the alleged obligation to sell to the Pacsons is unavailable because there was no extant obligation on the part of the vendors to transfer the ownership of the land.

**Obligations:**

*   **Nabus/Tolero:** No obligation to execute a deed of absolute sale in favor of the Pacsons.
*   **Nabus:** Obligated to reimburse Pacsons for payments made.
*   **Pacson:** None beyond receiving the reimbursed payments.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Nabus:** Liable for reimbursement of payments and nominal damages (based on Article 2221 and 2222 of the Civil Code).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **"Buyer in Good Faith" Argument:** The SC implicitly rejects the argument that Tolero's knowledge of the DCS necessarily rendered her a buyer in bad faith. The SC focuses on the fact that the suspensive condition was not met, rather than Tolero's good/bad faith.
*   **Application of Article 1191 (Rescission):** The SC explicitly states that Article 1191 of the Civil Code (rescission of reciprocal obligations) does not apply because the suspensive condition was not met, thus there can be no rescission of an obligation that has not yet come into existence.
* **Applicability of case law**: Some case laws were ruled as inapplicable because they are not breaches of contract.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1458 of the Civil Code:** Definition of a contract of sale.
*   **Article 1191 of the Civil Code:** Rescission of reciprocal obligations (deemed inapplicable).
*   **Article 2221 and 2222 of the Civil Code:** Nominal damages.
*   **Ramos v. Heruela, G.R. No. 145330:** Distinguishes between absolute and conditional sales.
*   **Coronel v. Court of Appeals, 331 Phil. 294:** Distinguishes between contract to sell and contract of sale.
*   **Chua v. Court of Appeals, 449 Phil. 25:** Further distinction between contract to sell and contract of sale.
*  **Heirs of Pedro Escanlar v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 119777**: Non Fulfillment of a Contract of Sale

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The classification of the "Deed of Conditional Sale" itself. The Court looks past the title and examines the specific stipulations.

**Legally Precise Takeaways:**

The *Nabus v. Pacson* case reinforces the importance of clearly defining the nature of a sales agreement. The distinction between a contract of sale and a contract to sell is critical. The decision highlights that in a contract to sell, full payment of the purchase price is a suspensive condition. Failure to meet this condition prevents the obligation to convey title from arising, allowing the seller to validly sell the property to a third party. The original buyer's remedy is limited to reimbursement and potentially nominal damages.
