## Legal Document Summary: *Nasipit Integrated Arrastre and Stevedoring Services, Inc. (NIASSI) v. Nasipit Employees Labor Union (NELU)-ALU-TUCP*

**Case Citation:** 578 Phil. 762 (G.R. No. 162411, June 27, 2008)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review under Rule 45 assailing the CA decision affirming the Voluntary Arbitrator's decision in favor of the Union regarding the implementation of Wage Order No. RXIII-02 (WO RXIII-02).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**
*   **Wage Order RXIII-02:** Issued by the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board (Wage Board) of Caraga Region, granting a PhP 12 per day Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) to *minimum wage earners*.
*   **NIASSI's Position:** Argues that its employees already receive wages above the minimum wage, rendering WO RXIII-02 inapplicable.
*   **Union's Position:** Contends that WO RXIII-02 doesn't explicitly prohibit wage increases for employees earning above the minimum wage. Also invokes Article XIX, Section 2 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
*   **Voluntary Arbitrator's Decision:** Favored the Union, ordering the implementation of WO RXIII-02, reasoning that the wage order didn't prohibit increases for employees earning above the minimum wage and that the CBA prevents NIASSI from crediting these increases against future mandated wage increases.
*   **CBA Provision (Article XIX, Section 2):** Specifies that general wage increases granted by NIASSI one year after signing the CBA are *not* creditable to future legally mandated wage increases.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court **reversed** the CA and Voluntary Arbitrator's decisions, holding that WO RXIII-02 applies *only* to minimum wage earners. The Union's complaint was dismissed.

**Key Legal Reasoning & Case Law:**
*   **Expressio unius est exclusio alterius:** The express mention of minimum wage earners in WO RXIII-02 excludes those earning above the minimum wage from its coverage.
*   **Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, Inc., v. National Wages and Productivity Commission (G.R. No. 144322, February 6, 2007):** The Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board's (RTWPB) mandate is to determine and fix minimum wage rates. An "across-the-board" wage increase affecting all wage levels exceeds this authority. The SC cited this to establish that RTWPB cannot issue orders that aren't about setting minimum wage rates.
*   **Wage Distortion Exception:** Employees above the minimum wage may benefit from the order *only* through correction of wage distortions, as provided by the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR).

**Liabilities & Obligations:**
*   NIASSI is *not* legally obligated to grant wage increases to employees already receiving wages above the minimum wage under WO RXIII-02.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**
*   **Wage Distortion Claims:** Although the main claim was dismissed, individual employees may still pursue claims based on "wage distortion" if the implementation of WO RXIII-02 created inequities in pay scales (see Sec. 1(c) of the IRR).
*   **CBA Interpretation:** The CBA provision on non-creditability of wage increases was deemed inapplicable because coverage of the wage order was the core issue. However, future disputes about crediting may still arise under different circumstances, requiring careful interpretation of Article XIX, Section 2 in light of *Pag-Asa Steel Works, Inc., G.R. No. 166647, March 31, 2006.*

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court clarified that Wage Order No. RXIII-02, which prescribed a COLA, exclusively benefits minimum wage earners in the Caraga Region.  The Court found that extending the benefit to workers already earning above the minimum wage would be an ultra vires act on the part of the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board (RTWPB), exceeding its mandate to set minimum wage levels. The Court also held that the Voluntary Arbitrator erred in resolving doubts in favor of labor and failing to address the core issue of the coverage and application of WO RXIII-02.
