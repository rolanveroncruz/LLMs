This is a summary of the Supreme Court's Resolution in *NPC Drivers and Mechanics Association (NPC DAMA) v. National Power Corporation (NPC)*, G.R. No. 156208, dated September 17, 2008, which addressed the aftermath of the Court's prior decision declaring National Power Board (NPB) Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 void.

**Key Issue:** The Resolution clarifies the implications of the voiding of the NPB Resolutions and addresses the attorney's fees of Petitioners' counsel.

**Prior Ruling:** The Supreme Court previously declared NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 void due to improper delegation of voting power by NPB members, as only three members actually voted during the meeting. These resolutions directed the termination of NPC employees as part of the EPIRA (Republic Act No. 9136) mandated restructuring. *Binamira v. Garrucho* was cited, reinforcing the principle that discretionary powers cannot be delegated.

**Clarifications and Obligations:**

*   **Reorganization:** The Court clarifies that while the termination of employees under the voided Resolutions was illegal, the broader NPC reorganization pursuant to the EPIRA Law and NPB Resolution No. 2002-53 (approving the new organizational structure) was *not* affected. NPC can pursue its reorganization, but must do so legally.
*   **Reinstatement/Separation Pay:** The Petitioners are entitled to reinstatement to their former positions (or equivalent), or separation pay in lieu of reinstatement. This is based on a *validly approved* separation program, as per *Caliguia v. National Labor Relations Commission*.
*   **Backwages:** Petitioners are also entitled to backwages, wage adjustments, and other benefits from January 31, 2003 (date of illegal termination) until reinstatement or payment of separation pay.
*   **Offset:** Any separation benefits already received under the voided resolutions must be deducted from the backwages and separation pay owed.
*   **Operative Fact Doctrine:** The Court applies the "operative fact doctrine," acknowledging the reorganization occurred before the ruling, precluding a complete return to the *status quo ante* (De Agbayani v. Philippine National Bank).

**Attorney's Fees (Charging Lien):**

*   **Entitlement:** Atty. Aldon and Atty. Orocio, the original counsels, are entitled to a charging lien on the amounts recoverable by Petitioners. Their legal retainer agreement stipulated a contingency fee of 25% of the amounts recovered.
*   **Reasonableness:** The Court *reduces* the contingency fee to 10%, citing Section 24, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court (contracts for services unconscionable or unreasonable) and Article 111 of the Labor Code (limiting attorney's fees in illegal dismissal cases to 10%).  The *J.K. Mercado and Sons Agricultural Enterprises, Inc. v. De Vera* case was cited.
*   **Enforcement:** The calculation of amounts due and enforcement is left to the "proper forum" because this Court is not a trier of facts (*Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party v. Commission on Elections*).
*   **Recording:** The charging lien of 10% can be recorded now in the records to establish their right per *Palanca v. Pecson*, giving the lawyers the same right and power to the judgment as their clients as per Rule 137, Section 38.
*   **Judgment Debtor Liability:** NPC is put on notice of the lien and may be held liable for its full value if it satisfies the judgment without accounting for the attorney's fees (*Calalang v. De Borja*).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Computation Disputes:** The actual computation of backwages, separation pay, and the amount to be offset is left to a future proceeding, creating potential for disputes.
*   **Valid Separation Program:**  The Court's directive that separation pay be based on a "validly approved" separation program creates uncertainty.  If no such program exists or is challenged, further litigation is likely.
*   **Enforcement Challenges:**  Enforcing the charging lien against individual Petitioners could be complex, given potential disagreements over the distribution of recovered funds.
*   **Authority Disputes:** The dispute between the Petitioners and Counsels that arose after the first favorable ruling may affect the execution of the charging lien.

**Statutory and Case Law References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 9136 (EPIRA Law)**
*   **Rule 138, Section 24 and 37 of the Rules of Court**
*   **Article 111 of the Labor Code**
*   *Binamira v. Garrucho*
*   *Caliguia v. National Labor Relations Commission*
*   *De Agbayani v. Philippine National Bank*
*   *J.K. Mercado and Sons Agricultural Enterprises, Inc. v. De Vera*
*   *Palanca v. Pecson*
*   *Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party v. Commission on Elections*
*   *Calalang v. De Borja*

**Conclusion:**

The Resolution clarifies the consequences of the earlier invalidation of NPB Resolutions. While providing a pathway for Petitioners to recover lost wages and benefits, it also introduces potential for further litigation related to the valuation of those benefits and the enforcement of attorney's fees. The key takeaway is the emphasis on compliance with valid legal procedures for the reorganization of the NPC and the payment of compensation to its employees.
