**Case Summary: Ver-Reyes v. Court of Appeals, et al. (G.R. No. 153263)**

**Subject Matter:** Petition for review on certiorari regarding the denial of annotation of a Notice of Lis Pendens.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Chain of Title Dispute:** Emma Ver-Reyes (Petitioner) claims ownership based on a 1976 Deed of Absolute Sale from the Cuevas spouses (TCT No. 58459). Irene Montemayor (Respondent) later acquired title via a 1992 Deed from the same spouses (TCT No. 369793).
*   **Reconveyance Suit:** Petitioner sued Respondent for reconveyance, alleging forgery by Respondent, which was dismissed by the RTC.
*   **Respondent's Waiver:** Respondent executed a Waiver and Quitclaim in favor of Engracia Isip, recognizing Isip's title (TCT No. 769357) and admitting her own title was simulated. This led to the cancellation of Respondent's title.
*   **Isip's Title:** Isip's title derives from Bureau of Lands documents dating back to 1954. A new title (TCT No. 769357) was issued to her in 1997, despite a prior chain of conveyances originating from the same original title (OCT No. 1002) and including the Cuevas.
*   **Heirs of Isip & Mortgage:** Isip's heirs obtained TCT No. T-784707 and mortgaged the property.
*   **Refusal of Lis Pendens:** Petitioner sought to annotate a Notice of Lis Pendens on TCT No. T-784707 held by Isip's heirs, which the Register of Deeds refused, and the LRA and CA upheld the refusal.

**Key Obligations:**

*   There is no clear obligation by a registered owner to allow annotation of *lis pendens* unless they are party to the original action
*   Register of deeds has ministerial duty to annotate a *lis pendens* if it meets the statutory requirements

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner risks losing the property due to failure to register the initial sale and failure to properly secure her claim by initially filing a *lis pendens* with the first action.
*   Isip's heirs risk their title being subject to the original lawsuit despite not being parties to it.
*   Potentiano Ponce risks his mortgage being subject to the suit between Petitioner and Respondent

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 13, Section 14:**  Addresses the requirements for a Notice of Lis Pendens.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 76:**  Governs the effect of actions on registered land and the requirements for Notice of Lis Pendens.
*   **Voluntad v. Spouses Dizon (372 Phil. 82 (1999)):**  Cited by petitioner, this case concerns annotation on the TCT of predecessors-in-interest. Distinguished by the Court due to the lack of connection between petitioner's claim and Isip's title.
*   **Felix Gochan Sons Realty Corporation v. Ca√±ada:** G.R. No. L-49686, August 31, 1988

**Contentious Clauses & Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Isip's Title:** The issuance of TCT No. 769357 to Isip in 1997, despite the property already being subject to a different chain of title emanating from the same original title, raises serious questions about the validity of Isip's title.
*   **Effect of Respondent's Waiver:** The Respondent's waiver and quitclaim acknowledging the Isip's is an admission that is detrimental to the Petitioner's claim, as it may lead to the conclusion that the underlying sale to the Respondent was fraudulent and therefore the Petitioner does not have standing in the suit.

**Analysis & Strategy:**

The Court found the denial of *lis pendens* appropriate. Petitioner is claiming a superior right to the property, but this right is not from the Isip title but rather from a supposed original transaction. The Isips have no standing in the original action, and therefore annotation of *lis pendens* to their title may not be appropriate.
