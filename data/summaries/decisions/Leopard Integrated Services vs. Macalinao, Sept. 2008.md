**Legal Document Summary: Leopard Integrated Services, Inc. vs. Macalinao, G.R. No. 159808**

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) resolution which reversed the Labor Arbiter's (LA) decision dismissing an illegal dismissal case.

**Parties:**
*   Petitioners: Leopard Integrated Services, Inc. and/or Jose Poe (Employer)
*   Respondent: Virgilio Macalinao (Employee/Security Guard)

**Key Issue:** Whether Macalinao was illegally dismissed or voluntarily abandoned his employment.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) **reversed** the CA and NLRC decisions, reinstating the LA's dismissal of Macalinao's complaint. The SC found that Macalinao was not dismissed but went on AWOL (absence without leave).

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Employee's Claim:** Macalinao alleged illegal dismissal due to being placed on "floating status." He claims he didn't receive a report-to-work order.
*   **Employer's Claim:** Leopard Integrated Services, Inc. (LISI) argued Macalinao abandoned his post after being relieved and instructed to report to headquarters. Presented a letter-memorandum as evidence.
*   **"Floating Status":** While relief and transfer are common in security services, the court found that the transfer was not made in bad faith or abuse of discretion, thus the contract has not been severed.
*   **Letter-Memorandum (October 10, 1998):** LISI claimed it sent a letter instructing Macalinao to report to the HRD manager, which Macalinao denied receiving, stating he had moved. SC found this bolstered LISI's claim, as Macalinao hadn't updated his address.
*   **NLRC's Error:** The NLRC erroneously interpreted the registry return receipt date (October 14, 1999 instead of October 14, 1998), leading to a false conclusion that the letter was belated. SC corrected this based on the Postmaster's certification.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The SC emphasized the employee's burden to prove dismissal with clear, positive, and convincing evidence, which Macalinao failed to provide. LISI showed that Macalinao was given an opportunity to return to work but he refused.
*   **Reinstatement and Backwages:** Because there was no illegal dismissal, reinstatement and backwages are inappropriate.
*   **Subsequent Employment:** During the CA proceedings, the respondent was admitted into employment and given a posting, which showed lack of intent to resume working.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Litigation:** While LISI prevailed, Macalinao could potentially pursue other claims if further evidence surfaces.
*   **Precedent:**  This case highlights the importance of proper documentation and communication in employee transfers, especially in the security industry.
*   **Ambiguity:** The NLRCâ€™s initial erroneous interpretation of the mailing date demonstrates the risk of misinterpreting documentation and the need for meticulous review of evidence.

**Contention:**

*   **Letter-Memorandum Receipt Date:** Whether the HRD sent the letter memorandum.
