## Legal Document Summary - *Sps. Belen v. Hon. Chavez and Sps. Pacleb* (G.R. No. 175334, March 26, 2008)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a Petition for Certiorari. The CA upheld the RTC's denial of the petitioners' (Sps. Belen) Motion to Quash Writ of Execution and Motion for Reconsideration. The original action was for enforcement of a foreign judgment (California) later amended to a claim for breach of contract.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Foreign Judgment & Amendment:** Initially, the case involved the enforcement of a California judgment. The complaint was amended to a breach of contract claim for P2,810,234.50. This change introduces potential issues of res judicata and possibly improper amendment of pleadings if the amended claim arises from a completely different cause of action.
*   **Jurisdiction over the Persons of the Belens:** The crucial issue is whether the RTC acquired jurisdiction over the Sps. Belen.  The Court emphasizes the distinction between *in personam*, *in rem*, and *quasi in rem* actions, citing *Asiavest Limited v. Court of Appeals* (357 Phil. 536 (1998)). Service of summons was made at a Laguna address despite evidence (including the Belens' answer and testimony of Rioveros) indicating the Belens are residents of California, U.S.A..
*   **Appearance of Atty. Alcantara:** While initial service was defective, the Court holds that Atty. Alcantara's appearance and filing of pleadings (including a copy of Domingo Belen's U.S. passport identification page and a judgment of dismissal supposedly provided by the Belens) constituted voluntary submission to the RTC's jurisdiction.
*   **Service of the RTC Decision:** Service of the RTC Decision is disputed. The Court rules that service to deceased Atty. Alcantara and service to a third party at the Belens' *former* address in Laguna are both ineffective. Citing Rule 13, Sec. 7, the Court emphasizes that service by registered mail requires a *present* address. Cases such as *Heirs of Delos Santos v. Del Rosario* (G.R. No. 139167, 29 June 2005, 462 SCRA 98) and *PLDT v. NLRC* (No. L-60050, 213 Phil. 362 (1984)) are invoked to underscore the strict construction of service requirements.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** Because the RTC Decision was deemed served only when received by Atty. Culvera, the subsequent notice of appeal was found to be timely.

**Obligations:**

*   The original RTC decision ordered the Belens to pay specific amounts as detailed in the decision.
*   The ruling orders the RTC to give due course to the Notice of Appeal filed by Atty. Culvera.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability for the monetary judgment if it is ultimately upheld on appeal.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdictional Question:**  While the Court finds voluntary submission due to Atty. Alcantara's appearance, a strong argument exists that the initial defective service prejudiced the Belens and that the actions of Atty. Alcantara may not have been sufficiently authorized. This remains a contentious area.
*   **Res Judicata/Improper Amendment:** The amendment of the complaint from enforcing a foreign judgment to a breach of contract claim raises potential defenses of *res judicata* if the breach of contract claim was already litigated in the California case, or should have been raised in that case. Further, the amendment may have improperly introduced a completely different cause of action.
*   **Factual Disputes:** The case hinges heavily on factual disputes regarding residency, authorization of counsel, and proper service. These may be difficult to resolve conclusively based on the existing record.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 13 of the Rules of Court (Service and Filing of Pleadings)
*   Rule 14 of the Rules of Court (Summons)
*   Rule 45 of the Rules of Civil Procedure (Appeal by Certiorari to the Supreme Court)

**Case Law References:**

*   *Asiavest Limited v. Court of Appeals* (357 Phil. 536 (1998))
*   *Heirs of Delos Santos v. Del Rosario* (G.R. No. 139167, 29 June 2005, 462 SCRA 98)
*   *PLDT v. NLRC* (No. L-60050, 213 Phil. 362 (1984))
*   *Valmonte v. Court of Appeals* (322 Phil. 97 (1996))
* *Manotoc v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No.130974, 16 August 2006, 499 SCRA 21, 33)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court granted the petition, reversed the CA, and ordered the RTC to give due course to the Belens' Notice of Appeal. This decision hinges on the improper service of the RTC Decision after the death of the original counsel. While the Court upheld the RTC's initial acquisition of jurisdiction, the procedural errors in serving the decision allowed the Belens to pursue their appeal. The case presents potential arguments regarding jurisdiction, res judicata and improper amendment. Counsel should carefully assess the record and consider these issues on remand.
