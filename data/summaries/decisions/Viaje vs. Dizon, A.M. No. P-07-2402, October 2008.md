**Summary of A.M. No. P-07-2402**

This is an administrative case filed by Atty. Redentor S. Viaje against Rolando A. Dizon, Sheriff IV, for dishonesty and grave misconduct related to the implementation of a writ of execution in an ejectment case (Civil Case No. 1946).  The Supreme Court ultimately found Sheriff Dizon **GUILTY of Simple Neglect of Duty** and ordered him **SUSPENDED without pay for one (1) month and one (1) day.** The charges of Grave Misconduct and Dishonesty were DISMISSED due to lack of substantial evidence, stemming from the complainant's (Atty. Viaje's) failure to attend hearings.

**Key Provisions & Obligations Violated:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 141, Section 10(l):** Dizon failed to prepare and submit to the court for approval a statement of estimated expenses for implementing the writ. His suggestion to the representative of the plaintiff and waiting for approval was deemed insufficient.
*   **Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 39, Section 14 (1997):** Dizon failed to make periodic returns (every 30 days) on the implementation of the writ of execution. He received the writ on October 6, 2006, but only made one return on March 16, 2007.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Simple Neglect of Duty:**  Classified under Section 52, B(1), Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. Dizon received the penalty of suspension without pay for one month and one day.
*   Implicitly, the case emphasizes a sheriff's failure to meet professional standards, as emphasized under *Flores v. Marquez, A.M. No. P-06-2277, December 6, 2006, 510 SCRA 35.* The SC emphasizes the importance of professionalism and public accountability of sheriffs.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Evidentiary Threshold:**  The case highlights the importance of a complainant meeting the evidentiary burden in administrative cases. The dismissal of the more serious charges demonstrates the courts reluctance to impose severer penalties without substantial evidence.
*   **Mitigating Factors:** The absence of a demonstrable corrupt motive was potentially mitigating, leading to the lesser charge of simple neglect.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Ebero v. Camposano, 469 Phil. 426, 432 (2004):** Reinforces the complainant's burden of proving allegations with substantial evidence.
*   **Dela Cruz v. Bato, A.M. No. P-05-1959, February 15, 2004, 451 SCRA 330, 337:**  Affirms the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty, absent contrary evidence.
*   **Flores v. Marquez, A.M. No. P-06-2277, December 6, 2006, 510 SCRA 35:** Emphasizes the high standard of professionalism and public accountability expected of sheriffs.

**Analysis for Legal Counsel:**

This case provides a clear example of the administrative liability a sheriff can incur for failing to follow prescribed procedures in implementing writs of execution, even without demonstrably corrupt intent.  The key takeaway is the strict adherence to the Rules of Court and Rules of Civil Procedure regarding expenses and periodic reporting.  It highlights the importance of sheriffs taking initiative in fulfilling their duties, rather than relying on the parties to prompt them, and the consequences of failing to meet deadlines. Future cases involving sheriffs should focus on compliance with procedural rules, documentation, and timely reporting to mitigate potential liability.
