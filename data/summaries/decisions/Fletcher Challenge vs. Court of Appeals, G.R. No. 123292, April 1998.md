**Legal Document Summary: *Fletcher Challenge Petroleum Philippines, Limited, et al. v. The Court of Appeals, et al.***

**Case Citation:** 352 Phil. 92 (G.R. No. 123292, April 20, 1998)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Fletcher Challenge Petroleum Philippines, Limited, et al. (consortium members)
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals, Philodrill Corporation, et al. (other consortium members)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for review of the Court of Appeals' resolution dismissing petitioners' appeal from the RTC's dismissal of both the original complaint and the counterclaim. The core issue stems from a dispute over cash call defaults, the assignment of shares in oil exploration blocks, and the expulsion of respondents from the consortium.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

1.  **Cash Call Defaults & Expulsion:** Respondents defaulted on cash calls, leading to the purported assignment of their shares in Block A and subsequent expulsion from the consortium concerning both Block A and B.

2.  **Dismissal of Complaint and Counterclaim:** The RTC dismissed both the complaint filed by the respondents and the counterclaim filed by the petitioners. The dismissal of the counterclaim is the main point of contention in this petition.

3.  **Procedural Issues:** The primary legal issue is whether the RTC validly dismissed the petitioners' counterclaim, specifically addressing alleged lack of notice and hearing on the motion to dismiss. The court found the petitioners waived the right to a hearing through inaction. This case also had a debate of whether or not it was right to bring the issue to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals.

**Key Arguments:**

*   **Petitioners' Argument:** RTC erred in dismissing the counterclaim without proper notice and hearing, violating Rule 17, ยง2. They claim the motion to dismiss was improperly included in a reply memorandum.

*   **Respondents' Argument:** The motion to dismiss the counterclaim was properly before the court, having been raised in their answer to the counterclaim. The dismissal of the main action justified the dismissal of the counterclaim.

**Court of Appeals Ruling:** Dismissed petitioners' appeal, holding they should have filed an ordinary appeal because the issue involved factual questions.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** Denied the petition for review. The Supreme Court held that the referral to the Court of Appeals implied a finding of factual issues, which has become final. The Court also found that any procedural error in dismissing the counterclaim was waived by petitioners' failure to object or request a hearing on the new ground in the reply.

**Statutory and Case Law References:**

*   **Rule 17, ยง2 of the Rules of Court:** Governs dismissal of actions by order of the court, including the protection of counterclaims.

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 9:** Defines the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.

*   ***Metals Engineering Resources Corp. v. Court of Appeals*, 203 SCRA 273 (1991):** (Overruled in part) Initially cited to support the automatic dismissal of a counterclaim upon dismissal of the main action. The Supreme Court clarified that this applies only when the court lacks jurisdiction over the main action.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are obligated to pursue the counterclaim in a separate action if they wish to recover the defaulted cash calls.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Res Judicata/Collateral Estoppel:** Unclear if the findings in this case, particularly regarding the validity of the initial dismissal, could impact a future separate action on the counterclaim.
*   **Statute of Limitations:** Risk that the statute of limitations may bar a separate action to recover the cash call defaults.
*   **Proving Damages:** Petitioners will need to prove the exact amounts owed and the validity of interest and other charges claimed in the counterclaim.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Overlooked" Admission:** The trial court's statement that it "overlooked" the requirements of Rule 17, ยง2 is ambiguous and open to interpretation. The Supreme Court interpreted this to mean the trial court felt compliance was unnecessary due to the clarity of the parties' positions.
*   **Waiver of Hearing:** The finding that petitioners waived their right to a hearing is contentious, as it hinges on the receipt of the reply memorandum and the failure to promptly object or request a hearing.

**Recommendations:**

*   Petitioners should immediately evaluate the viability of filing a separate action to recover the defaulted cash calls, considering the statute of limitations and the evidence available.
*   Thoroughly analyze the potential preclusive effects of the prior dismissal on a future claim.
*   Ensure meticulous compliance with procedural requirements in any future litigation arising from this dispute.
