**Case Summary: *Bier v. Bier*, G.R. No. 173294 (2008)**

This case is a petition for review on certiorari seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision which overturned the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) declaration of nullity of marriage between petitioner Renne Enrique Bier and respondent Ma. Lourdes Bier. The petitioner sought annulment based on the respondent's alleged psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's Claim:** Psychological incapacity of the respondent due to a narcissistic personality disorder, resulting in neglect of marital duties, alcoholism, chain-smoking, abandonment, and refusal of sexual relations.

*   **RTC Decision:** Granted the petition, declaring the marriage void based on psychological incapacity.

*   **CA Decision:** Reversed the RTC decision, stating the petitioner failed to comply with the guidelines set forth in *Republic v. CA and Molina*, 335 Phil 664 (1997), specifically regarding the identification of the root cause, gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability of the alleged psychological incapacity.

*   **Petitioner's Counter-Argument (on Appeal):** Strict compliance with *Molina* is not required, as the guidelines are merely directory. Argues sufficient evidence was presented to prove psychological incapacity, even without strict adherence to *Molina*.

**Key Holdings & Case Law:**

*   **Reliance on *Molina*:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision, reiterating the importance of establishing gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability of psychological incapacity, even if *Molina* is not a strict checklist.

*   **Burden of Proof:** The petitioner bears the burden of proving the nullity of the marriage. The SC found the petitioner failed to meet this burden.

*   **Hearsay Evidence:** The psychological report presented by the petitioner was deemed unreliable because it was based solely on information provided by the petitioner himself. The psychologist never personally examined the respondent, making her testimony and report hearsay. (citing *Republic v. Tanyag-San Jose, G.R. No. 168328, 28 February 2007*)

*   **Acts Insufficient for Psychological Incapacity:** Habitual alcoholism, chain-smoking, failure to meet marital duties, and abandonment, *alone*, are insufficient to establish psychological incapacity without proof of an underlying psychological (not merely physical) illness. (citing *Republic v. Tanyag-San Jose, G.R. No. 168328, 28 February 2007*, and *Republic v. CA*, supra note 4)

*   **Importance of Juridical Antecedence:** The SC also cited *Santos v. CA*, 310 Phil 22 (1995), emphasizing that the psychological incapacity must be rooted in the history of the party *antedating the marriage*, with overt manifestations possibly emerging only after the marriage. This was not established.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Psychological Incapacity":** The interpretation of Article 36 of the Family Code remains subjective and case-specific, as noted by Justice Caguioa during Congressional hearings. This creates uncertainty in predicting outcomes.

*   **Evidentiary Standard:** The SCâ€™s consistent emphasis on proving gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability makes it difficult to obtain a declaration of nullity based on psychological incapacity without substantial, reliable (non-hearsay) evidence, often requiring expert testimony based on personal evaluation of the respondent.

*   **Risk of Collusion:** The lack of participation of one party raises the risk of collusion. The OSG is tasked with preventing fabrication of evidence, but its effectiveness depends on thorough investigation.

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** To present sufficient evidence to prove the gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability of the respondent's alleged psychological incapacity.

*   **State's Obligation (via OSG):** To ensure there is no collusion between the parties and that evidence is not fabricated, protecting the sanctity of marriage.

**Conclusion:**

This case reinforces the stringent requirements for declaring a marriage null based on psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code. It highlights the need for robust, independent evidence demonstrating the gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability of the alleged psychological incapacity. The reliance on *Molina* remains significant, and hearsay evidence is insufficient to meet the burden of proof. Without direct evidence and expert assessment, a petition is unlikely to succeed.
