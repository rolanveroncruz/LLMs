## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Opeña

This document is a Supreme Court Decision (G.R. No. 220490) affirming the conviction of Alfredo Opeña y Baclagon (Appellant) for the crime of rape under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended. The victim is his biological daughter, referred to as "AAA".

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Rape under Article 266-A(1) of the RPC, as amended, specifically carnal knowledge of a woman through force or intimidation.
*   **Facts:** The Appellant was found guilty of raping his daughter, AAA, in their home. AAA reported the abuse to her aunt, leading to the Appellant's arrest. Medical examination showed evidence of healed lacerations consistent with forced penetration.
*   **Evidence:** The RTC and CA found AAA's testimony credible and straightforward. The medical report (Medico-Legal Report No. R07-902) supported the claim of trauma. The Appellant's defense of denial was deemed insufficient.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** The Supreme Court addressed the argument of delay in reporting (9 years), citing *People v. Coloma* and *People v. Cañada*, holding that delay is understandable, especially when attributed to fear and the power dynamic between the offender and victim.
*   **Force/Intimidation:** The Court states that the requirement of force or intimidation may be satisfied by the moral ascendancy of the father over the daughter as per *People v. Galvez*.
*   **Resistance:** The Court reiterated that resistance is not a necessary element in rape, and that failure to shout is not indicative of consent (*People v. Rubio*). AAA was also threatened.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The Court applied the principle of according great weight to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua was imposed.
*   **Damages:** The Supreme Court modified the CA's decision, increasing damages. Civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages were increased to P75,000 each. These amounts will bear interest at 6% per annum from the finality of the decision until fully paid, as per *People v. Jugueta*.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** Relationship was an aggravating circumstance but did not alter the penalty as the single indivisible penalty of *reclusion perpetua* shall be imposed regardless of any modifying circumstance pursuant to Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellant is obligated to serve the sentence of Reclusion Perpetua.
*   Appellant is obligated to pay AAA P75,000 for civil indemnity, P75,000 for moral damages, and P75,000 for exemplary damages, with 6% interest per annum from the finality of the decision.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal Liability for rape under Article 266-A(1) of the RPC.
*   Civil Liability for damages to the victim.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **None identified within the document itself.** The decision appears to be a straightforward affirmation of the lower court's judgment.
*   **Aggravating circumstance consideration:** The court noted that though the lower courts appreciated the presence of an aggravating circumstance, it would not alter the penalty already prescribed by the law.
*   **Reliance on Jurisprudence:** The decision heavily relies on established jurisprudence concerning delayed reporting of rape and the influence of familial relationships.
