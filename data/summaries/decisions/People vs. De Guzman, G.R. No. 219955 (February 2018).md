## Legal Document Summary - *People v. De Guzman*, G.R. No. 219955 (2018)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) Decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Glenn De Guzman for violating Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession) of Article II of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

**Holding:**  Supreme Court REVERSED the CA decision, ACQUITTING De Guzman due to the prosecution's failure to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because of a broken chain of custody for the seized marijuana.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Illegal sale and possession of marijuana (violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165).
*   **Corpus Delicti & Chain of Custody:** The core issue is the integrity of the *corpus delicti* (the marijuana). The Court emphasizes that the prosecution must establish an unbroken chain of custody to prove the seized drugs are the same as those presented in court, citing *People v. Denoman* (612 Phil. 1165).
*   **Section 21, RA 9165:**  The ruling hinges on the police's failure to comply strictly with the procedural safeguards outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165, particularly concerning:
    *   **Marking:** Delayed marking (at the police station, not at the scene), not done in the presence of the accused.
    *   **Inventory:** Absence of representatives from the DOJ and media during the physical inventory and photography.
*   **Chain of Custody Breaks:**
    1.  Gap between seizure and delivery to the police station: No testimony regarding the handling and custody of the seized items from the place of arrest to the police station.
    2.  Investigating officer to forensic chemist: Lack of testimony identifying all individuals who handled the evidence during the transfer from SPO1 Delos Reyes to the crime lab.
    3.  Forensic chemist to court: The PNP Crime Laboratory improperly turned over custody to the City Prosecutor's Office, which is not part of the chain of custody, before submission to the court. The Forensic Chemist did not testify and stipulations were made on her findings.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution Obligation:** The prosecution has the burden to:
    *   Prove each element of the crimes charged beyond reasonable doubt.
    *   Demonstrate an unbroken chain of custody, including the handling of the evidence by each individual from seizure to presentation in court.
    *   Explain any deviations from the Section 21 procedure and demonstrate the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved despite the non-compliance, citing *People v. Prudencio*.
*   **Potential Liabilities:** The Court doesn't explicitly discuss liabilities. However, it alludes to a potential liability for the PNP Crime Laboratory improperly turning over custody to the City Prosecutor's Office.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Denoman* (612 Phil. 1165): Stresses the need to preserve the identity and integrity of the corpus delicti.
*   *Derilo v. People* (784 Phil. 679):  Lays down guidelines for showing an unbroken chain of custody.
*   *People v. Prudencio*: Addresses the saving mechanism under Sec. 21 and when non-compliance may be excused.
*   *People v. Partoza* (605 Phil. 1583): Requires presentation in court of evidence of corpus delicti.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The lower courts improperly applied the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties because the irregular handling of evidence invalidated that presumption.
*   **Lack of Explanation:** The prosecution failed to offer justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21 requirements, proving fatal to the case.
*   **Stipulation of Forensic Chemist's Testimony:** While stipulations are generally acceptable, in drug cases involving chain of custody issues, the absence of direct testimony from the forensic chemist weakens the prosecution's case significantly.
*   **Saving Clause Misapplication:** The "saving clause" in Sec. 21 RA 9165 was misapplied because there were no justifiable grounds for non-compliance and the integrity of the evidence was not demonstrably preserved.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court, in *People v. De Guzman*, underscores the importance of strict adherence to the chain of custody rule in drug cases, particularly Section 21 of RA 9165. This case serves as a reminder to law enforcement of the serious consequences of procedural lapses and their responsibility to ensure the integrity of the evidence collected and presented in court. The ruling also highlights the prosecution's burden to prove an unbroken chain of custody when irregularities are present.
