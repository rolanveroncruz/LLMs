**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision regarding an administrative complaint against a Regional Trial Court Judge and subsequent disciplinary action against the complainant's lawyers.

**Parties:**
*   **Complainant:** Juan Pablo P. Bondoc, former Representative of Pampanga.
*   **Respondent:** Judge Divina Luz P. Aquino-Simbulan, Regional Trial Court, Branch 41, San Fernando City, Pampanga.
*   **Subject of Disciplinary Action:** Attorneys Stephen David and Lanee Cui-David (Complainant's counsel).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Complainant's Allegations against Judge:** Partiality, gross ignorance of the law, and gross misconduct in handling Criminal Case Nos. 12726-12728 (Violations of R.A. 3019 and Falsification of Public Documents).  Specific allegations include attempting to settle the case to prevent administrative suspension of the accused, "fast-tracking" the case in favor of the accused due to their suspension pendente lite, inaction on the suspension order, undue pressure on a government witness, and alleged humiliation of complainant's counsel (Atty. Lanee David) in court. The complaint culminated with the grant of a Demurrer to Evidence in favor of the accused.

*   **Judge's Defense:** Denied all allegations, arguing that the complaint was fabricated by the private prosecutors (Attys. Stephen and Lanee David) to conceal their own failings in prosecuting the case. Argued that her actions were aimed at efficient case management and denied any partiality.

*   **Disciplinary Action Against Lawyers:** Based on A.M. No. 03-10-01-SC (Resolution Prescribing Measures to Protect Members of the Judiciary from Baseless and Unfounded Administrative Complaints), Attorneys David were found guilty of indirect contempt for misleading the complainant, fabricating or exaggerating allegations, and for their lack of candor to the Court, in violation of Canon 18, Rule 18.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (candor, fairness, good faith).

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   **Attorneys David:** Held liable for Indirect Contempt under Section 3, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court for violating A.M. No. 03-10-01-SC. Fined P2,500.00 each.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Disputes:**  The core of the case revolved around conflicting factual accounts of courtroom proceedings, making credibility a central issue. The Supreme Court relied heavily on its assessment of the trial transcript and other documentary evidence.

*   **Interpretation of A.M. No. 03-10-01-SC:**  This case serves as an interpretation of the scope and application of A.M. No. 03-10-01-SC, clarifying the limitations on a lawyer's advocacy and duty to a client when balanced against their duty to the Court and the administration of justice.
