## Legal Document Summary: *Punio v. Go and Magcalas* (A.M. No. MTJ-97-1116)

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Judge Francisco J. Go (MTC, Pila, Laguna) for refusing to issue a Writ of Demolition in an ejectment case (Civil Case No. 869) after a Writ of Execution had already been issued. Sheriff Magcalas was initially included but the complaint against him was dismissed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Final and Executory Judgment:** Civil Case No. 869 (ejectment) had a final judgment in favor of Punio's mother, ordering the defendant to vacate, pay rent, attorney's fees, and costs.
*   **Writ of Execution:** Issued on May 30, 1995.
*   **Motion for Demolition:** Filed by plaintiff, seeking demolition of structures on the property.
*   **Judge Go's Deferral:** Judge Go deferred action on the Motion for Demolition pending resolution of Civil Case No. SC-2953 (annulment of title) in the RTC.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Judge Go's Error:** The Supreme Court (SC) found that Judge Go erred in deferring the demolition order. Section 8 of Rule 70 of the Rules of Court mandates immediate execution in ejectment cases.
*   **Ministerial Duty:** The SC reiterates that the issuance of a writ of execution after a final judgment in an ejectment case is a ministerial duty.
*   **Annulment of Title Irrelevant:** Pendency of an action to annul title does not abate an ejectment suit or bar execution. The SC cites *Soco vs. Court of Appeals, 263 SCRA 449, 458* and *San Pedro vs. Court of Appeals, 235 SCRA 145* confirming that ejectment focuses on *de facto* possession, while annulment concerns ownership.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70, Section 8, Rules of Court:** Mandates immediate execution in ejectment cases.
*   **Republic vs. Angeles, 20 SCRA 608:** Cited by Investigating Judge Hilario F. Corcuera.
*   **Puncia vs. Gerona, 252 SCRA 425, 430:** Affirms the court's practically ministerial duty to order immediate execution in ejectment cases.
*   **Soco vs. Court of Appeals, 263 SCRA 449, 458:** Reiterates the distinction between ejectment suits (possession *de facto*) and annulment actions (ownership).
*   **San Pedro vs. Court of Appeals, 235 SCRA 145:** Reinforces the distinction of ejectment suits and annulment actions.
*   **Dante vs. Sison, 174 SCRA 517:** Reinforces the distinction of ejectment suits and annulment actions.
*   **Manlavi vs. Gacott, Jr., 244 SCRA 50:** Concerns administrative liability of judges.
*   **Boquiren vs. Del Rosario-Cruz, 244 SCRA 702:** Concerns administrative liability of judges.
*   **Alvarado vs. Laquindanum, 245 SCRA 501:** Concerns administrative liability of judges.
*   **Chin vs. Gustilo, 247 SCRA 175,182:** Concerns a judge's duty to keep abreast of laws and precedents.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   While Judge Go's actions were deemed erroneous, the SC considered it an error in judgment, not an act of malice, fraud, or bad faith. This mitigating factor reduced the penalty.
*   Despite finding that Judge Go made an error, the SC acknowledges that the pendency of Civil Case No. SC-2953 created a conflict.

**Outcome:**

*   The complaint against Sheriff Magcalas was dismissed.
*   Judge Go was reprimanded and warned against repeating similar actions.

**Advise:** Though the case has been ruled upon, this ruling is still relevant as precedent on the obligations of the judge to carry out a demolition order under a writ of execution.
