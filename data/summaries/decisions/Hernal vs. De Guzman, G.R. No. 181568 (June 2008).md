**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Manalo P. Hernal, Jr. and Mildred Villaroman-Hernal vs. Spouses Paulino De Guzman, Jr. and Ana Dizon-De Guzman***

**Case:** G.R. No. 181568, June 26, 2008 (578 Phil. 562)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the CA's decision regarding the timeliness of an appeal.

**Key Issue:** Whether the appeal period commenced upon the *respondents'* receipt of the RTC resolution or upon *their counsel's* receipt. The Supreme Court held the appeal was untimely.

**Facts:**

*   Respondent spouses (De Guzmans) filed a complaint for legal redemption with damages against petitioner spouses (Hernals).
*   RTC initially dismissed the complaint due to the De Guzmans' failure to tender payment within the statutory period.
*   De Guzmans filed a Motion for Reconsideration which lacked a notice of hearing, so it was considered a scrap of paper.
*   The De Guzmans subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal which was denied by the RTC as being filed out of time.
*   The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the RTC, holding that the appeal period commenced upon counsel's receipt of the RTC decision, not the client's. Therefore, the Notice of Appeal was filed within the reglementary period.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA, holding that the appeal was indeed untimely. The SC reasoned that while service on counsel is generally required, the *respondents' counsel's* actual knowledge of the RTC decision (evidenced by filing a Motion for Reconsideration referencing the date the *respondents* received the decision) negates any claim of lack of notice.

**Key Provisions/Rules Cited:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari.
*   **Rule 7, Section 3, Rules of Court:** Signature of counsel on a pleading constitutes certification of having read the pleading and factual basis.
*   **Statute on Legal Redemption:** The underlying cause of action involves statutory rights of legal redemption. The Court did not delve into the merits of this statute, focusing solely on the procedural issue of timeliness.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Santiago v. Guadiz, G.R. No. 85923, 26 February 1992, 206 SCRA 590, 597:**  Cited by the SC to support the proposition that actual notice of a decision renders formal service less critical, particularly when a motion for reconsideration has been filed.
*   **Neypes v. CA, G.R. No. 141524, 14 September 2005, 469 SCRA 633:** Distinguishes this case, noting Neypes applies where a Motion for Reconsideration was duly and timely filed, unlike the case at bar, where the Motion lacked a notice of hearing.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Notice of Hearing Defect:** The primary reason the motion for reconsideration was considered a “scrap of paper” was the lack of notice of hearing. This is a key point of vulnerability. If the motion had been proper, the outcome might have been different.
*   **"Actual Notice" Standard:** While seemingly straightforward in this case, the "actual notice" standard can be litigated and less clear-cut in other scenarios. The SC's reliance on the attorney's express reference to the client's receipt date in the motion for reconsideration was critical.

**Implications:**

This case underscores the importance of strict compliance with procedural rules, particularly regarding the perfection of appeals. It also highlights the potential for an attorney's actions/statements to bind their client, even unintentionally.
