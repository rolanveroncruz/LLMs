**Case Summary: *JOSEPH PETER SISON, et al. vs. ROGELIO TABLANG, et al.* (G.R. No. 177011, June 05, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing the COA ASB's decision affirming Notices of Disallowance (ND) for honoraria paid to NHA's Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) and Technical Working Group (TWG) members.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Disallowance of Honoraria:** COA disallowed honoraria payments totaling P364,299.31 to petitioners due to:
    *   Lack of legal basis for payments made before DBM guidelines.
    *   Payments exceeding rates allowed by DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5.
*   **RA 9184, Section 15:** Authorizes honoraria for BAC members, capped at 25% of basic monthly salary, *subject to availability of funds and DBM guidelines*.
*   **DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5:** Prescribes guidelines for honoraria, limiting payments to *successfully completed procurement projects* and capping the monthly total at 25% of basic salary. (clarified in DBM Budget Circular No. 2004-5A dated October 7, 2005, a procurement project shall be considered successfully completed once the contract has been awarded to the winning bidder).
*   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** Petitioners failed to appeal the ASB decision to the COA Proper before seeking judicial review.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable to refund the disallowed honoraria. Their request for a set-off against unpaid COLA or future honoraria was denied.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Disallowance:** Failure to exhaust administrative remedies renders the disallowance final and executory. (*Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Employees Union, Regional Office No. VII, Cebu City v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 169815, August 13, 2008.*)
*   **Personal Liability:** As recipients of the disallowed funds, petitioners are primarily liable for the refund.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Successfully Completed Procurement Projects":** The ambiguity surrounding what constitutes a "successfully completed procurement project" was addressed by DBM Circular No. 2004-5A.
*   **Retroactive Application of DBM Guidelines:** The COA essentially applied the DBM guidelines retroactively, disallowing payments made before their promulgation, arguing that Section 15 of RA 9184 was not self-executing.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   The failure to exhaust administrative remedies is a significant procedural hurdle. Any potential legal strategy would need to overcome this defect or demonstrate a valid exception to the doctrine.
*   The reliance on DBM guidelines as the sole basis for determining the legality of the honoraria payments is a crucial point. Arguments could focus on whether the pre-guideline payments were made in good faith and in accordance with a reasonable interpretation of RA 9184 at the time, although this is a weak point given that the DBM guidelines are mandatory.
*   The court emphasizes the nature of honoraria as discretionary and not demandable as a matter of right.
