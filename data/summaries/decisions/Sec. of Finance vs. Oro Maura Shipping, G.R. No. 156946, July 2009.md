Okay, here's a concise legal summary of *Secretary of Finance vs. Oro Maura Shipping Lines*, G.R. No. 156946, July 15, 2009:

**Case Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over the re-assessment of customs duties on a vessel, M/V "HARUNA," initially imported under a bareboat charter agreement by Glory Shipping Lines.  The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, ruling in favor of the Secretary of Finance and upholding the re-assessment of the vessel's value based on the initial entered value at the Port of Mactan, without depreciation, and including other charges due.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Initial Bareboat Charter:** Glory Shipping Lines imported M/V "HARUNA" under a bareboat charter and posted a re-export bond (Ordinary Re-Export Bond No. C(9) 121818) conditioned on re-exportation or payment of duties.
*   **Sale of Vessel:** Glory Shipping Lines sold the vessel to Oro Maura Shipping Lines (Respondent) without notifying the Collector of the Port of Mactan.
*   **Respondent's Actions:** Respondent applied for an "Authority to Import" from MARINA after the vessel was already in the Philippines and secured a lower valuation. Filed Import Entry No. 179260 at the Port of Manila, paid duties of P149,989.00 based on this valuation.
*   **Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (TCCP):**
    *   **Section 2530:** Violated due to undervaluation and fraudulent transaction, leading to initial forfeiture proceedings.
    *   **Section 2503:** Cited regarding undervaluation, misclassification, and misdeclaration of entry, specifically the 10% and 30% thresholds for surcharges and prima facie evidence of fraud, respectively.
    *   **Section 201:** Basis of Dutiable Value, requiring valuation based on fair market value at the time of exportation, excluding depreciation.
    *   **Section 1202:** Defines when importation begins and terminates, emphasizing that duties must be fully paid for termination.
    *   **Section 1204:** Liability of importer for duties and creates a lien on the imported articles.
    *   **Section 1603:** Finality of Liquidation:  Court found that this did not apply because the purchase was fraudulent.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Respondent's Liability for Deficiency Duties:**  Respondent is liable for the deficiency in customs duties based on the original entered value at the Port of Mactan (P1,296,710.00) which was significantly higher than what was paid at the Port of Manila.
*   **Tax Lien:** The Supreme Court emphasized that a tax lien attached to the vessel upon failure of Glory Shipping Lines to re-export or pay duties. This lien survives the sale of the vessel to the Respondent.  *See TCCP Section 1204.*
*   **Seizure:** The Court permitted seizure proceedings to continue if the unpaid duties, taxes, and charges are not paid, but this was dependent on other taxes and charges.
*   **Fraud:** Court made a determination that the respondent was complicit in fraudulent activity that deprived the state of funds.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (TCCP):** This Code is the primary statutory basis for the decision.
*   **P.D. No. 1464 (Tariff and Customs Code of 1978):**  Cited for Sec. 201, which is the Basis of Dutiable Value.
*  **Intra-Strata Assurance Corporation v. Republic of the Philippines (G.R. No. 156571, July 9, 2008):** Supports the principle that the government is not estopped by the errors of its agents, especially in tax matters.
*  **Chevron Philippines v. Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs (G.R. No. 178759, August 11, 2008):** Importance of collecting tariff and custom duties and the public revenue.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Depreciation:**  The Respondent argued that MARINA's valuation considered depreciation, which justified the lower duties paid in Manila. The Court rejected this, stating the TCCP doesn't allow for it.
*   **"Innocent Purchaser" Claim:** The Court rejected the CA's finding that the Respondent was an "innocent purchaser," concluding that the Respondent knew or should have known of Glory Shipping Lines' non-compliance and actively participated in the scheme to undervalue the vessel.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Government Not Estopped:** The government can rectify errors of its agents in collecting taxes, even if it prejudices a private party.
*   **Tax Liens Survive Transfer:** A tax lien on imported goods survives a transfer of ownership.
*   **Duty of Due Diligence:** Importers have a duty to exercise due diligence and ensure proper declaration and valuation of imported goods.
*   **Fraud Overrides Finality:** Finality of liquidation of import duties under Section 1603 of the TCCP is not absolute and can be overturned in cases of fraud. The facts related to this element were determinative for the court.
