## Legal Document Summary: *Naga College Foundation Education Workers Organization v. Hon. Vito C. Bose and Naga College Foundation*, G.R. No. 122633, April 20, 1998

**Nature:** Petition for Mandamus to compel execution of a final NLRC decision ordering reinstatement and backwages for illegally dismissed employees.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Original NLRC Decision:** Orders Naga College Foundation and Dr. Villanueva to reinstate petitioners to their former positions and pay backwages (Art. 223, Labor Code, as amended by RA 6715, §12).
*   **Compromise Agreement:** Parties agreed to reinstatement on payroll effective September 21, 1992, and payment of salaries and accrued backwages. Respondents defaulted after three installments.
*   **ELA Orders:** ELA initially ordered reinstatement and backwages. Later, ELA denied execution, citing petitioners’ motion for execution filed with the NLRC and ordered separation pay in lieu of reinstatement due to alleged strained relations. ELA treated petitioners' objection to separation pay as an appeal, further delaying execution.

**Obligations:**

*   Respondents: Original obligation to reinstate employees and pay backwages as per the NLRC decision. The later compromise agreement outlines the method of satisfying the reinstatement order by placing them in the payroll.
*   ELA: Obligation to execute the final and executory NLRC decision, which he had unjustifiably delayed.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondents: Liable for reinstatement and payment of full backwages based on the final NLRC decision. The Court also alludes to the employer's liability in creating an unworkable environment due to their non-compliance.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Strained Relations" Argument:** The ELA cited strained relations as a justification for separation pay. The Supreme Court rebukes this application of the doctrine citing *Globe-Mackay Cable and Radio Corp. v. National Labor Relations Commission*, 206 SCRA 701, 712 (1992), stating it cannot be applied indiscriminately and should not arise from asserting one's legal rights.
*   **Abandonment/Rescission of Compromise:** The employer argued that petitioners abandoned the compromise agreement by filing a motion for execution with the NLRC. The Supreme Court rejects this argument as the motion sought to enforce the same right i.e., reinstatement.
*   **Deduction of Income:** The ELA was attempting to ascertain income that the employees earned during the dismissal, which the Court held would amend the final and executory order.
*   **Applicability of *Bustamante v. NLRC*:** The employer argued that *Ferrer v. NLRC* should apply, which allowed deduction of income earned during illegal dismissal from backwages, because it was the prevailing rule when the NLRC decision became final. However, the Supreme Court ruled that *Bustamante v. NLRC* applied, awarding full backwages without deduction, because the cause of action accrued after March 21, 1989, the effective date of RA 6715. The Court noted that the original ELA decision did not include such a deduction.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 223, Labor Code, as amended by RA 6715, §12:** Governs reinstatement orders.
*   **RA 6715:** Amended the Labor Code and provides for full backwages without deduction.
*   ***Globe-Mackay Cable and Radio Corp. v. National Labor Relations Commission*, 206 SCRA 701, 712 (1992):** Sets the limits to the "strained relations" doctrine.
*   ***Ferrer v. NLRC*, 224 SCRA 410, 423 (1993):** Doctrine, now superseded, allowing deduction of income earned during illegal dismissal from backwages.
*   ***Bustamante v. NLRC*, 265 SCRA 61, 70 (1996):** Held that RA 6715 entitles illegally dismissed employees to full backwages without deduction.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court granted the petition for mandamus, annulling the ELA's orders and directing the reinstatement of petitioners with full backwages, reinforcing the principle that final and executory judgments must be executed according to their terms.
