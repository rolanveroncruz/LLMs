**Legal Document Summary: Aguilar v. Court of Appeals, Civil Service Commission and Commission on Elections (G.R. No. 172986)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) decision that dismissed a petition for review due to the alleged late filing of a Motion for Reconsideration before the Civil Service Commission (CSC).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **COMELEC Ruling:** Petitioner (Aguilar), an Election Officer, was found guilty by the COMELEC of Abandonment, Neglect of Duty, and Conduct Unbecoming a Public Officer and was suspended for 6 months.
*   **CSC Ruling:** The CSC dismissed Aguilar's appeal, finding no evidentiary support for his reasons for abandoning his post. The CSC modified the COMELEC resolution by finding Aguilar guilty of Gross Neglect of Duty and Conduct Grossly Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and imposed the penalty of dismissal.
*   **CA Ruling:** The CA dismissed Aguilar's petition, stating the CSC resolution had become final and executory due to the late filing of the Motion for Reconsideration.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   COMELEC imposed a 6-month suspension.
*   CSC modified this to dismissal from service.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** The core issue is the timeliness of Aguilar's Motion for Reconsideration with the CSC. The CA determined it was filed late. The Supreme Court ultimately determined it was one day late, but due to subsequent events still resulting in the original judgement becoming final.
*   **Formal Defect:** Respondents argued for the petition's dismissal because it improperly impleaded the CA. The Court addressed the issue of form and elected to address the substantive merits, and found the CA's claim of lateness to be accurate.
*   **Successive Motions for Reconsideration:** Instead of filing a timely appeal, the petitioner filed a second Motion for Reconsideration and an Urgent Motion for Reinvestigation with the COMELEC, after his first motion was denied. The court argues that the petitioner's subsequent motions for reconsideration rendered the final decision to have lapsed into finality.
*   **Modification of Final Judgement:** The Court deemed that the decision of the CSC was void because it altered a prior, and already final decision made by COMELEC.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The CA and SC disagreed on the precise date of filing of the Motion for Reconsideration, though the date was ultimately deemed not to affect the outcome.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and reinstated Aguilar to his position, with backwages, because the CSC resolution which dismissed him, being a modification of a final and executory judgment, was void.
