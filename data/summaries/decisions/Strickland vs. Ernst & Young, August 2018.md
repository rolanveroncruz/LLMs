Here's a summary of the legal document, formatted for a lawyer's review:

**Case:** *Strickland v. Ernst & Young LLP* (G.R. No. 193782) and *Strickland v. Punongbayan & Araullo* (G.R. No. 210695)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Date:** August 1, 2018

**Issue:** Consolidated petitions concerning the arbitrability of a dispute between Dale Strickland (petitioner) and Ernst & Young LLP (EYLLP) and the propriety of suspending proceedings against Punongbayan & Araullo (PA) pending that arbitration.

**Summary:**

*   **Background:** Strickland, formerly a partner at EYLLP (seconded to Ernst & Young Asia Pacific Financial Solutions - EYAPFS), claims unpaid compensation stemming from his work on a Financial Advisory Services Agreement (FASA) between National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC) and PA (then the Philippine member firm of EYLLP).  After Strickland's departure from EYLLP/EYAPFS, disputes arose regarding his continued participation and compensation. He filed suit against EYLLP, PA, NHMFC, and others.
*   **EYLLP's Position:** EYLLP moved to compel arbitration based on a clause in its Partnership Agreement with Strickland. The Court of Appeals (CA) granted this motion, ordering EYLLP dropped from the civil case. The Supreme Court agreed.
*   **PA's Position:** PA sought suspension of the civil proceedings against it, arguing that any settlement in the arbitration between Strickland and EYLLP would prejudice PA. The CA initially denied the suspension, but it was eventually reversed by the same court. The Supreme Court agreed with the reversal.

**Key Provisions, Obligations, Liabilities, and Potential Risks:**

*   **Arbitration Clause:** The EYLLP Partnership Agreement contains a broad arbitration clause covering disputes between partners and former partners related to the firm's business. This is the linchpin of the ruling.
*   **Agency Relationship:** The court explicitly recognizes PA as acting as an agent of EYLLP in the FASA with NHMFC. This agency relationship shields PA from direct liability for obligations arising from Strickland's partnership agreement with EYLLP.
*   **Separability Doctrine:** The court applies the separability doctrine, holding that the validity of the underlying contract is distinct from the arbitration clause. A party cannot avoid arbitration simply by claiming the main contract is invalid. *Cargill Philippines, Inc. v. San Fernando Regala Trading, Inc.* (G.R. No. 175404, January 31, 2011)
*   **International Commercial Arbitration:** The court classifies the arbitration as international commercial arbitration, given that the place of business of EYLLP is in the US, and Strickland's services were performed in the Philippines. This triggers the application of the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration.
*   **Choice of Law:** The EYLLP Assignment letter contains a choice-of-law clause, specifying US law. The implications of this clause for the arbitration proceedings should be considered.
*   **"Intertwined" Causes of Action:** The Supreme Court agreed with the CA that Strickland's causes of action against PA were intricately intertwined with the dispute subject to arbitration between Strickland and EYLLP, justifying the suspension of proceedings against PA.
* **No Third Party Beneficiary**: The court emphasized that designation of Strickland was not for the purpose of stipulation pour atrui. (Civil Code, Art. 1311)
*   **Potential Risk:** The primary risk lies in the successful navigation of the arbitration proceedings. The outcome of the arbitration directly impacts the viability of Strickland's claims against PA.

**Recommendations:**

1.  Thoroughly review the EYLLP Partnership Agreement, particularly the arbitration clause and any choice-of-law provisions, in light of US arbitration law.
2.  Assess the strength of Strickland's claim for compensation, considering the agency relationship between PA and EYLLP and the lack of a direct contractual relationship between Strickland and PA or NHMFC.
3.  Monitor the progress of the arbitration proceedings closely, as its outcome will significantly impact the potential for recovery against PA.
4.  Analyze the conflict of laws. Philippine law is not automatically the law of the place of performance of the contract nor is it the only factor to be considered in the ultimate choice-ofÂ­ law final analysis.
