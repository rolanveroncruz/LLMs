**Case Summary: *De Grano v. Lacaba*, G.R. No. 158877 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that reversed lower court rulings in a forcible entry case.

**Key Issue:** Whether Lacaba (respondent) established prior physical possession sufficient to maintain a forcible entry action against De Grano (petitioner). Relatedly, whether the CA erred in taking cognizance of a late Petition for Review.

**Summary of Facts:**

*   Lacaba filed a forcible entry complaint against De Grano, alleging he was in prior possession of two parcels of land through caretakers and occupants he permitted on the land, and that De Grano, using force, destroyed a fence, cleared the land, and demolished a house. Lacaba presented tax declarations, tax receipts, and a certification from the municipal assessor.
*   De Grano countered that he was acting on instructions of the Malabanan family, who held title to the property. He presented TCT No. T-31929, cancellation of Lacaba's relocation survey plan, a consolidation and subdivision plan, and affidavits from occupants stating they were permitted by the Malabanans.
*   The MCTC and RTC dismissed Lacaba's complaint. The CA reversed, finding Lacaba had prior possession based on tax payments and disregarding De Grano's evidence.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the CA decision, reinstating the MCTC and RTC rulings dismissing the forcible entry complaint.

**Key Provisions/Analysis:**

*   **Timeliness of Petition:** The SC held that the CA erred in taking cognizance of Lacaba's petition for review because it was filed *well beyond* the reglementary period. The CA should have counted from the original RTC denial of the motion for reconsideration, not a subsequent order merely correcting a clerical error. The delay of approximately seven months was unreasonable. The motion for extension was not timely.
*   **Forcible Entry Requirements:** The SC reiterated that a forcible entry plaintiff must prove prior physical possession and deprivation of that possession through force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth (citing *Gonzaga v. Court of Appeals*).
*   **Proof of Prior Possession:** The SC found Lacaba failed to adequately prove prior physical possession. Tax declarations and receipts are *not conclusive* proof of possession; they are merely indicative of possession in the concept of owner (citing *Estrella v. Robles, Jr.* and *Ganila v. Court of Appeals*). There was no adequate proof of a landlord-tenant relationship. Physical Possession is required, not a legal right.
*   **Possession *de facto* vs. *de jure***: Only prior *physical* possession (possession *de facto*), not legal possession (possession *de jure*), is relevant in a forcible entry case (citing *Tirona v. Alejo* and *Gonzaga v. Court of Appeals*).
*   **Ownership Not at Issue:** The SC emphasized that issues of ownership are not involved in a forcible entry case, except to determine the issue of possession (citing *Habagat Grill v. DMC-Urban Property Developer, Inc.*).
*   **Alternative Remedy:** Lacaba's remedy lies in filing an appropriate action to recover ownership.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Lacaba:** Failed to prove prior physical possession, leading to dismissal of his forcible entry claim. No legal obligation for De Grano to vacate the property as a result of the forcible entry claim.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Tax Declarations:** The case highlights the limitations of relying solely on tax declarations to prove possession. Other evidence is needed to establish actual physical possession.
*   **Proof of Tenancy:** Failure to adequately prove a landlord-tenant relationship can undermine a claim of prior possession based on a tenant's occupation.
*   **Timeliness of Appeals:** Failure to strictly comply with procedural rules regarding the timeliness of appeals can result in dismissal, regardless of the merits of the case.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rules of Court (implied, regarding procedure and timeliness)

*   *Ganila v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 150755 (tax declarations as indicia of possession)
*   *Tirona v. Alejo*, 419 Phil. 285 (2001) (possession *de facto* vs. *de jure*)
*   *Habagat Grill v. DMC-Urban Property Developer, Inc.*, G.R. No. 155110 (ownership not at issue)
