**Legal Document Summary: *David v. Court of Appeals***

**Case:** G.R. Nos. 111168-69

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Date:** June 17, 1998

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming convictions for Homicide and Frustrated Homicide.

**Facts:**
*   Joaquin David was convicted of Homicide (for the death of Noel Nora) and Frustrated Homicide (for the injury of Narciso Nora, Jr.) stemming from a shooting incident on March 28, 1981.
*   David claimed self-defense, alleging that the Nora brothers and companions attacked him.
*   RTC convicted, CA affirmed with sentence modifications.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Self-Defense (Art. 11 RPC):** The central issue is David's claim of self-defense. The Court of Appeals (CA) rejected this claim, finding that the unlawful aggression had ceased when David retreated to his house and then re-engaged armed with a gun. The SC upheld this ruling stating since he was inside his home, the unlawful aggression had already ceased. Referencing *People v. Macariola, 120 SCRA 92*,  the Court highlighted that aggression must be immediate to warrant self-defense. *Castanares v. Court of Appeals, 92 SCRA 567* was referenced to emphasize that the accused bears the burden of proving self-defense clearly and convincingly.
*   **Locus of the Crime:** The location of the shooting (outside David's compound) was deemed critical in determining the existence of unlawful aggression.  Contradictory testimonies concerning two compounds, one larger that contained the smaller family compound, were dismissed as a distraction.
*   **Retaliation vs. Self-Defense:** The Court explicitly stated that David's actions constituted retaliation, not self-defense, as the aggression had ceased, and David's acts were vengeful.  Citing US v. Ferrer, 1 Phil. 56, for its rule that the act of aggression must be followed immediately for it to be considered self-defense.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The Court granted the mitigating circumstance of **immediate vindication of a grave offense** (Art. 13, par. 5 RPC) due to the beating David suffered. Voluntary surrender was already credited by the CA. The court also granted David minority as a mitigating circumstance. 
*   **Privileged Mitigating Circumstance of Minority:** The Court recognized David's minority (17 years old at the time of the crime) based on his police statement and testimony from his mother. This invokes Art. 68 RPC, reducing the penalty by one degree. The court referenced *United States v. Bergantino, 3 Phil. 118*; *United States v. Barbicho, 13 Phil. 616, 621*; *United States v. Agadas, 36 Phil. 246* in support of its decision to resolve doubt on David's age in his favor.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Court deferred to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, highlighting the opportunity to observe demeanor. Referencing *People v. Cabiles, 248 SCRA 207 (1995).*

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for Homicide and Frustrated Homicide (reduced penalties due to mitigating circumstances, including minority).
*   Civil liability to the heirs of Noel Nora for death indemnity (increased to P50,000), actual damages (reduced to P22,000), moral damages (P30,000), and attorney's fees (P20,000).
*   Civil liability to Narciso Nora, Jr. for actual damages (reduced to P1,928.65) and moral damages (P20,000).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The core dispute revolves around the facts, specifically whether unlawful aggression continued up to the shooting. The Court clearly preferred the prosecution's version.
*   **Application of Mitigating Circumstances:** While the court granted certain mitigating circumstances, the defense argued for more. There is room for argument on whether the accepted mitigating circumstances were sufficiently weighed.
*   **Damages Assessment:** Though the court modified damage awards based on evidence, challenges to these amounts, though unlikely to prevail, could be raised if new evidence emerges.

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC): Art. 11 (Self-Defense), Art. 13 (Mitigating Circumstances), Art. 64 (Rules for Application of Penalties), Art. 68 (Penalty to be Imposed When the Offender is Under Eighteen Years of Age), Art. 249 (Homicide), Art. 50 (Frustrated Homicide).
