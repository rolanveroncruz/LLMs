## Legal Document Summary: Cambridge Realty vs. Eridanus Development & Chiton Realty (G.R. No. 152445)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding an overlapping of real property titles.

**Core Issue:** Whether CAMBRIDGE's property encroaches on ERIDANUS and CHITON's properties.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Ownership Claims:** CAMBRIDGE claims ownership of Lot 9,992 sq.m. under TCT 367213 derived from OCT 355. ERIDANUS claims ownership of Lot 2,794 sq.m. under TCT RT-38481 derived from OCT 362. CHITON claims ownership of Lot 2,563 sq.m. under TCT 12667 derived from OCT 362.
*   **Dispute Trigger:** Respondents ERIDANUS and CHITON filed suits to enjoin CAMBRIDGE's development, alleging encroachment.
*   **Survey Discrepancies:** Conflicting survey results regarding property boundaries and overlap, especially concerning the tie points and technical descriptions in the titles. The shift from PLS monuments to BLLM 1 is a significant point of contention.
*   **Reliance on Expert Testimony:** Heavy reliance on expert testimony from geodetic engineers, with conflicting opinions on the validity and accuracy of the surveys.
*   **Role of Government Surveyors:** The DENR conducted a relocation survey, but its report was considered incomplete and the court failed to properly secure their services.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Supreme Court finds that ERIDANUS and CHITON failed to meet their burden of proving encroachment.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The original trial court held the Respondents liable for attorney's fees of P50,000.00, reversed by CA, affirmed by Supreme Court.
*   The CA decision ordered the case remanded for determination of remedies under Art. 448 of the New Civil Code, in the event of encroachment. This was reversed by the Supreme Court.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguous Titles:** ERIDANUS and CHITON titles have irregularities, including incomplete information about the original registration.
*   **Floating Tie Point:** The original tie point for ERIDANUS and CHITON properties based on PLS monuments, deemed unreliable.
*   **Technical Overlapping:** The claim by the DENR surveyor that the overlapping is "technical," rather than a physical encroachment.
*   **Incomplete Records:** Missing subdivision plans and unavailable research data (Lot 27-C, Psd-13458 for TCT No. 18250, and Psd-13-005784 for TCT No. 367213).
*   **Historical Acquiescence:** The existence of an old adobe wall on the allegedly encroached portion, without prior complaints from previous owners, weakens the claim of encroachment.
*   **Proof that CAMBRIDGE's Title is Derived from TCT 578** It was not established, as a result, changing the boundary does not establish encroachment.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Act 496 (The Land Registration Act) (now PD 1529):** Governs the original registration of the properties.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Sec. 48 emphasizes the indefeasibility of Torrens titles and prohibits collateral attacks.
*   **Art. 448 of the New Civil Code:** Discusses the rights and obligations when a building or improvements are made on land owned by another. Referenced in the CA decision (reversed).
*   **Manual for Land Surveys in the Philippines:** Section 36 outlines acceptable reference points, criticizing the use of PLS monuments. Section 760 mandates the use of BLLM No. 1 as the tie point for cadastral lots.
*   **Goloy v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 47491, May 4, 1989, 173 SCRA 26.** landowner cannot claim property encroached upon when predecessor did not register objection.
*   **Director of Lands v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-45168, September 25, 1979, 93 SCRA 238.** Facts must be proven with rigid test of accuracy and authenticity.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The technical descriptions of the properties and the interpretation of survey results are highly contentious.
*   The definition and implications of "technical overlapping."
*   Whether the change in bearings caused encroachment.
*   The accuracy and reliability of Nerit's 1990 survey compared to his 1960 survey.
*   Whether the CAMBRIDGE title is derived from TCT 578.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, finding that ERIDANUS and CHITON failed to prove that CAMBRIDGE's property encroached on their lands. The court emphasized the need for a reliable verification survey, questioned the validity of the respondents' surveys due to the use of a floating tie point, found the DENR report insufficient, and highlighted the absence of prior complaints about the adobe wall. The SC stresses the need to maintain the integrity of the Torrens system and direct attacks on the titles need to be made in direct proceedings.
