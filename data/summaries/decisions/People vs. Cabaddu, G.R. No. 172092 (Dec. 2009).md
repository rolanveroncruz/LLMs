**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Joey Tion y Cabaddu* (G.R. No. 172092, December 16, 2009)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Joey Tion y Cabaddu for violation of Section 4, Article II of RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act), as amended, for selling 5.2 kilos of marijuana. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision finding Joey guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The core issues were: (1) validity of the buy-bust operation and (2) whether Joey's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt. The Court held that the buy-bust operation was valid, and the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to prove Joey's guilt.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 4, Article II of RA 6425, as amended:** Prohibits the sale, administration, delivery, distribution, and transportation of prohibited drugs.
*   **Reclusion Perpetua and Fine:** The penalty imposed, as per RA 6425, as amended by RA 7659, for selling over 750 grams of marijuana.

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused:** To refrain from selling, administering, delivering, distributing, or transporting prohibited drugs.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Joey Tion y Cabaddu:** Found guilty of violating Section 4, Article II of RA 6425, as amended, and sentenced to reclusion perpetua and a fine of PhP 500,000.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense of Instigation:** The defense argued instigation, claiming Joey was merely an "errand boy." The Court rejected this, finding the evidence supported a valid buy-bust operation, citing *People v. Doria* (G.R. No. 125299, January 22, 1999) to emphasize the "objective" test for scrutinizing buy-bust operations.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Joey contended that the submission and examination of the marijuana was barred by prescription and in violation of Sec. 21(2) and (3) of RA 9165, which requires the submission and examination of the specimens within 24 hours from confiscation, and the examination report under oath. The Court rejected the argument, noting RA 9165 was enacted after the crime occurred, and the existing chain of custody was proven to be intact.
*   **Entrapment vs. Instigation:** The Court distinguishes between entrapment (permissible) and instigation (not permissible) and concludes that Joey was entrapped, not instigated, citing *People v. Jocson* (G.R. No. 169875, December 18, 2007) regarding where criminal intent originates.
*   **Marked Money:** Joey argued the marked money was planted. The Court held that presentation of marked money is not essential for proving the sale of illegal drugs, it is only corroborative evidence.
*   **Definition of "Indian Hemp":** Joey questioned whether "Philippine Cannavissativa" (marijuana) falls under the definition of "Indian hemp" as a prohibited drug. The Court cited Sec. 2(e) and (i) of RA 6425, as amended, clarifying that it does.
*   **Retroactive Application of RA 9165:** Joey's invocation of RA 9165 provisions on chain of custody was rejected because the law was enacted after the commission of the crime.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act):** Primary statute violated.
*   **RA 7659:** Amended RA 6425, related to penalties.
*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Invoked by the defense, but not applicable retroactively.
*   **People v. Doria (G.R. No. 125299, January 22, 1999):** Established the "objective" test for buy-bust operations.
*   **People v. Jocson (G.R. No. 169875, December 18, 2007):** Distinguishes between entrapment and instigation.
*   **People v. Mateo (G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 7, 2004):** Pertains to transfer of case to CA.

**Conclusion:**

The case appears strong against the accused. The court relied heavily on the testimonies of police officers and discounted the defense of instigation. The chain of custody for the marijuana was properly established. The decision of the Supreme Court is *in toto* meaning the entire judgement of the lower courts was affirmed. There are no apparent ambiguous or contentious clauses.
