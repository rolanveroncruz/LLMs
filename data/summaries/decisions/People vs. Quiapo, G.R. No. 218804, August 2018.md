**Analysis for Lawyer:**

This case confirms the established principle that the date of the commission of rape is not an essential element of the crime of rape, and any discrepancy regarding the dates, place and time of the incidents deserves scant consideration. The defense attempted to discredit the victims based on inconsistent testimony on time and place. Despite the alibi put forward, the court gave more weight to the positive identification by the victims. The decision also reinforces the principle of affirmative testimony outweighing denial. The modification of damages follows recent jurisprudence and reflects the current standards for awards in rape cases. However, the fact that, if there were no defects in the information charging the appellant of rape, he can only be made liable for simple rape even if it was proven during trial that AAA was under twelve (12) years old at the time of the commission of the crimes charged, is a contention to note of.
