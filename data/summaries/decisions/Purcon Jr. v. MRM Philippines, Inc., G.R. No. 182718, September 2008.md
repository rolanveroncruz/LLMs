**Case Summary: *Julio B. Purcon, Jr. vs. MRM Philippines, Inc. and Miguel L. Rivera/Maritime Resources Management*** (G.R. No. 182718, September 26, 2008)

**Nature of Document:** Resolution on a Petition for Relief from Judgment filed under Rule 38 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.

**Key Issue:** Whether a Petition for Relief from Judgment is a proper remedy to set aside a Supreme Court Resolution denying a Petition for Review.

**Ruling:** No. The Supreme Court held that a Petition for Relief from Judgment is *not* an available remedy in the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals.

**Reasoning & Legal Basis:**

*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** Rule 38 specifies "any court," but this is interpreted in conjunction with Rule 56, which lists cases originally cognizable by the Supreme Court. A Petition for Relief from Judgment is not included in Rule 56. *Dela Cruz v. Andres, G.R. No. 161864, April 27, 2007, 522 SCRA 585* and *Mesina v. Meer, G.R. No. 146845, July 2, 2002, 383 SCRA 625* are cited to support this.

*   **Procedural Limitations:** Rule 38 contemplates filing the petition in the *same court* that rendered the original judgment. This is infeasible and illogical in the Supreme Court.

*   **Scope of Rule 38:**  The phrase "any court" in Rule 38 is limited to Municipal/Metropolitan and Regional Trial Courts, aligning with Rule 5 and RA 7691 which prescribe uniform procedures and designates Municipal/Metropolitan Trial Courts as courts of record.

*   **Appellate Procedure:** The Rules of Court and the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals (Rules 44-56) do not provide for a Petition for Relief from Judgment. Available remedies in the CA include annulment of judgments (Rule 47), motions for reconsideration (Rule 52), and new trial (Rule 53).

*   **Supreme Court Jurisdiction:** The Supreme Court primarily entertains questions of law, while a Petition for Relief raises factual issues such as fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence.

**Underlying Case Facts:**

*   Purcon filed a labor complaint against MRM Philippines, Inc. for reimbursement of medical expenses and disability benefits, claiming a work-related illness (hernia and later Epididymitis).

*   The Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint, finding Purcon fit to work and noting a signed Quitclaim and Release.

*   The NLRC affirmed the Labor Arbiter.

*   The Court of Appeals dismissed Purcon's Petition for Certiorari due to formal infirmities.

*   Purcon's Petition for Review on Certiorari to the Supreme Court was denied due to late filing, defective verification, failure to pay docket fees and failure to show any reversible error.

*   Purcon then filed the Petition for Relief from Judgment.

**Petitioner's Argument:**

*   Labor Arbiter and NLRC committed "gross mistake" in relying on the company physician's certification and the Quitclaim.
*   Counsel's "gross mistake" in filing defective pleadings prejudiced Purcon.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Estoppel:**  Purcon's signing of a Quitclaim and Release is a significant obstacle.
*   **Finality of Judgment:** The case has already been decided at multiple levels and has reached finality. Reopening the case would contravene public policy.
*   **Negligence vs. Gross Negligence:** The Court emphasizes that counsel's ordinary negligence is insufficient for relief. Clear abandonment of the client's cause must be demonstrated, citing *Espinosa v. Yatco, G.R. No. L-16435, January 31, 1963, 7 SCRA 78*.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "any court" in Rule 38 is the central point of contention. The Court restricts its meaning based on the overall structure of the Rules of Court.
*   Whether the late filing of the petition for review constitutes "excusable negligence" which also ties to the issue of the negligence and inefficiency of petitionerâ€™s counsel.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 38, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure
*   Rule 45, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure
*   Rule 56, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure
*   Republic Act No. 7691

**Case Law References:**

*   *Dela Cruz v. Andres, G.R. No. 161864, April 27, 2007, 522 SCRA 585*
*   *Mesina v. Meer, G.R. No. 146845, July 2, 2002, 383 SCRA 625*
*   *Espinosa v. Yatco, G.R. No. L-16435, January 31, 1963, 7 SCRA 78*

**Conclusion:** The petition was dismissed. The Supreme Court definitively states that a Petition for Relief from Judgment is not a valid remedy in either the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.
