## Legal Document Summary: *Canillo v. Angeles* (A.C. Nos. 9899, 9900-9905)

**Nature:** Consolidated disbarment proceedings against Atty. Sergio F. Angeles.

**Ruling:** Atty. Angeles found guilty of multiple violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility and DISBARRED.

**Key Provisions & Violations:**

*   **A.C. No. 9899 (Canillo):** Violation of Rule 18.03 (Neglect of a legal matter). Failure to file a required reply with the Supreme Court led to dismissal of the client's petition (G.R. No. 153138). *Case Law:* Cites settled jurisprudence on a lawyer's duty of diligence (e.g., *Ramos v. Jacoba*).

*   **A.C. No. 9900 (Dr. Malvar):** Violation of Rule 15.03 (Conflict of Interest). Represented conflicting interests by representing both Dr. Malvar in multiple cases and the Lopezes in land disputes involving Dr. Malvar. Directly adverse interests are representing a party seeking to invalidate agreements he prepared while enjoying Dr. Malvar's confidence. *Case Law:* Cites *Mabini Colleges, Inc. v. Pajarillo* regarding the prohibition on conflict of interest involving former clients.

*   **A.C. Nos. 9901 & 9902 (Hizons):** Violation of Rule 16.04 (Champerty). Entered into a champertous contract with Angelina Hizon where Atty. Angeles agreed to pay all costs to secure title in exchange for land. *Case Law:* Cites *Roxas v. Republic Real Estate Corporation* regarding the definition and illegality of champertous contracts.

*   **A.C. Nos. 9903-9905 (Dr. Malvar):** Violations of Rules 1.01 (Unlawful/Deceitful Conduct), 16.01 (Accounting for Client Funds), and Canon 17 (Fidelity to Client). Failed to account for significant sums of money received from Dr. Malvar for various transactions (Tandang Sora property purchase, Canillo property purchase, docket fees). Facilitated dubious transactions, including selling property he didn't own and facilitating a champertous contract.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Duty of diligence to clients.
*   Duty to avoid conflicts of interest.
*   Duty to maintain client confidences.
*   Duty to account for client funds and property.
*   Duty to avoid unlawful, dishonest, and deceitful conduct.
*   Duty of fidelity to the client's cause and maintain trust.

**Liabilities Incurred:**

*   Disbarment due to multiple and serious violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Court heavily relies on factual findings and documentary evidence (checks, receipts, agreements).
*   Respondent's defenses (e.g., void contracts, no-refund clauses, reliance on third parties) are rejected as inadequate to excuse his ethical breaches.
*   The extensive financial dealings and personal relationships between Atty. Angeles and Dr. Malvar created an environment ripe for conflicts of interest and potential abuse.
*   The champertous contract is a clear violation of public policy and severely undermines the attorney-client relationship.

**Statutory References:**

*   Code of Professional Responsibility: Rules 1.01, 15.03, 16.01, 16.04, and 18.03, Canon 17

**Overall Assessment:**

The court found a pattern of unethical conduct by Atty. Angeles demonstrating a disregard for his professional responsibilities, client interests, and the integrity of the legal profession, thus justifying the severe sanction of disbarment.
