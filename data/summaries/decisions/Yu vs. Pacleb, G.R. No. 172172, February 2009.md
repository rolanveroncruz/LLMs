## Legal Document Summary: *Sps. Ernesto V. Yu and Elsie Ong Yu vs. Baltazar N. Pacleb* (G.R. No. 172172)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision reversing the RTC's ruling. The case revolves around a dispute over ownership of a parcel of land (Langcaan Property) based on a series of unregistered conveyances.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Yu spouses are innocent purchasers for value in good faith and whether the decision in Civil Case No. 741-93 validly vested ownership in them.

**Facts:**

*   Pacleb was the registered owner of the Langcaan Property (TCT No. T-118375).
*   A series of unregistered conveyances occurred: Pacleb to Del Rosario (Deed of Absolute Sale dated Feb 27, 1992), Del Rosario to Javier (Deed of Absolute Sale dated May 7, 1992), and Javier to Yu spouses (Contract to Sell dated Nov 10, 1992).
*   Yu spouses filed Civil Case No. 741-93 against Javier for specific performance, seeking ownership and possession. Javier defaulted, and the RTC ruled in favor of the Yu spouses, ordering delivery of title upon payment of the remaining balance. This decision was annotated on Pacleb's TCT.
*   Pacleb filed Civil Case No. 1199-95 to annul the initial deed of sale to Del Rosario, alleging forgery. This case was dismissed *without prejudice* due to the inability to serve summons on Del Rosario.
*   Yu spouses filed a forcible entry action against Pacleb, which was initially successful but ultimately reversed by the CA, finding that Pacleb had prior physical possession.
*   Pacleb then filed the present case for removal of cloud from title, seeking cancellation of the annotation of the Civil Case No. 741-93 judgment.
*   RTC initially ruled for the Yu spouses as good faith purchasers. The CA reversed.

**Court of Appeals Ruling:**

*   The Yu spouses were *not* good faith purchasers, as several factors should have put them on notice of potential issues with Javier's title (unregistered conveyances, possession by Pacleb's son, Ramon).
*   Civil Case No. 741-93 was an action *in personam* and therefore not binding on Pacleb, who was not a party.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

*   Affirmed the CA decision.
*   Agreed that the Yu spouses were not innocent purchasers for value in good faith due to inconsistencies in their testimony and red flags surrounding the transfers of title.
*   Confirmed that Civil Case No. 741-93 was an action *in personam* and not binding on Pacleb because the aim and purpose of action determine its character. In accordance with the Cabutihan v. Landcenter Construction and Development Corporation [432 Phil. 927 (2002)] ruling, an action for specific performance praying for the execution of a deed of sale in connection with an undertaking in a contract, such as the contract to sell, in this instance, is an action *in personam.*
*   Reiterated the principle that a higher degree of prudence is required when purchasing from someone who is not the registered owner, citing *Revilla and Fajardo v. Galindez*, 107 Phil. 480, 485 (1960).
*   Reiterated the Domagas v. Jensen, G.R. No. 158407, January 17, 2005, 448 SCRA 663, 673-674 ruling about the distinction between actions *in personam* and actions *quasi in rem*.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Contract to Sell:** Created an obligation for Javier to convey title to the Yu spouses upon full payment. This obligation remained with Javier personally and did not burden the Langcaan Property.
*   **Good Faith Purchaser:** The Yu spouses' failure to conduct adequate due diligence and their awareness of potential issues surrounding Javier's title negated their claim as good faith purchasers, leaving them vulnerable to Pacleb's claim as the registered owner.
*   **Specific Performance:** The ruling in Civil Case No. 741-93 only binds Javier and does not transfer ownership from Pacleb to the Yu spouses.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Unregistered Conveyances:** The series of unregistered conveyances created a significant risk for the Yu spouses. Had the original deed been considered forged, Yu spouses face challenges in establishing title.
*   **Dismissal Without Prejudice:** The dismissal of Pacleb's annulment case *without prejudice* did not validate the questionable conveyances or estop Pacleb from asserting his ownership.
*   **Conflicting Testimony:** Discrepancies in Ernesto Yu's testimony regarding when he learned of Ramon's tenancy weakened his claim of good faith.
*   **Ramon Pacleb as Caretaker/Tenant:** The status of Ramon Pacleb (son of the registered owner) on the property (caretaker vs. tenant) as the CA noted, the failure to contact Ramon's wife to inquire about Ramon's role, coupled with the inconsistent information given was a serious error on behalf of the Yu spouses.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Domagas v. Jensen:** Defines and distinguishes between actions *in personam* and *quasi in rem*.
*   **Revilla and Fajardo v. Galindez:** Establishes a higher standard of diligence for purchasers buying from someone who is not the registered owner.
*   **Cabutihan v. Landcenter Construction and Development Corporation** Defines that an action for specific performance praying for the execution of a deed of sale in connection with an undertaking in a contract, such as the contract to sell, is an action *in personam.*

**Conclusion:**

The Yu spouses lost their claim to the Langcaan Property because they failed to act as good faith purchasers and relied on a judgment *in personam* against Javier. Pacleb, as the registered owner, has a superior right to the property.
