## Summary of A.M. No. P-98-1279: Panuncio vs. Icaro-Velasco

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative matter concerning a Branch Clerk of Court, Atty. Minerva Icaro-Velasco, charged with misfeasance of office.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Complainant Rosario Panuncio alleges she was arrested and detained based on an expired order of arrest. The Respondent, Atty. Icaro-Velasco, allegedly provided NBI agents a *xerox copy* of the arrest order *without verifying the status* of the case, specifically that it had been recalled.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Respondent claims she verified the authenticity of the *xerox* copy with her subordinate, Oscar Espiritu, and that the NBI agents pressured her to certify it. She maintains she told the NBI agent (Callueng) that the certification was only for authenticity.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) recommended severe reprimand, finding the Respondent remiss in her duty.
*   **Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court adopted the OCA's recommendation and severely reprimanded Atty. Icaro-Velasco.

**Obligations:**

*   **Branch Clerk of Court's Duty:** The Respondent had a duty to maintain the authenticity of court records and uphold public confidence in the administration of justice.  This includes verifying the current status of court orders before releasing copies.
*   **Supervisory Duty:** The Respondent, as Branch Clerk of Court, is responsible for the actions and shortcomings of subordinate employees.

**Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Icaro-Velasco found liable for misfeasance, specifically a lack of circumspection in performing her duties.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Expired Order of Arrest:** The core risk lies in relying on an expired order of arrest. The Branch Clerk had a duty to clarify that an older warrant was no longer valid.
*   **Certification of Xerox Copy:**  The certification of a *xerox copy* without clearly indicating the order's recalled status created ambiguity and facilitated the wrongful arrest.
*   **Blame Shifting:** Respondent's attempt to shift blame to her subordinate, Espiritu, was rejected based on the established jurisprudence.
*   **Case Law:** Cites *Yaranon v. Rulloda, 242 SCRA 522*, establishing a Branch Clerk's responsibility for subordinate employees.

**Statutory References:**

*   While the initial complaint included allegations of violating R.A. No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees) against the NBI agents, these were dismissed.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The claim that the Respondent only certified the *xerox copy* for authenticity and informed the NBI agents that it was only for authenticity is questionable, as it failed to clearly indicate the order had been recalled. This is the crux of the finding of misfeasance.
