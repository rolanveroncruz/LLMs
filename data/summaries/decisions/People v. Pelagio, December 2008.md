## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Pelagio*

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Rogelio Pelagio y Bermudo*, G.R. No. 173052, December 16, 2008.

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of the accused for three counts of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) as amended by R.A. 7659 and R.A. 7610, committed against his 15-year-old daughter.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charges:** Three counts of rape by the accused against his daughter, AAA, filed under separate Informations (Crim. Case Nos. 98-7037, 98-7038, 98-7142).
*   **Defense:** Denial and claim of instigation by the accused's estranged wife.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty on all counts, imposing the death penalty for each offense and awarding damages.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed conviction with modification on damages.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed CA Decision with modifications on the amount of damages awarded.

**Key Issues:**

*   **Credibility of the Victim (AAA):** The court emphasized the importance of credibility in rape cases. The SC relied on existing case law such as *People v. Maglente* and *People v. Andales*, supporting giving more weight to the credibility of a victim due to her youth and inmaturity.
*   **Defense of Denial:** The SC reiterated that denial is a weak defense and cannot outweigh the positive testimony of the victim.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** The SC acknowledged that the delay in reporting the rape did not automatically impair the credibility of the witness.
*   **Lack of Medical Evidence:** The court affirmed the admissibility of the victim's testimony even without medical evidence of rape, citing *Llave v. People* and *People v. Juntilla*, reiterating that penetration, not necessarily emission, is the crucial factor.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The court ruled that the death penalty was properly imposed as per Article 266-B of the RPC because the crime of rape was committed with the aggravating circumstance of the victim being under 18 years of age and the offender being her parent, citing *People v. Tinsay*.
*   **Retroactive effect of Republic Act No. 9346:** While the original sentence was death for each count, the SC applied R.A. 9346 retroactively, reducing the penalty to reclusion perpetua per count.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused is obligated to serve reclusion perpetua for each of the three counts of rape.
*   Accused is ordered to pay the private complainant AAA P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages, for each count of rape or a total of P525,000.00.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for rape.
*   Civil liability for damages (civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages) to the victim.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   While the conviction is affirmed, future attempts to challenge the factual findings based on the credibility of witnesses remain a theoretical possibility, albeit unlikely given the strong precedent.
