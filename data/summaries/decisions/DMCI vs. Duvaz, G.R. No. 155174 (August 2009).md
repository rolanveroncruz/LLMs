**Legal Document Summary: D.M. Consunji, Inc. v. Duvaz Corporation, G.R. No. 155174**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of CA decision denying DMCI's petition for certiorari against RTC's denial of its Motion for Summary Judgment.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Construction Contract No. AP-CC-A-0007:** DMCI contracted to build substructure/foundation for Duvaz's Alfaro's Peak building.
*   **Completion and Defect Liability:** Project completed October 31, 1997; defect liability period ended October 31, 1998.
*   **Duvaz's SEC Petition:** Duvaz filed for suspension of payments with the SEC listing DMCI as a creditor for PhP 29,209,735.85 (SEC Case No. 12-97-5850).
*   **Contractor's Lien:** DMCI filed for annotation of contractor's lien on TCT No. 200089 (LRC No. M-3839). RTC ordered annotation of lien for PhP 29,209,735.85.
*   **DMCI's Collection Suit:** DMCI filed suit against Duvaz for PhP 38,765,956.53 plus interest (Civil Case No. 99-1354).
*   **Duvaz's Counterclaims:** Duvaz asserted counterclaims alleging serious defects in the substructure of both Alfaro's Peak and the Peak (constructed earlier by DMCI), seeking damages for rectification works and related costs.

**Obligations:**

*   DMCI: To construct the substructure per the contract and warranty against hidden defects.
*   Duvaz: To pay DMCI for services rendered under the contract.

**Liabilities:**

*   **DMCI:** Potentially liable for defects in the substructure and damages arising from alleged mal-execution of construction works, particularly related to the encroachment issues and water damage affecting both buildings.
*   **Duvaz:** Potentially liable for the outstanding balance of the contract price, subject to validation against DMCI’s claims.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Genuine Issues of Material Fact:** The existence of genuine issues of material fact precludes summary judgment, necessitating a full trial. These include the nature and extent of defects, causation, and the validity of DMCI's claim.
*   **Prescription:** Duvaz argued that DMCI's counterclaims have already prescribed due to the lapse of the defect liability period. However, SC determined that some of Duvaz's claims are related to property damage caused by faulty rectification works, which fall outside warranty concerns.
*   **Estoppel:** DMCI argued that Duvaz is estopped from denying its liability, based on admissions in prior proceedings. The Court, however, rejected this argument, finding that Duvaz’s denials in its Answer in Civil Case No. 99-1354 diluted any previous admissions.
*   **Res Judicata:** DMCI's argument that the order in LRC Case No. M-3839 has res judicata effect was rejected due to a lack of identity of rights asserted or causes of action and identity of relief sought.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 35, Sections 1 and 3 of the Rules of Court:** Pertaining to summary judgment.
*   **Solidbank Corp. v. CA, G.R. No. 120010, October 3, 2002, 390 SCRA 241:** Defines summary judgment and its applicability.
*   **Asian Construction and Development Corporation v. Philippine Commercial Industrial Bank, G.R. No. 153827, April 25, 2006, 488 SCRA 192:** Elaborates on the concept of "genuine issue".

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The exact amount owed by Duvaz to DMCI is disputed, with differing figures presented in various documents.
*   The cause and extent of defects and water seepage issues and their connection to DMCI's construction and rectification work on both buildings are contentious.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of summary judgment, remanding the case for trial. The existence of genuine issues regarding the amount owed, the extent and cause of the construction defects, and the viability of Duvaz’s counterclaims necessitates a full presentation of evidence.
