## Legal Document Summary: Lumayna vs. Commission on Audit (G.R. No. 185001, September 25, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 assailing COA Decisions disallowing a 5% salary increase for municipal personnel of Mayoyao, Ifugao, and ordering refund.

**Key Issue:** Whether COA committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the disallowance of the salary increase and ordering petitioners to refund the amount.

**Facts:**

*   **Background:** Municipality of Mayoyao granted a 5% salary increase to its personnel via Resolutions 66 and 94, s. 2002, pursuant to DBM Local Budget Circular (LBC) No. 74 implementing RA 9137. Funds were realigned from previously allocated budget.
*   **COA Disallowance:** COA disallowed the increase (P895,891.50) based on Sections 325 and 326 of the Local Government Code (LGC), alleging the municipality exceeded personal services (PS) limitations and that a Sangguniang Bayan resolution was an inappropriate manner of granting the increase. COA based its findings on computations using rates from LBC No. 75, instead of LBC No. 74.
*   **Sangguniang Panlalawigan:** Initially disallowed the 5% salary increase but later reconsidered finding good faith on the part of the municipal officials.
*   **Petitioners:** The Municipal Mayor, Budget Officer, Municipal Accountant and SB Members who approved Resolutions 66 and 94, s. 2002.

**COA's Position:**

*   The Municipality exceeded the PS limitation under Section 325(a) of the LGC.
*   Adoption of a higher salary class schedule is not covered for PS waiver under LBC No. 75.
*   Resolution No. 2002-556 declaring budget as operative didn't include the salary increase contained in SB Resolution No. 66, series of 2002.

**Petitioners' Arguments:**

*   Resolutions 66 and 94 were valid exercises of legislative prerogative under LBC No. 74.
*   The municipality's budget for 2002 did not exceed PS limitations.
*   Realignment of funds did not increase the PS allocation as it involved existing PS funds for vacated/abolished positions.
*   COA wrongly relied on LBC No. 75, which had a clear effectivity clause exempting budgets already reviewed.
*   Petitioners acted in good faith, as recognized by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.

**Ruling:**

*   **Petition Partially Granted:** COA's disallowance of P895,891.50 was affirmed, as factual findings of administrative bodies are afforded great weight.
*   However, petitioners were **not** ordered to refund the disallowed amount because they acted in good faith, relying on the color of law, and were supported by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan's initial operative declaration of the 2002 municipal budget.  The Court relies on *Abanilla v. COA* (G.R. No. 142347), *Blaquera v. Alcala* (G.R. Nos. 109406, 110642, 111494, 112056 & 119597), among others, citing good faith exception from refund liability.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 325(a) of the LGC:** Limits total PS appropriations for local government units.
*   **LBC No. 74:** Authorizes a maximum of 5% salary adjustment for LGU personnel.
*   **LBC No. 75:** Provides guidelines on personal services limitations.
*   **Obligations:** Compliance with PS limitations under the LGC and relevant DBM circulars.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, petitioners were ordered to refund the disallowed amount.
*   *Holding:* Petitioners are not required to refund disallowed amount due to good faith.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Good Faith Determination:**  The determination of "good faith" is a fact-specific inquiry and can be subject to further litigation.
*   **Application of DBM Circulars:** The proper application of LBC No. 74 vs. LBC No. 75.  COA maintains LBC 69 was used for calculations instead of LBC 74.
*   **Realignment Sufficiency:** Whether the realignment of funds from the vacated positions was sufficient and properly documented to support the salary increase.
*   **PS Limitation Calculation:** The computation and interpretation of what constitutes "total annual income from regular sources" for determining the PS limitation.
*   **Retroactive Application:** The issue of whether the Sangguniang Bayan resolutions were given retroactive effect.
