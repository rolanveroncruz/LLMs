## Legal Document Summary: *Suarez v. Commission on Audit*, G.R. No. 131077 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing a COA Decision and Resolution holding Petitioner, Leonisa E. Suarez, jointly and severally liable for disallowed amounts in a contract related to the Cavite Export Processing Zone (CEPZ).

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Disallowance:** COA disallowed P1,179,719.59 due to a discrepancy between contract costs and COA Technical Services Office (TSO) estimates. The discrepancy stemmed from high transformer costs and VAT miscalculation in the Approved Agency Estimate (AAE).
*   **Liability Determination:** The COA held multiple EPZA officials, including Suarez, liable based on their involvement in the project, specifically as members of the Prequalification, Bids and Awards Committee (PBAC).
*   **Petitioner's Role:** Suarez's participation was limited to PBAC membership, involving bidding conduct, bid evaluation, and contract award recommendation. She had no part in preparing the Program of Work (POW) or AAE, which were the basis for the disallowance.
*   **Administrative Due Process:** The decision also violated Administrative Due process, as the COA decision did not contain substantial evidence to support the conclusion that Suarez was responsible for the disallowance.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court held that the COA failed to overcome the presumption that Suarez acted regularly in her official duty, as there was no evidence of bad faith, malice, or gross negligence, required under Sec. 29.2 of the Revised CSB Manual and Section 38, Chapter 9, Book I of the 1987 Administrative Code.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree 1445 (Government Auditing Code):** Section 103 establishes personal liability for unlawful expenditures on the official directly responsible.
*   **Revised CSB Manual:** Section 29.2 requires a clear showing of bad faith, malice, or gross negligence to hold a public officer civilly liable.
*   **1987 Administrative Code:** Book I, Chapter 9, Section 38 reiterates the same principle regarding the liability of public officers.
*   ***Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations*, 69 Phil. 635 (1940):** Outlines principles of administrative due process, including substantial evidence and independent consideration of facts.
*   **Fabella v. Court of Appeals, GR No. 110379, November 28, 1997** Reiterates the principles of Administrative Due Process

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The COA initially determined Suarez to be jointly and severally liable for the disallowed amount. However, the Supreme Court reversed this, exonerating her from liability.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The initial COA decision posed a significant financial risk to Suarez.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The COA's reasoning for holding Suarez liable while excluding other PBAC members (Villanueva and Adorable) lacked a clear, consistent basis, suggesting arbitrary application of liability.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the COA's decision, finding grave abuse of discretion. The Court emphasized that liability requires a direct link to the specific actions causing the disallowance (the flawed AAE). Since Suarez's role in the PBAC did not extend to the preparation or approval of the AAE, she could not be held responsible. The decision reinforces the need for substantial evidence and adherence to administrative due process in holding public officials liable for disallowed funds.
