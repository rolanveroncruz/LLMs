**Case Summary: *Superior Maintenance Services, Inc. v. Bermeo*, G.R. No. 203185, December 5, 2018**

**Key Issue:** Whether respondent Bermeo was constructively dismissed by petitioner Superior Maintenance Services, Inc.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) and reinstated the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) decision, finding that Bermeo was not constructively dismissed because the complaint was prematurely filed.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Floating Status/Off-Detail:** The SC clarified the application of "floating status" or temporary "off-detail" for employees of manpower agencies. This refers to the period between assignments. The SC applies Article 301 (formerly Article 286) of the Labor Code by analogy.
*   **Article 301, Labor Code:** While not directly applicable (as it addresses suspension of business operations), Article 301 is applied *by analogy* to limit the floating status to a maximum of six (6) months. After six months, the employer must either recall the employee or permanently retrench them per legal requirements.
*   **Constructive Dismissal:** Failure to recall or retrench after six months of floating status can constitute constructive dismissal.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Premature Filing:** The key risk identified is the *premature* filing of the complaint. Bermeo filed his complaint only one week after his last unsuccessful assignment at French Baker or at most, less than six months after the end of his assignment at Trinoma Mall. Therefore, Superior Maintenance was not yet obligated to recall or retrench him.
*   **Employer Obligation:** Employers have an obligation to provide assignments within a reasonable period (implicitly six months). Failure can lead to constructive dismissal claims.
*   **Separation Pay:** The CA initially ordered payment of separation pay, which the SC reversed. The NLRC had affirmed payment of 13th month pay, and the SC did not reverse this, implying ongoing liability for this payment.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Salvaloza v. NLRC, 650 Phil. 543 (2010):*** Defined temporary off-detail or floating status of security guards.
*   ***Veterans Security Agency, Inc., et al., v. Gonzalvo, Jr., 514 Phil. 488 (2005):*** The CA erroneously relied on *Veterans* in requiring a bona fide suspension of business operations to apply Article 301. The SC clarified that *Veterans* does not require suspension of business but simply the lack of available posts.
*   ***Philippine Industrial Security Agency Corporation v. Dapiton and the National Labor Relations Commission, 377 Phil. 951, 961-962 (1999); Ptdo v. National Labor Relations Commission, 545 Phil. 507, 515-516 (2007); Megaforce Security and Allied Services, Inc., v. Lactao and National Labor Relations Commission, 581 Phil. 100, 105-106 (2008); Leopard Security and Investigation Agency v. Quitoy, et al., 704 Phil. 449, 457-458 (2013).*** Supports the application by analogy to the rules under Article 301 (then Article 286) of the Labor Code.
*    ***Exocet Security and Allied Services Corporation v. Serrano, 744 Phil. 403, 412-413 (2014).*** Supports the application by analogy to the rules under Article 301 (then Article 286) of the Labor Code.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of Article 301 by analogy is inherently open to interpretation. The meaning of "reasonable time" within which an employer must provide work remains subject to interpretation on a case-by-case basis.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 301 (formerly Article 286), Labor Code:** Relating to the suspension of business operations, used by analogy.
