**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the Contract to Sell is valid and binding between the parties, despite the lack of probate court approval. The court reasoned that the Petitioner acted as an heir, not as an executrix/administratrix, when entering the contract. Consummation of the sale is subject to the testate proceedings, particularly payment and estate debts.
