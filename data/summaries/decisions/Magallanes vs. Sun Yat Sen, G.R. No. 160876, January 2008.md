**Case Summary: *Magallanes v. Sun Yat Sen Elementary School***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 160876, January 18, 2008 (566 Phil. 77)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Azucena Magallanes, Evelyn Bacolod, and Heirs of Judith Cotecson (former teachers)
*   **Respondents:** Sun Yat Sen Elementary School, Paz Go, Elena Cubillan, Willy Ang Gan Teng, Benito Ang, and Teotimo Tan (school representatives)

**Key Issue:** Whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in modifying the final and executory Decision of the Court of Appeals regarding the computation of backwages and separation pay for illegally dismissed teachers.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioners were illegally dismissed from Sun Yat Sen Elementary School.
*   Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of the petitioners, ordering reinstatement and payment of backwages, etc.
*   NLRC reversed the Labor Arbiter's decision, holding that the contracts lapsed.
*   Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the NLRC as to Magallanes, Bacolod, and Cotecson, ordering separation pay and backwages from the time of dismissal until the CA decision (October 28, 1999). This decision became final.
*   Labor Arbiter computed monetary awards accordingly.
*   NLRC, on appeal from the Labor Arbiter's computation, modified the award, limiting backwages up to June 20, 1995 only.
*   Petitioners' subsequent appeal to the CA was dismissed due to procedural error (incorrect case number on motion for reconsideration).

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court (SC) granted the petition, reversing the CA's dismissal of the procedural error, and setting aside the NLRC's modified computation. The SC reinstated the Labor Arbiter's original computation based on the CA's decision, which had become final and executory.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Establishes the school's liability for illegally dismissing the teachers.
*   **Backwages & Separation Pay:** Obligation of the school to pay backwages and separation pay as computed until October 28, 1999 (date of CA decision), not June 20, 1995 (as erroneously modified by the NLRC).
*   **Immutability of Judgments:** The NLRC cannot modify a final and executory judgment of the appellate court.

**Liabilities:**

*   The school is liable for backwages and separation pay to the petitioners, computed based on the CA decision until October 28, 1999.
*   The SC decision clarifies the immutability of final judgements from appellate courts

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement Proceedings:** The school faces immediate enforcement of the judgment and may face challenges in complying.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Governs employment rights and remedies for illegal dismissal.
*   **Manual of Regulations for Private Schools:**  Cited in the CA decision regarding the requirement of 3 years consecutive service for a permanent employee.
*   **Rules of Civil Procedure:** Cited regarding requirements for petitions and motions, particularly Section 1, Rule 65 and Section 3, Rule 46.
*   **Llantero v. Court of Appeals:** (G.R. No. 28421) Used as precedent regarding erroneous docket numbers rendering pleadings "non-existent."
*   **Mega Land Resources and Development Corporation v. C-E Construction Corporation:** (G.R. No. 156211) Another case on wrong docket numbers.
*   **Doctrine of Immutability of Judgments (Francisco v. Bautista, G.R. No. 44167):** A final and executory judgment is immutable and unalterable.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The dispute centered around the interpretation of the CA decisionâ€™s date of computation, particularly the phrase "up to the time of the promulgation of this decision". The NLRC interpreted it to mean until the initial Labor Arbiter decision, while the CA intended the CA decision date. This was resolved by the SC in favor of the petitioners.
*   The procedural error (wrong case number) highlights the importance of accuracy in legal filings, though the Supreme Court relaxed the rule.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   The principle of immutability of judgements of the appellate courts, is re-iterated and supported by existing jurisprudance.
