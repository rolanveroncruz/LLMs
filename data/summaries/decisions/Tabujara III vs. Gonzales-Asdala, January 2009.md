## Legal Document Summary: *A.M. No. RTJ-08-2126*

**Nature:** Disciplinary case against Judge Fatima Gonzales-Asdala for gross ignorance of the law and procedure, and gross misconduct.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Violation of RA 9262 and Habeas Corpus:** Related to proceedings involving a VAWC case, nullity of marriage, and habeas corpus petition, all involving the same parties (Atty. Tabujara and his wife).
*   **Interference with Co-Equal Court:** Judge Asdala, acting as pairing judge, amended an order issued by Judge Bay of a co-equal court *before* Judge Bay's official leave commenced. This is a violation of the principle against interference between courts of concurrent jurisdiction.
*   **Procedural Due Process Violation:** Judge Asdala acted on an *ex parte* motion filed by the wife without notice to Atty. Tabujara, in violation of Rule 15, Section 4 of the Rules of Court (regarding notice and hearing of motions).
*   **Abuse of Contempt Power:** Judge Asdala cited Atty. Tabujara for contempt and issued a bench warrant without affording him the opportunity to explain his non-compliance with the order to produce the child. This violates Rule 71 of the Rules of Court (Indirect Contempt).
* Violation of the Constitution

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Judge Asdala had an obligation to adhere to established rules of procedure, including due process requirements and respecting the jurisdiction of co-equal courts.
*   Judge Asdala is held liable for gross ignorance of the law and procedure, and gross misconduct.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contentious issue is whether Judge Asdala acted within her authority as a pairing judge. The Supreme Court concluded she did not, as Judge Bay was still presiding when she issued the amended order.
*   The *ex parte* nature of the motion and the speed with which Judge Asdala acted create potential grounds for arguing bias or partiality.
*   The application of contempt powers without proper process presents a significant due process concern.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 15, Section 4, Rules of Court:** Requires notice and hearing for litigated motions.
*   **Rule 71, Rules of Court:** Governs contempt proceedings, specifically requiring notice and an opportunity to be heard for indirect contempt.
*   **Lim v. Domagas, A.M. No. RTJ-92-899:**  Cited to support the finding of gross ignorance of the law when a judge declares contempt without a hearing.
*   **Edaño v. Asdala (previous case):** Details Judge Asdala's prior dismissal from service, impacting the penalty in this case.
* **RA 9262: Violence against women and children act**

**Ambiguities:**

*   The judge's rationale for acting with "undue haste" based on the urgency of the situation and whether that justified deviating from established procedures.

**Outcome:**

*   Judge Asdala found guilty of gross ignorance of the law and procedure.
*   Fined P40,000.00, deducted from funds previously withheld in *Edaño v. Asdala*.
*   Given her previous dismissal, further disciplinary action was limited to a fine.
