Okay, here's a legal summary of the case *Ayala Corporation vs. Ray Burton Development Corporation*, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Ayala Corporation vs. Ray Burton Development Corporation*, G.R. No. 126699, August 7, 1998.

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over deed restrictions imposed by Ayala Corporation (Ayala) on a lot purchased by Ray Burton Development Corporation (RBDC) in Makati City. Ayala sought specific performance or rescission of the sale due to RBDC’s construction of a 26-story building ("Trafalgar Plaza") exceeding the height restriction outlined in the original deed restrictions. The trial court ruled in favor of RBDC, a decision that the Court of Appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, finding that RBDC was bound by the original deed restrictions (modified by later CRDRs) and had acted in bad faith.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Deed Restrictions (Original):** Primarily, a 42-meter height restriction and a requirement to obtain Ayala's approval of building plans. Also, the sale stipulates that a breach of the restrictions allows Ayala the right to rescind the contract.
*   **Special Conditions:** Initial obligations for the vendee to obtain final approval from AYALA of building plans, and restricted the sale without building completion.
*   **"Consolidated and Revised Deed Restrictions" (CRDRs):** Later revised restrictions established "floor area ratios" (FARs), replacing direct height restrictions with floor area limits. (RBDC's consent to these was contested.)
*   **RBDC's Obligations:** To comply with the deed restrictions applicable to the property, to submit building plans for approval, and to build in accordance with approved plans. To pay development charges as computed under the provisions of the CRDR.
*   **Ayala's Obligations:** To act in good faith and enforce deed restrictions consistently.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   **RBDC's Liability:** Ultimately held liable for exceeding the floor area limits under the CRDR.
*   **Damages:** Because specific performance (demolition) was deemed infeasible due to building completion and tenant occupancy, RBDC was ordered to pay:
    *   Development charges as calculated under the current CRDRs.
    *   Exemplary damages of P2,500,000.00 (due to bad faith).
    *   Attorney's fees of P250,000.00.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Notice of Restrictions:** RBDC argued a lack of actual or constructive notice of the 42-meter height restriction. The Supreme Court refuted this, citing the annotation of the special conditions in prior deeds of sale and RBDC's submission of conforming plans initially.
*   **Estoppel Argument:** RBDC argued that Ayala was estopped from enforcing the restriction due to its alleged failure to enforce against other violators. The Supreme Court found this argument unpersuasive, holding that minor violations did not justify estoppel.
*   **Contract of Adhesion:** RBDC argued that the deed restrictions were a contract of adhesion. The Supreme Court acknowledged that even though restrictions were pre-printed and prepared by Ayala, RBDC’s president was a businessman of 30 years and had the ability to leave the agreement.
*   **Feasibility of Specific Performance:** The Supreme Court acknowledged that the current structure was now occupied.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Article 428 (property rights), Article 24 (protection of disadvantaged parties).
*   **Revised Rules of Court (now Rules of Civil Procedure):** Section 49, Rule 39 (effect of judgments - *res judicata*), now Sec. 47, Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1096 (National Building Code):** Though cited by RBDC, the Supreme Court held that compliance with the Building Code did not excuse violation of contractual deed restrictions.
*   **Case Law on Contracts of Adhesion:**  *Ong Yiu vs. Court of Appeals, et. al.*, 91 SCRA 223, 231 [1979], *Philippine American General Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Sweet Lines, Inc., et. al.*, 212 SCRA 194, 212-213 [1992], *Qua Chee Gan vs. Law Union and Rock Insurance Co., Ltd.*,98 Phil. 95 [1955].

**Ambiguities & Contentions:**

*   **Applicability of CRDRs to RBDC:** RBDC did not vote for the approval of the CRDRs.

**Overall Analysis:**

The Supreme Court favored enforcing contractual obligations (deed restrictions) despite RBDC's arguments of notice, estoppel, and contract of adhesion. It also highlighted RBDC's bad faith conduct through the double submission of construction plans. While specific performance was impractical, the Court imposed damages as a substitute, reflecting the financial burdens RBDC's over-construction placed on the property.
