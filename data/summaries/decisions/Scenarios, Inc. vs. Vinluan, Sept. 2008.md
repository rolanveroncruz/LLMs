Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision:

**Case:** *Scenarios, Inc. vs. Jelly Vinluan* (G.R. No. 173283, September 17, 2008)

**Summary:**

This case concerns an illegal dismissal complaint filed by respondent Vinluan against Scenarios, Inc. The core issue is whether Scenarios, Inc. was properly served with summons and notices during the labor proceedings, and therefore not denied due process. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, which reinstated the Labor Arbiter's ruling in favor of Vinluan.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Respondent Vinluan filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, underpayment of salaries, and nonpayment of benefits.
*   **Service of Summons & Notices (Secs. 5 & 6, Rule III, NLRC Rules of Procedure):** This outlines the procedure for serving notices, summons, and other legal documents in labor cases.  Service can be personal or by registered mail. Service by registered mail is complete after five (5) days from the date of the first notice of the postmaster if the addressee fails to claim the mail.
*   **Reinstatement and Backwages:** The Labor Arbiter initially ordered reinstatement of Vinluan with full backwages, which was eventually upheld.
*   **Appeal Period (Art. 223, Labor Code):** An appeal must be filed within ten (10) days from receipt of the decision.

**Liabilities:**

*   Scenarios, Inc. is liable for reinstatement of Vinluan with full backwages and other money claims. If reinstatement is not feasible, separation pay is required.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with the reinstatement order and payment of backwages could result in further legal action and penalties.
*   **Procedural Errors:** Challenges to the validity of service, even if unsuccessful, can prolong the litigation and increase legal costs.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Secs. 5 & 6, Rule III, NLRC Rules of Procedure (As amended By Resolution 3-99, Series of 1999):** Governs the service of notices and resolutions in NLRC cases. This is a critical reference point in determining the validity of service.
*   **Art. 223, Labor Code:** Pertains to the appeal period for labor cases.
*   **Columbus Philippines Bus Corporation v. NLRC, 417 Phil. 81, 96 (2001):**  Reinforces the rule that service by registered mail is complete after five days from the date of first notice.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** Courts presume regularity in official duty, including service of summons and notices. This presumption must be rebutted with competent evidence ( *Masagana Concrete Products v. NLRC, 372 Phil. 459, 472 (1999)*).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Validity of Service on "Jess Jimenez":**  Scenarios, Inc. argued that Jess Jimenez was a stranger to the company, rendering service invalid.  The Court acknowledged this point, but ruled it immaterial because the company name was on the envelope and because it was the company's responsiblity to ensure those employed received the notification..
*   **Denial of Receipt:** Scenarios, Inc. claimed non-receipt of notices. However, the postal certifications and the fact that notices were sent to the company's business address undermined this claim.
*  The return of the summons envelope marked "UNCLAIMED" and the postal certifications were considered sufficient proof of completed service, despite the company's denial of receipt.

**Legal Precision:**

The court emphasized the presumption of regularity in official duty and held that Scenarios, Inc. failed to rebut this presumption with sufficient evidence. The court applied a liberal interpretation of procedural rules in quasi-judicial proceedings, focusing on whether the service reasonably provided notice.
