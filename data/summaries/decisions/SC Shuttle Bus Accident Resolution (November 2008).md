**Case:** *Re: Vehicular Accident Involving SC Shuttle Bus No. 3...Gerry B. Moral* A.M. No. 2008-13-SC (2008)

**Nature:** Administrative Matter regarding potential disciplinary action (termination) against a Supreme Court shuttle bus driver following a vehicular accident.

**Facts:**

*   On July 7, 2008, a Supreme Court shuttle bus driven by Gerry B. Moral struck a public utility jeepney from behind, causing injuries to passengers and property damage. A subsequent chain reaction involved two other vehicles. One person later died.
*   Moral claimed brake malfunction as the cause, travelling approx 20-25 kph.
*   Conflicting employee statements exist regarding bus speed before the accident.
*   The Office of Administrative Services (OAS) initially concluded no negligence on Moral's part, attributing the accident to brake failure.
*   OAS then recommended Moral's termination based on loss of trust/confidence and his status as a casual employee.

**Key Provisions & Legal Issues:**

*   **Security of Tenure:** The central issue is whether Moral, as a *casual* government employee, could be terminated due to the accident. Cites *Sec. 2, Article IX (B) of the Constitution* & *Sec. 46 (a), Chapter 7 of the Civil Service Law.*
*   **Cause for Termination:** Termination of civil service employees requires "cause provided by law." Gross neglect of duty could be grounds for dismissal (*Sec. 22, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations*).
*   **Negligence:** OAS initially found "no fault or negligence" but later recommended termination citing loss of trust, despite initial findings.
*   **Fortuitous Event vs. Negligence:** The document addresses the argument that the brake malfunction constitutes a *force majeure*.
*   **Duty of Care:** The Court emphasizes the owner/driver's responsibility to maintain the vehicle. Cites *Thermochem Incorporated v. Naval* (G.R. No. 131541).
*   **Confidential Employee:** Addressed whether Moral can be terminated based on loss of trust and confidence.
*   **Civil Aeronautics Administration v. IAC (G.R. No. 70120)**: Protection against arbitrary dismissal applies even to temporary employees.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court **RETAINED** Gerry B. Moral as a shuttle bus driver until the end of his temporary employment contract (December 2008), absent cause for earlier dismissal.
*   The Court rejected OAS's recommendation for dismissal due to lack of evidence of gross negligence.
*   The Court disagreed with the OAS’s recommendation that Mr. Moral be dismissed based on loss of trust and confidence.
*   Court clarified that even a casual employee enjoys security of tenure and dismissal requires cause under Civil Service Rules.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflicting Evidence:** Discrepancies in employee statements (especially regarding speed) could be problematic if a civil suit arises or future disciplinary actions are pursued.
*   **OAS's Shifting Stance:** OAS's contradictory findings (initially no negligence, then recommending termination) undermine its credibility and raise potential due process concerns.
*   **Continued Employment Until End of Term:** While Moral was retained, the court indicated that Moral’s services would not be engaged after the termination of his employment contract, barring further action.
*   **Maintenance/Roadworthiness:** The Court emphasized the duty to maintain the vehicle. Future accidents stemming from similar mechanical issues could lead to harsher penalties and claims of *culpa in eligiendo* or *culpa in vigilando* against the employer (Supreme Court).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Civil Aeronautics Administration v. IAC* (G.R. No. 70120): Temporary employees still have protections against arbitrary dismissal.
*   *Thermochem Incorporated v. Naval* (G.R. No. 131541): Establishes the duty of care vehicle owners/drivers owe to third parties.
*   *Civil Service Commission v. Salas* (G.R. No. 123708): Defines the role of a confidential employee.

**Statutory References:**

*   Philippine Constitution, Article IX (B), Section 2
*   Civil Service Law, Section 46 (a), Chapter 7
*   Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations, Section 22, Rule XIV
