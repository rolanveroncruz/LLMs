Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Odilon L. Martinez v. B&B Fish Broker/Norberto M. Lucinario* (G.R. No. 179985, September 18, 2009)

**Summary:** This case involves a petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision regarding an illegal dismissal claim.  The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately *granted* the petition, reversing the CA and reinstating the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) resolution that found the employee, Martinez, to have been illegally dismissed.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Issue:** Whether Martinez was illegally dismissed or abandoned his employment.
*   **Ruling:** The SC held that Martinez was *constructively* dismissed. The employer, Lucinario, failed to prove abandonment.
*   **Constructive Dismissal:**  The SC found that actions by the employer (removal from logbook, denial of leave, refusal of entry) created an impossible and unreasonable work environment, amounting to constructive dismissal.
*   **Abandonment:** The employer (Lucinario) asserted abandonment, but the SC found no evidence of Martinez's *intention* to abandon his job.  Martinez's immediate filing of the illegal dismissal complaint with prayer for reinstatement countered any assertion of abandonment.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The SC reiterated that in illegal dismissal cases, the employer bears the burden of proving just cause for termination or, in this case, abandonment by substantial evidence.
*   **Reinstatement and Backwages:** The NLRC decision, reinstated by the SC, ordered the employer to reinstate Martinez with full backwages from the date of dismissal until reinstatement. The labor arbiter found salary differentials, unpaid salaries and pro-rata 13th month pay.

**Obligations:**

*   The employer (B&B Fish Broker/Lucinario) is obligated to reinstate Martinez to his former position.
*   The employer is obligated to pay Martinez full backwages from the date of dismissal until reinstatement.
*   The employer is obligated to pay salary differentials, unpaid salaries and pro-rata 13th month pay.

**Liabilities:**

*   The employer is liable for illegally dismissing Martinez.
*   The employer is liable for backwages and other monetary benefits due to the illegal dismissal.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Proof of Payment:**  The burden lies on the employer to prove payment of wages and benefits. Any ambiguity will likely be resolved against the employer.
*   **Computation of Backwages:**  The exact amount of backwages is not detailed in the decision and will need to be computed based on Martinez's salary at the time of dismissal, up to the date of actual reinstatement.  This calculation can be a source of dispute.
*   **Reinstatement Practicality:**  Whether reinstatement is practically feasible after a lengthy legal battle is a potential concern, although legally mandated.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The case underscores the legal principles surrounding illegal dismissal, particularly the employer's burden of proof to show just cause.  It implicates Article 294 (formerly 279) of the Labor Code regarding security of tenure and remedies for illegal dismissal.
*   **Abandonment:** The decision reiterates the established requirements for proving abandonment: (1) failure to report to work without valid reason, and (2) a clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship. *Note:* the Labor Code provisions, specifically Article 294 concerning illegal dismissal and remedies (reinstatement, backwages), are critically relevant.
*   **Rules of Evidence:** The SC recognized that the Rules of Evidence are not strictly applied in administrative proceedings like those before the Labor Arbiter.

This summary provides a legally concise overview of the *Martinez v. B&B Fish Broker* decision. Further investigation might be needed to calculate specific monetary awards and to assess the feasibility of reinstatement.
