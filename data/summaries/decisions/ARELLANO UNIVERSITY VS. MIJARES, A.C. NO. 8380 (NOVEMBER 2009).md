## Legal Document Summary: *Arellano University, Inc. vs. Atty. Leovigildo H. Mijares III* (A.C. No. 8380)

**Nature:** Disbarment case against Atty. Mijares for failure to account for funds entrusted by his client, Arellano University, Inc.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Engagement:** The University engaged Mijares to secure a certificate of title.
*   **Funds Entrusted:** The University provided Mijares with P500,000 for "facilitation and processing" expenses, with the promise of return if the work was not completed.
*   **Failure to Account:** Mijares failed to provide proof of MMDA approval, became unreachable, and failed to return the P500,000 despite formal demand.
*   **Mijares' Defense:** Mijares claimed the money was given to Undersecretary Lacuna for a favorable MMDA endorsement with the University's consent. He further claimed the University withheld information about a previous, identical application.
*   **IBP Findings:** The IBP found that the University did not authorize the payment to Lacuna and that Mijares admitted to bribing a government official. The IBP initially recommended indefinite suspension.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court disbarred Mijares, finding him guilty of violating Rules 1.01 and 1.02, Canon 15, Rule 15.05, Canon 16, Rules 16.01 and 16.03, and Canon 18, Rule 18.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. He was also directed to return all relevant documents to the University.

**Obligations:**

*   **Atty. Mijares:** Has an obligation to promptly account for and properly utilize funds entrusted by his client.
*   **Atty. Mijares:** Has an obligation to refrain from engaging in dishonest and illegal conduct, including bribery.
*   **Atty. Mijares:** Has an obligation to provide competent representation, including maintaining communication and not abandoning his client.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Professional Liability:** Disbarment for violating the Code of Professional Responsibility.
*   **Potential Criminal Liability:** The Supreme Court forwarded Mijares' sworn statement to the Office of the Ombudsman for potential investigation and prosecution related to bribery.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **University:** Risk of being implicated in bribery due to its admitted knowledge of "facilitation" fees. The Court explicitly refused to order the return of funds, recognizing the inherent illegality of the purpose for which it was given.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 27, Rule 138 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Grounds for disbarment or suspension of a lawyer.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility:** The entire case revolves around violations of the CPR, specifically:

Aliño, 130 Phil. 510, 512 (1968); Sipin- Nabor v. Baterina, 412 Phil. 419, 424 (2001)* - Illustrating standards of accountability for trust funds, especially when not used for the original purpose.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Facilitation and Processing":** This euphemistic phrase clearly refers to bribery, a fact acknowledged by the Court.
*   **University's Conformity:** Mijares' claim of the University's consent to the payment to Lacuna is contentious. If true, it could implicate the University in the bribery scheme.

**Overall:**

This case highlights the stringent ethical obligations of lawyers, particularly regarding client funds. Mijares' failure to account for the money, combined with his admission of bribery, warranted disbarment. The court sends a clear message that it will not condone unethical behavior and will not assist in recovering funds used for illicit purposes. It is also a reminder of the importance of clear and ethical fee arrangements and proper accounting of client funds. The University's role in the matter, while not explicitly penalized, is scrutinized and serves as a cautionary tale.
