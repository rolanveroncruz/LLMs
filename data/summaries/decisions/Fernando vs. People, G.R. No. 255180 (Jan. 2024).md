## Legal Document Summary: *Conrado Fernando, Jr. v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 255180)

**Type:** Resolution on Petition for Review on Certiorari

**Core Issue:** Whether Conrado Fernando, Jr. is guilty of Estafa under Article 315(2)(a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA's decision and *acquitted* Fernando of Estafa due to failure of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions and Elements:**

*   **Estafa (Art. 315(2)(a) RPC):**  The Court outlines the elements of Estafa by means of deceit: (a) false pretense/fraudulent representation; (b) representation made prior to/simultaneously with the fraud; (c) offended party relied on the representation and parted with money/property; (d) offended party suffered damage. *People v. Sison, 816 Phil. 8 (2017)* is cited.
*   **Forum Shopping:**  The Court rejected the argument that the private complainant engaged in forum shopping. Cites *Rodriguez v. Ponferrada, 503 Phil. 306 (2005)*: A single act of issuing a bouncing check can give rise to both Estafa and violation of BP 22, allowing simultaneous civil remedies, but prohibiting double recovery.
*   **Double Recovery (Art. 2177 Civil Code):**  The CA correctly deleted the award of actual damages because the petitioner had already paid the amount in a BP 22 case arising from the same transaction. The principle of preventing unjust enrichment is cited.
*   **IATA Membership:**  The Court held that the RTC erred in assuming Airward's lack of IATA membership equated to fraudulent misrepresentation. Testimony of Natalie Arevalo established that non-IATA members can sell tickets.

**Key Arguments and Reasoning:**

*   **Lack of False Pretense:** The Court found that the prosecution failed to prove that the representation by Fernando (as an employee of Airward) that Airward was authorized to sell tour packages was fraudulent. The Court emphasized that Airward's status as a non-IATA member did not preclude it from selling tour packages through arrangements with IATA-member agencies.
*   **Fernando's Role as Employee:** The Court highlighted that Fernando acted as an employee of Airward and the evidence shows Airward is a legitimate business entity. Thus, his actions were on behalf of Airward, not for his personal gain.
*   **Insufficient Evidence of False Advertisement:** The prosecution failed to demonstrate that Airward's tour package advertisement was false or invalid. The mere failure of the trip to materialize is insufficient proof of fraudulent intent.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   The case highlights the importance of establishing a clear causal link between the accused's actions and the victim's alleged damages in estafa cases, especially where the accused is acting as an agent for a company.
*   The decision reaffirms the principle against double recovery but also underscores the permissibility of simultaneous prosecution of estafa and BP 22 charges arising from the same set of facts.
