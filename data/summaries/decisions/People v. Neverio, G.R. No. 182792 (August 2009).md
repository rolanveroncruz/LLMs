**Case Summary: *People v. Neverio*, G.R. No. 182792 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for two counts of rape under Art. 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353).

**Facts:** Accused-Appellant (Pepito Neverio) was convicted of raping his cousin (AAA), who was allegedly mentally deficient, on two separate occasions.  The prosecution's case rested on AAA's testimony, corroborated by medico-legal evidence of a healed hymenal laceration.  The prosecution alleged force and intimidation (use of a knife). The accused filed a Demurrer to Evidence but presented no further defense.

**Key Provisions & Legal Principles:**

*   **Art. 266-A, Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **Rape of a Demented Person:** When the victim is demented, force is immaterial, and lack of consent is presumed. (Cites *People v. Lopez*, G.R. Nos. 135671-72). Sexual intercourse is the only element that must be proven in order to convict an accused.
*   **Force and Intimidation:** Defined as "relative" to the circumstances, requiring evaluation of parties’ size, age, strength and relation.  Pointing a knife is considered strongly suggestive of force/intimidation, negating the need to prove resistance. (Cites *People v. Galido*, G.R. Nos. 148689-92; *People v. Baylen*, G.R. No. 135242; *People v. Dela Peña*, G.R. No. 128372)
*   **Jurisdiction:** For the court to acquire jurisdiction over a criminal case, the offense or any of its essential elements should have taken place within the territorial jurisdiction of the court. (Cites *People v. Macasaet*, G.R. No. 156747, and Uy v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 119000, July 28, 1997). Determined based on allegations in the complaint/information.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Accused-Appellant: Found guilty of two counts of rape.  Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* for each count. Ordered to pay Php 50,000 civil indemnity, Php 50,000 moral damages, and Php 30,000 exemplary damages *per count*. Liable for costs.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Mental Retardation:** The Court held that the evidence on victim's mental retardation was inconsequential because the conviction was based on force and intimidation.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** Court rejects argument that it was incredible for the accused to hold a knife with one hand while undressing and committing the act with the other. The CA and SC found that the Prosecution had sufficiently proved the crime of rape by presenting evidence such as the victim's testimony as well as medico-legal reports.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Lopez*, G.R. Nos. 135671-72
*   *People v. Galido*, G.R. Nos. 148689-92
*   *People v. Baylen*, G.R. No. 135242
*   *People v. Dela Peña*, G.R. No. 128372
*   *People v. Macasaet*, G.R. No. 156747
*   Uy v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 119000
*   *People v. Sia, G.R. No. 174059

**Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   The defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove AAA's mental retardation (no medical findings presented) and that the level of force and intimidation was not credible.
*   The defense also challenged the court's jurisdiction, alleging that the victim failed to specify the exact location of the crime in her testimony.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision with modification, increasing the damages by adding exemplary damages.
