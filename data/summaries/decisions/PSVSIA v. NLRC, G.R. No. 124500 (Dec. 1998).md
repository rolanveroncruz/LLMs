**Case Summary: *Philippine Scout Veterans Security and Investigation Agency, Inc. v. NLRC and Florentino Lamsen*, G.R. No. 124500 (1998)**

**Facts:**

*   Florentino Lamsen filed a complaint for illegal deduction and underpayment of wages/overtime against his employer, Philippine Scout Veterans Security and Investigation Agency, Inc. (PSVSIA), its manager Severo Santiago, and stockholder Ricardo Bona.
*   Labor Arbiter (LA) ruled in favor of Lamsen.
*   NLRC modified the LA decision, extending the retroactive period of the monetary award.
*   PSVSIA appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Wage Underpayment and Overtime Pay:** Lamsen alleged underpayment of minimum wage and overtime pay, supported by submitted payment records.
*   **Employer's Defense:** PSVSIA initially claimed Lamsen was employed by an affiliate, later shifting to a defense of full payment, supported by payroll photocopies.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The core issue revolves around the authenticity of the payroll photocopies submitted by PSVSIA. NLRC questioned their authenticity due to the absence of Lamsen's signature but denied PSVSIA's motion to submit original documents, which contained Lamsen's signatures.
*   **Personal Liability:** NLRC held Ricardo Bona (stockholder) and Severo Santiago (manager) personally liable.

**Legal Issues and Holdings:**

*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion by NLRC:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in rejecting PSVSIA's evidence (payroll photocopies) and denying them the opportunity to present the original documents. The SC cited Article 221 of the Labor Code, emphasizing that technical rules of evidence should not be strictly applied in labor cases to determine facts speedily and objectively in the interest of due process.  Citing *Vallende v. NLRC*, the Court stated that technicality should not prevent a fair resolution. *Imperial Textile v. NLRC* was referenced to support the claim of using all reasonable means to ascertain the facts of a controversy.
*   **Remand for Further Evidence:** The case was remanded to the NLRC to allow PSVSIA to present the original payroll documents.
*   **Personal Liability of Corporate Officers:** The SC also found that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion by holding Bona and Santiago personally liable without proof of malice or bad faith. Citing *Seaborne Carriers Corp. v. NLRC*, the court stated that evidence of malice or bad faith is required to hold corporate officers personally liable.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 221, Labor Code:** Relaxation of evidentiary rules in labor cases.

**Case Law:**

*   **Vallende v. NLRC, G.R. No. 110321, 7 July 1995, 245 SCRA 662.**
*   **Imperial Textile v. NLRC, G.R. No. 101527, 19 January 1993, 217 SCRA 237.**
*   **Bristol Laboratories Employees Association v. NLRC, G.R. No. 87974, 2 July 1990, 187 SCRA 118.**
*   **Phil. Singapore Ports Corp. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 67035, 29 January 1993, 218 SCRA 77.**
*   **Seaborne Carriers Corp. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 88795, 4 October 1994, 237 SCRA 343.**

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** The primary risk is whether the original payrolls will actually support PSVSIA's claim of full payment. The NLRC's initial doubts about the photocopies suggest potential discrepancies.
*   **Standard of Proof:** The burden is on PSVSIA to prove that Lamsen was paid the correct wages and overtime.
*   **Ambiguity in Overtime Calculation:** The Court noted Lamsen's failure to demonstrate that overtime payments received were less than the required amount. This suggests that the manner of calculating overtime due may still be contentious.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the NLRC decision due to procedural errors and remanded the case for further factual determination. The key is whether PSVSIA can prove full payment with the original payroll documents. The personal liability of the officers is unlikely without evidence of malice or bad faith.
