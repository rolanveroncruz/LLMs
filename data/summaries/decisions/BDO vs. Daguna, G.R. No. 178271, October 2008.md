Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Banco De Oro-EPCI, Inc. v. Hon. Zenaida R. Daguna and Philippine Development and Industrial Corporation* (G.R. No. 178271, October 31, 2008)

**Issue:** Whether Philippine Development and Industrial Corporation (PDIC) engaged in forum shopping by filing separate actions in the Makati RTC (Civil Case No. 03-401) and the Manila RTC (Civil Case No. 03-106886).

**Facts:**

*   PDIC obtained a credit line from PCI Bank (later Equitable PCI Bank, now Banco de Oro-EPCI).
*   PDIC defaulted, leading to a Repayment Agreement secured by REMs.
*   After further default, EPCIB initiated foreclosure.
*   PDIC filed a complaint in Makati RTC for "Cancellation of Mortgage, Restitution of Titles and Damages," later amended to "Release of Mortgage and Damages," then ultimately, "Damages."
*   Simultaneously, PDIC filed a complaint in Manila RTC for "Annulment of Mortgage and the Foreclosure Sale."
*   BDO-EPCI argued forum shopping.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court held that PDIC did NOT engage in forum shopping.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Forum Shopping:** Defined by the Court as dividing a single cause of action into multiple suits.
*   **Identity of Causes of Action Test:**  The test is whether the same evidence would support both actions. *Serdoncillo v. Spouses Benolirao, 358 Phil. 83, 103.*
*   **Splitting a Cause of Action:** Splitting a cause of action is the act of dividing a single cause of action, claim or demand into two or more parts, and bringing suit for one of such parts only, intending to reserve the rest for another separate action.*Mallion v. Alcantara, G.R. No. 141528, October 31, 2006, 506 SCRA 336, 343-344; Perez v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 157616, July 22, 2005, 464 SCRA 89, 104; Spouses Romero v. Tan, 468 Phil. 224, 239 (2004); Sta. Lucia Realty and Development, Inc. v. Cabrigas, 411 Phil. 369, 386 (2001).*
*   **Cause of Action Differences:** While both cases stemmed from the same factual background (the credit line and subsequent default), the causes of action differed. The Manila RTC case involved annulment of the mortgage and foreclosure sale (action in rem), requiring proof of vitiated consent, fraud, or irregularities. The Makati RTC case sought damages for the alleged wrongful refusal to release funds (action in personam), requiring evidence of the bank's willful refusal and the resulting losses to PDIC.
*   **Venue:** The Court emphasized the importance of venue. After the foreclosure, an action for annulment of the foreclosure sale was properly filed in Manila where the properties are located.
*   **Nature of Action:** Prior to foreclosure, an action to release a mortgage is a personal action.  *Hernandez v. Rural Bank of Lucena, 171 Phil. 70 (1978).*

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Certification of Non-Forum Shopping:** The Court acknowledged that PDIC's initial certification of non-forum shopping was "not exactly accurate" as the reinstatement of the "Damages" action in Makati was still pending. However, this was not deemed fatal, given the eventual reinstatement of the "Damages" action and the ultimate distinctions between the causes of action.
*   **Splitting Cause of Action Argument:** The dissent could potentially have argued that the damages claim should have been included in the Manila RTC case concerning the annulment of mortgage if the damages were a direct result of the allegedly invalid mortgage. The Court, however, found the venues had been properly laid.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   BDO-EPCI remains liable to potentially face the damages claim in the Makati RTC case.
*   PDIC is obligated to pursue its annulment and foreclosure sale challenge in the Manila RTC case.

**Implications:**

This case underscores the importance of carefully defining causes of action and understanding the difference between actions in rem and in personam to avoid allegations of forum shopping. It clarifies that similar facts do not necessarily equate to identical causes of action and that venue considerations are crucial.
