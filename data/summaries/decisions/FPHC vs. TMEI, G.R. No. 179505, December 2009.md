## Legal Document Summary: *First Philippine Holdings Corporation v. Trans Middle East (Phils.) Equities Inc.*

**Case:** G.R. No. 179505, December 4, 2009 (622 Phil. 623)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 seeking reversal of Sandiganbayan Resolutions dismissing FPHC's Complaint-in-Intervention in Civil Case No. 0035 (PCGG ill-gotten wealth case against Benjamin Romualdez). Dismissal was based on prescription.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Sale of PCIB Shares:** FPHC (then Meralco Securities) sold 6,299,179 shares of common stock in Philippine Commercial International Bank (PCIB), now Equitable-PCI Bank, to TMEE on May 24, 1984.
*   **Complaint-in-Intervention:** FPHC filed a Complaint-in-Intervention on December 28, 1988, claiming the sale was fraudulent and seeking ownership of the shares.
*   **Sandiganbayan Ruling:** Dismissed FPHC's Complaint-in-Intervention based on prescription under Article 1391 of the Civil Code, finding the 4-year period to annul the sale based on fraud had lapsed.
*   **FPHC's Arguments:** Contends that the sale was either voidable or void, the prescriptive period should be counted from the cessation of intimidation (deposition of Marcos in 1986), or that the issue of prescription cannot be resolved without trial. Alternatively, FPHC contended that the sale was *void ab initio* due to being approved by a "dummy board", rendering the action imprescriptible.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **FPHC:** Obligation to timely assert its rights to the PCIB shares, subject to the prescriptive period under the Civil Code. The Court determined FPHC failed to do so.
*   **TMEE:** The Sandiganbayan found that TMEE was not obligated to give up the stock to FPHC since FPHC's claim was time-barred.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Determination of *Void vs. Voidable* Contract:** The central issue is whether the sale was void *ab initio* or merely voidable.  The Supreme Court affirmed the Sandiganbayan's ruling that the sale was voidable, relying on the fact that the board of directors had the power to consent to the sale and the claim centered on fraud in the operation of the board. The Court distinguished this from *Islamic Directorate of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals* (338 Phil. 970 (1997)), where the sale was made by an unauthorized entity whose election was voided by the SEC.
*   **Prescriptive Period (Article 1391, Civil Code):** The application of the 4-year prescriptive period from the date of the fraudulent sale is a major point of contention. FPHC argues it should begin from the cessation of intimidation in 1986, which the court rejected based on the explicit claim of "fraud" rather than intimidation in the complaint and the awareness of the fraud.
*   **Fraud Claim & "Dummy Board":** The allegation of a "dummy board" controlled by Romualdez and the associated fraud is the foundation of FPHC's claim. If proven, it could potentially challenge the validity of the sale. However, the Court determined that this issue would not overcome the fact that the prescriptive period had expired.
*   **Due Process:** FPHC claimed it was denied due process because the trial court did not allow them to present evidence. However, the Court disagreed, citing the numerous pleadings filed and the hearing on the motion to dismiss.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1318, Civil Code:** Essential requisites of a contract (consent, object, cause).
*   **Article 1390, Civil Code:** Definition of voidable contracts.
*   **Article 1391, Civil Code:** Prescriptive period for annulment of voidable contracts.
*   **Section 23, Corporation Code:** Powers of the board of directors.
*   **Islamic Directorate of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals (338 Phil. 970 (1997)):** Distinguished on the basis that the selling entity was unauthorized.
*   **Philippine Free Press, Inc. v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 132864, 24 October 2005, 473 SCRA 639):** Held that mistrust of courts is not an excuse for non-compliance with the prescriptive period.
*    **Gicano v. Gegato, G.R. No. L-63575, 20 January 1988, 157 SCRA 140** Trial court has the discretion to dismiss an action on the ground of prescription

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the Sandiganbayan's dismissal of FPHC's Complaint-in-Intervention due to prescription. The crucial factor was the court's determination that the contract was voidable due to fraud, not void *ab initio*, and that the 4-year prescriptive period began from the date of the fraudulent sale, a period which FPHC had exceeded. The Court emphasized that the pleadings reflected that FPHC was aware of the alleged fraudulent nature of the sale in 1984.
