**Case Summary: *Neri v. Yu*, G.R. No. 230831 (Sept. 5, 2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision holding petitioner Maribelle Neri jointly liable with Bridgette Insoy for P1,200,000.00 to respondent Ryan Roy Yu, representing payment for a Toyota Grandia that was never delivered.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Joint Liability:** Neri and Insoy are held jointly liable for the undelivered vehicle payment of P1,200,000.00.
*   **Interest:** The principal amount is subject to 12% interest per annum from March 12, 2009 to June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until fully satisfied, as per Central Bank Circular Nos. 799 and 417. (Implied)

**Factual Background & Court Reasoning:**

Yu paid Neri P1,200,000.00 for a Toyota Grandia after being convinced by Neri. Neri received the payment into her account and issued a receipt. The vehicle was never delivered, and Neri claimed she only acted as an intermediary, forwarding the funds to Insoy, who was the actual vendor. The RTC and CA found against Neri. The Supreme Court affirmed, holding Neri jointly liable, finding that she acted as a seller, not a mere conduit, based on the totality of the circumstances. Neri received payments, issued a receipt, and actively participated in convincing Yu to buy the car. Neri's defense of merely facilitating an online order was rejected, focusing on her active role in the transaction, offering discounts, and providing transportation. The court held that she acted as a seller, creating a contractual obligation to deliver the vehicle.

**Obligations:**

*   **Neri & Insoy:** Joint obligation to reimburse Yu P1,200,000.00 plus interest.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Neri:** Direct financial liability for the principal amount and accruing interest.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Collectability from Insoy:** The effectiveness of joint liability depends on Insoy's financial standing and the ability to enforce the judgment against her. Insoy is involved in an Estafa case which implies potential for being judgment-proof.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs Petitions for Review on Certiorari, limiting the scope of review to questions of law.
*   **Civil Code (Implied):** The court's ruling implies the existence of a contract of sale between Neri and Yu, creating obligations under Articles 1458 (contract of sale), 1169 (delay), and 1170 (liability for damages).
*   **Interest Rates (Implied):** Legal interest rates set by Central Bank Circular Nos. 799 and 417 which reflect changes in prevailing interest rates on legal obligations.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Receipt issued by Neri does not state it is an acknowledgement of receipt on behalf of Insoy, or that Neri is acting as a mere agent or middleman for the sale.
*   The exact nature of Neri's representation. Although the court found her to be acting as a seller, the lack of a formal agency agreement or formal written contract makes this finding potentially contentious, although the court clearly stated it believed Yu was convinced he was buying from Neri not through her.

**Legal Analysis for Litigation:**

The Supreme Court upheld the factual findings of the lower courts, which are generally binding. The key issue was whether Neri acted as a seller or merely a facilitator. The court emphasized the totality of circumstances, focusing on Neri's actions and representations, and not solely on whether she explicitly claimed to be the seller. The lack of a formal contract of sale or agency agreement was not determinative. The defense based on petitioner not being the "seller" was rendered insufficient by the totality of evidence, particularly Neri having received payment and issuing the receipt. The court was unconvinced that Neri's involvement was merely accommodating when substantial sums were transacted, and Neri provided transportation, convincing Yu to buy. This could influence future litigation regarding similar situations involving informal sales and facilitation.
