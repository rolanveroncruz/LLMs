## Legal Document Summary: *Harry G. Lim vs. Aniano Desierto, et al.*

**Case:** G.R. No. 154992, February 13, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the Ombudsman's dismissal of petitioner Lim's complaints against former DENR Secretary Cerilles and Undersecretary Dela Pe単a.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Allegations:** Lim alleged that Cerilles violated RA 3019 Sec. 3(e) (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) by issuing an order reinstating a Foreshore Lease Agreement (FLA) in favor of Cantoja, thereby causing him undue injury. The order allegedly preempted court action in a related case (Civil Case No. 6438) and was issued prematurely and in bad faith ("midnight decision").  He also alleged that Dela Pe単a violated RA 6713 Sec. 4(b) & (d) (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees) by recommending his law partner as legal counsel and RA 3019 Sec. 3(e) and 3(k) by providing Cantoja's counsel an advance copy of the order.
*   **Ombudsman's Findings:** The Ombudsman dismissed the complaints for lack of probable cause, finding that the perceived undue injury to Lim was not apparent, the reinstatement of the FLA did not affect pending court proceedings, and the issue of title nullity would be determined in a separate action by the OSG. They also considered Dela Pena's actions an administrative matter.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** Affirmed the Ombudsman, finding no grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the complaints.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the CA, reiterating the principle of non-interference in the Ombudsman's determination of probable cause absent grave abuse of discretion. The Court noted that the issues were closely linked to the pending DENR case before the Office of the President (OP), and that the OP's affirmation of Cerilles' order argued against any alleged irregularity.
*   **Core issue:** Whether the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the criminal complaints against Cerilles and dela Pe単a for lack of probable cause to violate RA 3019 and RA 6713.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The case does not define any new obligations or liabilities. It primarily addresses the extent of the Ombudsman's discretion in investigating and prosecuting public officials.
*   Petitioner attempted to establish culpability of public officials under existing anti-graft and ethical conduct laws (RA 3019, RA 6713).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioner:** The petitioner failed to establish grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Ombudsman.  Attempts to compel the Ombudsman to file charges are generally unsuccessful unless a clear showing of grave abuse exists. The pendency of related administrative proceedings (DENR case before OP) and civil litigation weakens the criminal case.
*   **Public Officials:** While cleared in this particular instance, public officials remain subject to scrutiny under anti-graft laws.  The allegations of impropriety in administrative decision-making, including alleged premature release of decisions and potential conflicts of interest, can lead to further investigation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Specifically, Section 3(e) regarding causing undue injury or giving unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence, and 3(k).
*   **RA 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees):** Specifically, Section 4(b) & (d) regarding professionalism and political neutrality.
*   ***Jose Lopez, Jr. v. Office of the Ombudsman*** **(G.R. No. 140529, September 6, 2001, 364 SCRA 569):** Petitioner unsuccessfully cited this case to compel the Ombudsman to file charges.
*   ***Alba v. Nitorreda*** **(G.R. No. 120223, March 13, 1996, 254 SCRA 753):**  Established the principle against judicial review of the Ombudsman's discretion in prosecuting or dismissing complaints.
*   ***Presidential Commission on Good Government v. Desierto*** **(G.R. No. 140358, December 8, 2000, 347 SCRA 561):** Affirmed the Ombudsman's broad discretion in determining whether to file a criminal case.
*   ***Vda. de Jacob v. Puno*** **(G.R. Nos. 61554-55, July 31, 1984, 131 SCRA 144):**Reiterated the power of supervision and control of the Ombudsman over investigating officers.
*   ***Roxas v. Vasquez*** **(G.R. No. 114944, June 19, 2001, 358 SCRA 636):** Affirmed the court's policy of non-interference with the Ombudsman's determination of probable cause.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of "undue injury" under RA 3019 Sec. 3(e) is often fact-specific and subject to interpretation.  Whether the reinstatement of the FLA constituted an "unwarranted benefit" to Cantoja is debatable.
*   The characterization of Dela Pe単a's actions (recommending counsel, alleged advance release of order) as merely "administrative" versus potential violations of ethical conduct laws is a point of contention.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the broad discretionary power of the Ombudsman in determining probable cause. The ruling underscores the heavy burden on complainants seeking to overturn the Ombudsman's decisions and the importance of exhausting administrative remedies before pursuing criminal complaints. The court will be unlikely to compel the Ombudsman to file charges without a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion which was not successfully demonstrated in this case.
