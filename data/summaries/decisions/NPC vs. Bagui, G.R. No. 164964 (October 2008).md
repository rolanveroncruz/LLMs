**Legal Document Summary: NPC v. Bagui, G.R. No. 164964**

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision in an expropriation case filed by the National Power Corporation (NPC).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Eminent Domain:** NPC sought an easement of right-of-way for its San Pascual Cogeneration Associated Transmission Line Project over land owned by respondents.
*   **Just Compensation:** The core issue revolves around the proper valuation of the expropriated land for just compensation.  NPC argues for application of Section 3-A(b) of RA 6395 (as amended by PD 938), limiting compensation for right-of-way easements to 10% of market value. Respondents argue for full market value due to the nature and extent of deprivation of beneficial use.
*   **Valuation Methodology:** NPC challenges the valuation reports of the two sets of commissioners, alleging reliance on speculative "opinion value" (specifically CALABARZON value) and hearsay evidence (barangay chairman's opinion and provincial assessor's estimate).
*   **Commissioners' Reports:** The first report (Bagui property) considered average sales data, zonal valuation, and loan value. The second report (Macaraig and Valdez properties) primarily relied on a Provincial Appraisal Committee Resolution (03-99) setting the fair market value and unsubstantiated information on the sale of a similar lot.

**Obligations:**

*   **NPC:** To pay just compensation for the expropriated land.

**Liabilities:**

*   **NPC:** Potentially liable for full market value of the expropriated land, not merely 10% of market value as per RA 6395 as interpreted for simple right-of-way cases where the land is fully taken by the placement of transmission lines and utility poles. This liability extends to consequential damages, where applicable, especially if there is an effective deprivation of use.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Higher Compensation Costs:** The Court reiterates its stance that the determination of just compensation is a judicial function, and statutory valuation guidelines are not binding.  *National Power Corporation v. Manubay Agro-Industrial Development Corporation*, *NPC v. Bongbong*, *NPC v. Purefoods*, and *NPC v. Aguirre-Paderanga* all reinforce the principle that full market value is required when the easement effectively deprives the landowner of the normal use of their property.  Therefore, relying solely on the 10% limitation in RA 6395 is risky given prevailing jurisprudence.
*   **Procedural Defects in Valuation:** The second set of commissioners' reliance on outdated (Resolution 03-99) and unsubstantiated information may lead to further litigation and increased costs. The court found no explanation of the similarities in the nature, character, or condition between the properties of the respondents and the properties subject of the resolution.
*   **Remand Risk:** The court remanded the case back to the trial court for the proper determination of the amount of just compensation with respect to the properties of respondents Macaraig and Valdez.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6395 (as amended by PD 938):**  The basis of NPC's argument for limited compensation (10% of market value).
*   **Rule 67, Section 4 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Defines the date for valuation (date of taking or filing of complaint, whichever is earlier).
*   **National Power Corporation v. Manubay Agro-Industrial Development Corporation (G.R. No. 150936):**  Key precedent holding that full market value is required when an easement effectively deprives the owner of normal land use.
*   **National Power Corporation v. Bongbong (G.R. No. 164079):** Reaffirms the application of market value for right-of-way easements.
*   **NPC v. Purefoods (G.R. No. 160725):**  Supports recovery of consequential damages in addition to market value.
*   **National Power Corporation v. Aguirre-Paderanga (G.R. No. 155065):** Same as NPC v. Purefoods.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of Section 3-A(b) of RA 6395 is contentious. The key issue is whether the easement effectively deprives the landowners of the beneficial use of their properties, thus warranting full market value compensation.
*   The definition of "normal use" and the extent of deprivation required for triggering full market value are subject to interpretation and judicial discretion.

**Summary Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court (SC) partially granted the petition. The CA decision was affirmed regarding the Bagui properties. The valuation for the Macaraig and Valdez properties was deemed flawed, and the case was remanded to the RTC for a proper determination of just compensation. NPC faces a significant risk of being required to pay full market value for the expropriated land, particularly for Macaraig and Valdez as the original valuations were erroneous. NPC's reliance on the 10% limitation in RA 6395 is unlikely to succeed given existing jurisprudence unless proven that an effective deprivation of use of land did not occur because of the transmissions lines and utility poles.
