## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Simon Yap and Milagros Guevarra vs. First E-Bank Corporation* (G.R. No. 169889)

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision regarding the validity of an extrajudicial foreclosure after the creditor (PDCP, now First E-Bank) filed, and subsequently provisionally dismissed, BP 22 cases against the debtor (Sammy Yap) secured by a third-party mortgage provided by his parents (petitioners).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Mortgage Agreement:** Petitioners executed a third-party mortgage on their property to secure a loan obtained by their son, Sammy Yap, from PDCP. The agreement allowed for extrajudicial foreclosure upon default.
*   **Promissory Note & Checks:** Sammy issued a promissory note and post-dated checks as additional security.
*   **BP 22 Cases:** Upon default, PDCP filed six counts of BP 22 against Sammy for the dishonored checks.
*   **Provisional Dismissal:** The BP 22 cases were provisionally dismissed on Sammy's motion without objection from PDCP.
*   **Extrajudicial Foreclosure:** PDCP proceeded with extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgaged property.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:** Petitioners sought an injunction, claiming PDCP waived its right to foreclose by filing the BP 22 cases.

**Obligations:**

*   **Debtor (Sammy Yap):** Obligated to repay the loan.
*   **Mortgagors (Petitioners):** Obligated to allow foreclosure of the mortgaged property upon Sammy's default.
*   **Creditor (First E-Bank):** Obligated to properly account for payments made and only foreclose for the remaining unpaid balance.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Sammy Yap:** Liable for the unpaid loan amount.
*   **Petitioners:** Liable to have their property foreclosed to satisfy the outstanding debt, subject to accounting of payments.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Unjust Enrichment:** The Court emphasizes preventing unjust enrichment of either party. Potential risk of unjust enrichment for Sammy/Petitioners if foreclosure is completely barred despite remaining debt. Potential risk for PDCP if they foreclose without accounting for payments already made.
*   **Splitting a Cause of Action:** The Court explicitly outlines how creditors *can* split a cause of action in the scenario that the original complaint and conviction has taken place.
*   **Valuation of Property and Debt**: There is risk for the property to be undervalued, the loan to be over valued or the final price after sale of property to have the possibility of either party being at a dissadvantage.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **BP 22 (Bouncing Checks Law):** Basis for the criminal charges against Sammy Yap.
*   **Negotiable Instruments Law:** Relevant to the checks issued as security.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 111, Section 1(b):** Incorporates Supreme Court Circular 57-97, which deems a BP 22 criminal action to include a civil action for collection, *but was not yet in effect when PDCP filed suit*.
*   **Supreme Court Circular 57-97:** Governs the filing and prosecution of BP 22 cases.
*   **Lo Bun Tiong v. Balboa (G.R. No. 158177):** Cited to illustrate the non-retroactive application of Circular 57-97.
*   **Bachrach Motor Co., Inc. v. Icarangal (68 Phil. 287):** Discusses the concept of a single cause of action and prohibition against splitting it.
*   **Lozano v. Martinez (G.R. No. L-63419):** Explains the nature and purpose of BP 22, emphasizing it's not merely a debt collection tool.
*   **Vaca v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 131714) and Lim v. People (G.R. No. 130038):** Cases where the Supreme Court imposed a fine instead of imprisonment in BP 22 convictions.
*   **Sections 3 and 4, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court:** Address the prohibition of splitting a single cause of action.
*   **Article III, Section 20 of the Constitution:** Prohibits imprisonment for debt.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The specific terms of the mortgage agreement (beyond the right to extrajudicial foreclosure) are not detailed, potentially affecting the extent of PDCP's rights.
*   The reasons for the check dishonor are not specified which could affect the interpretation of BP22 violation.
*   The exact amounts paid by Sammy and the specific allocation of those payments are not fully clarified, creating potential disputes during the foreclosure accounting.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ruled in favor of First E-Bank (formerly PDCP), holding that the bank was not barred from foreclosing on the petitioners' property. Key rationale included: the BP 22 cases were provisionally dismissed at Sammy's instance; Supreme Court Circular 57-97 was not in effect when the BP 22 cases were filed; and the petitioners knowingly assumed the risk of their property serving as collateral. However, the Court mandated that any foreclosure should only be for the *unpaid balance*, requiring a proper accounting to avoid unjust enrichment. The ruling clarifies the interplay between BP 22 actions and foreclosure proceedings *before* the effectivity of Circular 57-97.
