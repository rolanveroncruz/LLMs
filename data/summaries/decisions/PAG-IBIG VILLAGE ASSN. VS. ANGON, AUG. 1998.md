**Legal Document Summary: *Pag-IBIG Village Association v. Angon*, A.M. No. P-98-1268 (G.R. No. 135369), August 25, 1998**

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Sheriff Aquilino Angon for grave misconduct and defamation related to the implementation of a writ of demolition.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Grave Misconduct:** Allegation that Respondent hastily, prematurely, and illegally implemented a writ of demolition (Civil Case No. 23,484-95) despite a pending Motion for Reconsideration and an alleged agreement for boundary delineation before demolition.
*   **Defamation:** Allegation that Respondent defamed Atty. Reni Dublin (Complainant) by stating he was "paid off" during the demolition.

**Respondent's Defense:**

*   Assigned to implement the writ by the Clerk of Court.
*   Lack of knowledge of the alleged agreement or the pending Motion for Reconsideration.
*   Denial of defamatory remarks, supported by affidavits.
*   Justification for immediate demolition due to defendantsâ€™ repeated reentry onto the property (related to Civil Case No. 295-G-92).
*  Respondent hired Geodetic Engineer to determine the boundaries before commencing demolition activities.

**Court's Findings:**

*   **Defamation Charge Dismissed:** Court deferred to the RTC Judge's (Marasigan) finding that the evidence was insufficient to prove the defamatory statements, and the witnesses provided inconsistent and unreliable testimony,
*   **Misconduct Charge Dismissed:** The Court overturned OCA's recommendation to fine Angon. Found no evidence Angon received or anticipated receiving income from the winning party. Angon's actions were justified by the special order of demolition, the previous order of demolition, the voluntary actions of the Angon in hiring a surveyor, and the delaying tactics of the defendants.

**Obligations:**

*   Sheriffs have a duty to execute writs with reasonable celerity and promptness. *Jumio v. Egay-Eviota, 231 SCRA 551, 555 [1994]*
*   Court Sheriffs must adhere to public office as a public trust. *Sy v. Academia, 198 SCRA 705, 717 [1991]*

**Liabilities:**

*   Sheriffs can be disciplined for failing to meet expectations, including dismissal. However, the Court will protect them against unfounded administrative complaints.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Due Process Concerns:** Though ultimately dismissed, the case highlights the risk of implementing writs while motions for reconsideration are pending. A sheriff's failure to inquire about such motions could lead to accusations of violating due process. *Wenceslao v. Madrazo [247 SCRA 696]*
*   **Liability for Erroneous Implementation:** Though Angon acted properly, had the geodetic engineer been wrong, the sheriff would be held liable for damages if he demolished structures outside the property lines.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 14, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (governing law at the time):** Addressed the Special Order of Demolition's presuppositions.
*   ***Wenceslao v. Madrazo*, 247 SCRA 696:** Cited regarding the duty of sheriffs to ensure proper service and avoid careless presumptions.
*   ***Balais v. Abuda*, 146 SCRA 56:** Reminder to sheriffs about prudence and caution in serving writs.
*   ***Jumio v. Egay-Eviota*, 231 SCRA 551, 555 [1994]; *Padilla v. Arabia*, 242 SCRA 227, 231 [1995]; *Villareal v. Rarama*, 247 SCRA 493, 501 [1995]:** Sheriff's duty to execute writs with reasonable celerity.
*   ***Sy v. Academia*, 198 SCRA 705, 717 [1991]:** Public Office as a public trust.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The alleged agreement for boundary delineation before demolition:** The existence and scope of this agreement are central to the complaint. While there was discussion in court about boundary delineation before demolition, there was no clear indication that it was a condition that bound all parties. In the end, the surveyor was hired to determine the boundaries before the sheriff commenced demolition.
* **Interpretation of "Hasty" Implementation:** The question of what constitutes a "hasty" or "premature" implementation of a writ is fact-dependent and open to interpretation. The Court found that in this case, the implementation was not improper due to the existing special order of demolition.

**Conclusion:** The Court ultimately dismissed the complaint against Sheriff Angon, finding no evidence of grave misconduct or defamation. The decision emphasizes the duties of sheriffs to execute writs promptly but also cautions against baseless complaints that hinder the administration of justice.
