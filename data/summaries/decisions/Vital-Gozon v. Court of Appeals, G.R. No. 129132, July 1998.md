## Legal Document Summary: Vital-Gozon v. Court of Appeals and De la Fuente

**Case:** G.R. No. 129132, July 8, 1998

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding the Court of Appeals' (CA) award of moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees against Isabelita Vital-Gozon in a mandamus action (CA-G.R. SP No. 16438) filed by Alejandro de la Fuente. This is a sequel to G.R. No. 101428, which affirmed the CA's jurisdiction to hear the damages claim.

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Core Dispute:** Gozon (Medical Center Chief) failed to implement a final and executory Civil Service Commission (CSC) resolution ordering the reinstatement of De la Fuente (Chief of Clinics) and payment of back salaries. De la Fuente then filed a special civil action for mandamus with damages.
*   **CSC Resolution:** The CSC declared De la Fuente's demotion illegal and ordered his reinstatement.
*   **Non-Compliance & Mandamus:** Gozon referred the CSC resolution to the DOH legal department and failed to inform De la Fuente which prompted De la Fuente to file a mandamus action.
*   **Procedural Lapses by Gozon:** Despite multiple opportunities and extensions, Gozon failed to file a timely answer to the original and supplemental petitions in the CA.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA originally denied the damages claim in its first decision, but upon reconsideration, modified its decision and scheduled hearings for evidence on damages after a motion for reconsideration was filed.
*   **Gozon's Defense:** She claimed the CA lacked jurisdiction to award damages in a mandamus suit and that she acted on the DOH Legal Department's advice.
*   **Gozon's Answer:** Gozon only filed the Answer after the final resolution of G.R. No. 101428, which was denied by the CA due to prescription. Gozon did not present any evidence in Court.
*   **Damages Awarded:** The CA awarded De la Fuente P50,000 moral damages, P20,000 exemplary damages, and P10,000 attorney's fees.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Gozon's Duty to Comply:** As Medical Center Chief, Gozon had an official duty to implement the final and executory CSC resolution, as per the directive of Section 1 of Article XI (Accountability of Public Officers) of the Constitution.
*   **Liability for Damages:** Under Article 27 of the Civil Code, public officials are liable for damages if they refuse or neglect to perform their official duty without just cause.

*   *Tan Kapoe vs. Masa, 134 SCRA 231*

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Due Process:** Gozon argued a denial of due process due to the CA's refusal to admit her answer. The Court found this claim to be without merit.
*   **Official Capacity Defense:** Gozon argued that she was sued only in her official capacity and therefore was not liable for damages. The Court found that Gozon was sued both in her official and private capacities.
*   **Basis for Damages:** Gozon argued that there was no factual basis for the award of moral and exemplary damages. The Court held that the testimony of De la Fuente established the suffering he incurred.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, holding that Gozon failed to demonstrate any reversible error. The failure to implement the CSC resolution, coupled with the procedural lapses, justified the award of damages.
