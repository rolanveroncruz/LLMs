## Legal Document Summary - People v. Impas

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Elpidio Impas y Polbera*, G.R. No. 176157, June 18, 2009 (affirming CA decision in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 01457)

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of conviction for simple rape under the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Accusation:** Elpidio Impas (Appellant) was charged with rape under the information alleging he had carnal knowledge of AAA (Victim), a minor, by means of force, violence, and intimidation on November 7, 1993.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution presented the testimony of the victim AAA, her sister BBB, and the medico-legal officer, Dr. Jesusa Nieves-Vergara. Medical examination revealed healed lacerations on the victim's hymen and pregnancy (8-9 weeks).  The Appellant presented the defense of alibi.
*   **Findings of Fact:** Both the RTC and CA found the victim's testimony credible and corroborated by BBB. The Appellant's alibi was deemed weak. The courts found sufficient evidence to establish that the appellant indeed raped AAA sometime in November 1993.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Appellant was convicted of *simple rape* and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   Php 50,000 as moral damages.
    *   Php 50,000 as civil indemnity.
    *   Exemplary damages of Php 25,000 initially awarded by the Court of Appeals was later DELETED by the Supreme Court.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Identification of Rape Instance:** Appellant argued that the victim's testimony pertained to a *different* rape incident than the one specifically charged in the information, potentially undermining the *corpus delicti* of the charged offense and violating his right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.
*   **Qualifying Circumstances:** The prosecution failed to specifically allege the qualifying circumstance of filiation in the information. The victim's minority was alleged and proven, but without the relationship qualifier, the conviction could only be for simple rape, not qualified rape.

*   **Lack of Specificity in Information:** The information only specified the date of the *last* rape incident (November 7, 1993) and lacked specific details tying the evidence presented to that specific incident, leaving room for the Appellant's argument.
