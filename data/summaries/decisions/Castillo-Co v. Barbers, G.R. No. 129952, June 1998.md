**Legal Document Summary: _Governor Josie Castillo-Co vs. Honorable Robert Barbers, et al._ (G.R. No. 129952, June 16, 1998)**

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for certiorari and prohibition filed by Governor Josie Castillo-Co seeking to nullify a preventive suspension order issued against her by the Deputy Ombudsman. The suspension arose from a complaint filed by Congressman Junie Cua alleging irregularities in the purchase of heavy equipment, including the purchase of reconditioned equipment instead of brand new equipment and other violations related to overpricing, lack of public bidding, and advance payments.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Preventive Suspension:** The core issue is the validity of the preventive suspension order issued pursuant to Section 24 of RA 6770 (The Ombudsman Act) and Section 9, Rule III of the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman.
*   **Grounds for Suspension:** The Ombudsman or Deputy Ombudsman may preventively suspend an officer if (1) the evidence of guilt is strong, and (2) the charge involves dishonesty, oppression, gross misconduct, or neglect of duty, warrants removal from service, or the respondent's continued stay in office may prejudice the case. (Sec. 24, RA 6770)
*   **Duration of Suspension:** Preventive suspension is limited to six months without pay, unless the delay in disposition is due to the respondent's fault.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Graft and Corruption Charges:** Governor Castillo-Co is accused of violating Sections 3(e) and 3(g) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), and Articles 213 and 217 of the Revised Penal Code (Frauds against the Public Treasury and Malversation).
*   **Disciplinary Action:** The charges, if proven, could lead to removal from office per Section 60(c) of the Local Government Code.
*   **Reputational Harm:** The case has already garnered public attention and will continue to do so, which will impact the Petitioner's reputation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6770 (The Ombudsman Act), Section 24:** Authorizes the Ombudsman or his Deputy to issue preventive suspension orders. The Court interprets the word "or" to mean either the Ombudsman or the Deputy can issue the order.
*   **RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Sections 3(e) and 3(g):** The statutes that the Petitioner allegedly violated.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Articles 213 & 217:** Frauds Against the Public Treasury and Malversation.
*   **Local Government Code, Section 60(c):** Grounds for Disciplinary Actions.
*   **_People vs. Martin, 39 SCRA 430 (1971)_:** Interprets the word "or" as disjunctive.
*   **_Hagad vs. Gozo-Dadole, 251 SCRA 242 (1995)_:** Preventive suspension is not a penalty but a preliminary step.
*   **_Lastimosa vs. Vasquez, 243 SCRA 497 (1995) citing Nera vs. Garcia, 106 Phil. 1031 (1960)_:** The point that suspension can occur even before the defendant has been given an opportunity to answer the administrative complaint.
*    **_Tatad vs. Garcia, 243 SCRA 436 (1995)_:** presumption of regularity of performance of duties for public officials.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **Authority to Issue Suspension Order:** Petitioner argued that only the Ombudsman, and not the Deputy, could issue the suspension order for officials with salary grade 27 or above (citing RA 7975). The Court rejected this argument, citing Section 24 of RA 6770.
*   **Due Process:** Petitioner claimed denial of due process because she was not given a chance to present her side before the suspension order. The Court held that preventive suspension does not require a prior hearing.
*   **Evidence of Influence/Tampering:** Petitioner argued that there was no evidence that she would influence witnesses or tamper with records. The Court stated that the *possibility* of such influence is sufficient.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court DISMISSED the petition, upholding the validity of the preventive suspension order. The temporary restraining order previously issued was LIFTED.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Prosecution on Graft Charges:** The Governor now faces a higher likelihood of a potential trial on the merits of the accusations against her, which could expose her to legal and reputational challenges.
*   **Inability to Perform Duties:** The suspension prevents the Governor from doing her job.
