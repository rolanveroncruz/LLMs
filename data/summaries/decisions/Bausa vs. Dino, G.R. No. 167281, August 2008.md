## Legal Document Summary: Bausa v. Heirs of Dino (G.R. No. 167281)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision that reversed the RTC's decision to revive a judgment in favor of petitioners.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Original Case (Civil Case No. 639):** Petitioners (Bausa) sued respondents' predecessor (Dino) for recovery of possession of land covered by TCT No. 182. RTC ruled in favor of Bausa, declaring them owners and ordering Dino to vacate, pay rent, and attorney's fees.
*   **Appeal & Finality:** Dino appealed to the CA, which was dismissed; final and executory on January 28, 1987. Dino also filed a Petition for Certiorari with the SC, which was dismissed.
*   **Execution Attempts:** Bausa filed motions for execution (granted) and demolition (granted), but these were largely unsuccessful due to Dino's resistance.
*   **Revival Action (Civil Case No. 98-6433):** On January 30, 1998, Bausa filed an independent action to revive the judgment due to the lapse of 5 years for execution by motion. Dino died; heirs (respondents) opposed, claiming prescription.
*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC ruled in favor of Bausa, reviving the judgment.
*   **CA Reversal:** The CA reversed, holding the revival action was time-barred.

**Issues:**

*   Whether the CA erred in disregarding the execution attempts as suspending the prescriptive period for revival.
*   Whether the CA erred in allowing prescription to run against a registered land owner seeking recovery.
*   Whether the CA erred in ruling the revival action was time-barred.
*  Whether the CA erred in Ruling the writ of execution served was not specific as to the area claimed.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, annulling the CA decision and reinstating the RTC's decision to revive the judgment.

**Rationale:**

*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion by CA:** The CA stripped the registered owner of their rights, violating Section 47 of P.D. No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), which protects against prescription or adverse possession against registered land.
*   **Timeliness of Revival Action:** Under Article 1144(3) of the Civil Code and Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, Bausa had 10 years from the judgment's finality (January 28, 1987) to file a revival action. Filing on January 30, 1998, was timely.
*   **Diligence of Petitioners:** Bausa actively pursued execution, but respondents' resistance prevented it. Equity dictates against allowing respondents to benefit from their defiance.
*   **Finality of Ownership:** The issue of ownership was already decided in the original case and is *res judicata*. The CA erred in re-examining ownership based on tax declarations.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1144(3) Civil Code:** 10-year prescriptive period for actions upon a judgment.
*   **Section 6, Rule 39 Rules of Court:** Execution of judgments; revival actions.
*   **Section 47, P.D. No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** No title to registered land acquired by prescription or adverse possession.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **None apparent:** The Supreme Court's decision is definitive, resolving the issue of prescription.
* **Enforcement:** While the judgment is revived, successful execution depends on overcoming any remaining resistance from the respondents.

**Key Takeaways:**

This case reinforces the protection afforded to registered landowners under the Torrens system, the rules on prescription of actions based on judgements, and emphasizes equity in enforcing judgments when execution is frustrated by the judgment debtor.
