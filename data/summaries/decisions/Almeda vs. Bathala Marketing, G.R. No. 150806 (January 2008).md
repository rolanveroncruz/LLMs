## Legal Document Summary: *Almeda vs. Bathala Marketing Industries, Inc.*

**Case:** *Eufemia Almeda and Romel Almeda vs. Bathala Marketing Industries, Inc.*, G.R. No. 150806, January 28, 2008 (566 Phil. 458)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming with modification the RTC decision in a declaratory relief action regarding a lease contract.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** Renewal of lease contract between Ponciano Almeda (later petitioners) and Bathala Marketing Industries, Inc. (BMI) for a portion of the Almeda Compound.
*   **Clause 6 (Taxation):** Lessee (BMI) to pay additional rental corresponding to increased assessment or new taxes imposed on the property. If there is a decrease in the assessment or tax, the lessee should have a reduction in the rental rate, likewise in proportion to the portion leased by him;
*   **Clause 7 (Inflation/Devaluation):** Stipulates payment based on the value of the Philippine peso at the time the obligation was established in case of extraordinary inflation or devaluation.

**Dispute:** Arises from petitioners' demand for VAT payment and rental adjustment based on the lease contract's clauses 6 and 7, which BMI opposed. BMI filed a declaratory relief action.

**Ruling:** Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA decision.

**Key Holdings & Reasoning:**

1.  **Propriety of Declaratory Relief:** The Court held that the action for declaratory relief was proper because the 6 requisites for it were present, including that there was no breach of contract and that there was no adequate relief.
2.  **VAT Liability:** BMI not liable for VAT. The Court found the VAT was not a new tax within the meaning of Clause 6, because RA 7716 took effect in 1994, before the 1997 renewal of the contract. The lessor, Ponciano L. Almeda, opted not to pass on the VAT to the lessee. Petitioners are estopped from shifting the VAT burden to BMI now.
3.  **Rental Adjustment:** No extraordinary inflation or devaluation to justify rental adjustment under Clause 7 and Article 1250 of the Civil Code. The term "devaluation" in Clause 7 was interpreted in harmony with Article 1250. Citing *Filipino Pipe and Foundry Corp. v. NAWASA*, the Court found that the inflation/devaluation was not extraordinary within the meaning of Article 1250 and noted the absence of an official declaration of such.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Article 1250 of the Civil Code:** Addresses the effect of extraordinary inflation or deflation on contractual obligations.
*   **Republic Act (RA) 7716 (VAT Law):** Governs VAT liability on leases.
*   ***Filipino Pipe and Foundry Corp. v. NAWASA, 161 SCRA 32:** Defines extraordinary inflation in the context of contractual obligations.
*   ***Del Rosario v. The Shell Company of the Philippines, 164 SCRA 562:** Regarding the construction of contractual terms, this case was distinguished because of a different factual background.
*   ***Panganiban v. Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation, 443 Phil. 753 (2003).:**
*   ***Teodoro, Jr. v. Mirasol, 99 Phil. 150 (1956).**

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "New Tax":** Clause 6's application hinges on the definition of "new tax." The court determined that RA 7716 was not a new tax at the time of the contract renewal because the VAT law had been in effect since 1994. This highlights the importance of specifying which taxes are covered by such clauses.
*   **Definition of "Extraordinary":** The determination of "extraordinary" inflation/devaluation remains a highly factual issue requiring significant economic evidence and potentially expert testimony. The absence of an official government declaration appears crucial.
*   **Estoppel Argument:** The court's reliance on estoppel based on the original lessor's conduct (not passing on VAT) presents a potential risk for lessors who initially absorb costs but later attempt to pass them on to lessees.

**Note:** The appellate court removed the order for the return of the balance of rental deposits and of the amounts representing the 10% VAT and rental adjustment. This decision was not appealed.
