**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 24-02-09-SC (Re: DOJ-NPS Rules on Preliminary Investigations and Inquest Proceedings)**

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court (SC) issued a Resolution recognizing the authority of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to promulgate its own rules on Preliminary Investigations (PI) and Inquest Proceedings (DOJ-NPS Rules). To facilitate the implementation of these rules, the SC repealed provisions of Rule 112 of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure that are inconsistent with the DOJ-NPS Rules. This repeal is without prejudice to the Court's future promulgation of its own rules on the subject, potentially influenced by the DOJ-NPS Rules.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Recognition of DOJ Authority:** The SC explicitly recognizes the DOJ's authority to promulgate rules on PI and inquest, based on the established principle that PI is an executive function.
*   **Repeal of Conflicting Rule 112 Provisions:** Provisions of Rule 112 of the 2000 Rules that conflict with the DOJ-NPS Rules are repealed.
*   **Future Court Action:** The repeal is without prejudice to the SC promulgating its own rules on PI in the future, potentially drawing from the DOJ-NPS Rules.
*   **Sub-Committee Guidance:** The DOJ-NPS Rules will be used by the SC's Sub-Committee on the Revision of the Rules of Criminal Procedure for future revisions.
*   **Exclusive DOJ Jurisdiction:** The conduct of PI is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DOJ.

**Obligations:**

*   **DOJ:** To promulgate and implement the DOJ-NPS Rules.
*   **SC Sub-Committee:** To review the DOJ-NPS Rules and consider them in drafting future rules on criminal procedure.
*   **Prosecuting Officers:** To adhere to the DOJ-NPS Rules in conducting PIs and inquests.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Resolution does not explicitly outline specific liabilities. However, non-compliance with the newly promulgated DOJ-NPS Rules by prosecuting officers could lead to administrative or legal repercussions.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Inconsistency Disputes:** Potential for disputes arising from the interpretation of what constitutes "inconsistent" provisions between Rule 112 and the DOJ-NPS Rules prior to clarification by jurisprudence.
*   **Future SC Rules:** Uncertainty remains regarding the scope and timing of any future rules on preliminary investigation the SC may promulgate.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Salta v. Court of Appeals***:  Establishes that preliminary investigation is an executive, not a judicial, function.
*   ***People v. Navarro***: Reaffirms that PI is an executive function.
*   ***Chan y Lim v. Secretary of Justice***:  Articulates the policy of non-interference by courts in the conduct of preliminary investigations absent grave abuse of discretion.
*   ***Estipona v. Hon. Lobrigo***: Affirms the exclusive power of the Supreme Court to promulgate rules of pleading, practice, and procedure.
*   ***Hashim v. Boncan***: Clarified that the purpose of preliminary investigation is to determine probable cause.
*   ***People v. Montilla***: Discussed the evolution of the evidence required for preliminary investigation.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 10071 (Prosecution Service Act of 2010):** Mandates the National Prosecution Service to conduct preliminary investigations.
*   **Republic Act No. 5180, as amended by Presidential Decree Nos. 77 and 911 (Uniform System of Preliminary Investigation):** Sets the procedure for preliminary investigation.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "provisions of Rule 112 of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, as amended, inconsistent therewith are deemed REPEALED" might cause disputes.

**Recommendations:**

*   Careful analysis of the new DOJ-NPS Rules is crucial to identify all inconsistencies with the old Rule 112 to ensure consistent application.
*   Prosecuting officers should be thoroughly trained on the new DOJ-NPS Rules to minimize errors and potential challenges.
*   Stay informed about the SC's future actions regarding the promulgation of rules on preliminary investigations.
