## Legal Document Summary: *City of Muntinlupa v. N.C. Tavu and Associates Corporation*

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision, which affirmed the RTC decision, holding the City of Muntinlupa liable for damages and attorney's fees to NCTAC. The dispute arose from the City's rescission of a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) agreement for the "Muntinlupa Skywalk Project."

**Key Provisions:**

*   **BOT Agreement:** Validly executed agreement between NCTAC and the City for the construction of the Skywalk Project under RA 6957 (as amended by RA 7718). The Project was an elevated multi-link pedestrian walkway system with 10 stairways, eight escalators, one elevator, and commercial stalls and spaces. After a 24-month concession period, the facilities were to be transferred to the City of Muntinlupa.
*   **Resolution No. 07-055:** Resolution passed by the *Sangguniang Panlungsod* authorizing the Mayor to construct a similar project with another contractor. This was deemed a nullification of the original BOT agreement. The RTC and CA declared this resolution void and unconstitutional for impairing NCTAC's property rights.
*   **Damages:** The RTC awarded PHP 22,578,000.00 representing actual expenses incurred by NCTAC and PHP 450,000.00 for attorney's fees. Legal interest at 6% per annum applies from the date of the RTC Decision (April 8, 2014) until full payment, with unpaid interest also bearing 6% interest per annum from the same date.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **City of Muntinlupa:** Liable for damages and attorney's fees due to the rescission of the BOT agreement. The CA affirmed the RTC's decision holding the City accountable.
*   **Mayor San Pedro, Engr. Bunyi, and Sangguniang Panlungsod Members (Mayor San Pedro et al.):** Initially impleaded, but not held personally liable. The City's attempt to shift liability to these officials was deemed a barred cross-claim.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Bad Faith Finding:** The RTC and CA did not find sufficient evidence of bad faith, malice, or gross negligence on the part of Mayor San Pedro et al. This was crucial in shielding them from personal liability under Section 38 of the Administrative Code.
*   **Cross-Claim Issue:** The City's attempt to claim against Mayor San Pedro et al. was construed as a cross-claim that should have been raised in the initial Answer. Failure to do so resulted in the claim being barred under Rule 9, Section 2 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Official vs. Personal Capacity:** Mayor San Pedro et al. were sued in their official capacities. Personal liability would require a separate action proving bad faith, malice, or gross negligence. *City of Angeles v. Court of Appeals* is cited to support this.
*   **Article 32 of the Civil Code:** The City argued that Article 32, regarding deprivation of property rights, should make Mayor San Pedro et al. personally liable. However, the Court found that a separate wrong or injury suffered by the plaintiff needs to be proven. *Vinzons-Chato v. Fortune Tobacco Corp.* discusses personal liability of public officers in the performance of their duties.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6957:** Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Law.
*   **RA 7718:** Amendment to RA 6957.
*   **Administrative Code:** Book I, Sections 38 and 39, regarding the liability of public officers.
*   **Civil Code:** Article 32, concerning the violation of rights and liberties.
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 6, Section 8 (Cross-claim), Rule 9, Section 2 (Barred defenses and objections), Rule 11, Section 8 (Counterclaim and Cross-claim).

**Case Law:**

*   *City of Angeles v. Court of Appeals* (329 Phil. 812 (1996)) - On liability of public officials sued in their official capacity.
*   *Vinzons-Chato v. Fortune Tobacco Corp.* (595 Phil. 629 (2008)) - On personal liability of public officers for acts violating constitutional rights.
*   *Lara's Gift and Decors, Inc. v. Midtown lndustrial Sales* and *Nacar v. Gallery Frames* on imposing the legal interest.

**Overall Assessment:**

The City's appeal lacked merit as it raised factual questions already determined by the lower courts. The City failed to establish bad faith on the part of the officials and missed the opportunity to file a cross-claim. The decision reinforces the principle that public officials sued in their official capacity are not personally liable absent proof of malice or bad faith, and highlights the importance of adhering to procedural rules regarding cross-claims. The final imposition of legal interest provides further clarity.
