Here's a legal summary of the *Greenhills Products, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission* case, focusing on the aspects relevant to legal analysis:

**Case:** *Greenhills Products, Inc. and/or Jessie Yu vs. National Labor Relations Commission and Buenaventura F. Abajo* G.R. No. 123950, February 27, 1998 (350 Phil. 306)

**Summary:**

This case involves a petition for certiorari challenging the NLRC's decision finding Greenhills Products, Inc. (GPI) and/or Jessie Yu guilty of unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal of Buenaventura F. Abajo. The Supreme Court affirmed the NLRC decision (with a modification regarding attorney's fees).

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Employee's Allegations:** Abajo claimed he was dismissed for union activities during the 60-day freedom period preceding CBA expiration. He alleged management offered him the presidency of a company-backed union, which he refused, and subsequently campaigned for the Association of Labor Union (ALU). He was then allegedly pressured and subsequently terminated for “loss of trust and confidence.”
*   **Employer's Allegations:** GPI claimed Abajo was dismissed for loss of trust and confidence due to poor performance and the alleged theft and sale of company furniture parts/samples. They alleged an inventory revealed missing items, and a customer inquiry led to discovery of Abajo's alleged illicit sales.
*   **Labor Arbiter Decision:** Initially, the Labor Arbiter dismissed Abajo's complaint for lack of merit, ordering only a minimal indemnity payment.
*   **NLRC Decision:** The NLRC reversed the Labor Arbiter, finding GPI guilty of unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal. It awarded Abajo backwages, separation pay, and attorney's fees.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's Obligation:** The court emphasized that the employer bears the burden of proving just cause for dismissal. *PLDT v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 111933, July 23, 1997) was cited to support this.
*   **Due Process:** The employer must adhere to procedural and substantive due process requirements before termination, furnishing two written notices to the employee *Samillano v. NLRC*, (265 SCRA 788 (1996) *Stolt-Nielsen Marine Services (Phils.) v. NLRC* 264 SCRA 307 (1996) (a) Apprising employee of the acts for which his dismissal is sought. (b) informing the employee of the employer's decision to dismiss him.
*   **Loss of Trust and Confidence:** The court highlighted the guidelines for validly invoking "loss of trust and confidence" as a ground for dismissal, emphasizing it cannot be simulated or used as a subterfuge. *Midas Touch Food Corporation v. NLRC* (259 SCRA 652 (1996)).
*   **Liability:** GPI was held liable for backwages and separation pay due to the illegal dismissal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Unfair Labor Practice Finding:** The finding of unfair labor practice exposes GPI to potential further penalties and scrutiny.
*   **Damages:** The financial exposure due to backwages and separation pay can be significant.
*   **Precedent:** This case serves as a precedent for strict adherence to due process requirements in termination cases and the limitations on using "loss of trust and confidence" as a justification.

**Statutory References:**

*   Labor Code (impliedly, regarding illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice, and due process).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Proof of Theft/Sale:** The evidence supporting GPI's claim of theft and sale of company property was deemed insufficient by the NLRC and affirmed by the Supreme Court. Lack of documentation, investigation, or evidence connecting Abajo directly to the alleged acts was a key weakness.
*   **Motive:** The court found a plausible connection between Abajo's union activity and his dismissal, suggesting the "loss of trust and confidence" was a pretext.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *PLDT v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 111933, July 23, 1997) Burden of proof lies with the employer.
*   *Samillano v. NLRC*, (265 SCRA 788 (1996) requirements of notice and hearing are conditions sine qua non before a dismissal may be validly effected
*   *Stolt-Nielsen Marine Services (Phils.) v. NLRC* 264 SCRA 307 (1996) Two written notices needed
*   *Midas Touch Food Corporation v. NLRC* (259 SCRA 652 (1996). guidelines for the doctrine of loss of confidence to apply
*   *Valiant Machinery and Metal Corporation v. NLRC, 252 SCRA 379 (1996)*; *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals, 262 SCRA 245 (1996)*: Attorney's fees must be justified.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court affirmed the NLRC decision with the modification of deleting the award of attorney's fees for lack of legal and factual basis.
