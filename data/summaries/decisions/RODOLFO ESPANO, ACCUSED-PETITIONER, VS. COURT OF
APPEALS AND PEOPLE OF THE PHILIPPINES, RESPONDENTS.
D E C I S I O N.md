## Legal Document Summary: *Rodolfo Espano v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 120431)

This is a petition for review regarding the conviction of Rodolfo Espano for violation of Section 8, Article II of R.A. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act), as amended, for possession of 5.5 grams of marijuana. The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC's conviction. The Supreme Court denied the petition, but modified the sentence due to the passage of R.A. 7659.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Violation:** Section 8, Article II, R.A. 6425 (possession of prohibited drugs).
*   **Evidence:** 12 cellophane bags of marijuana (5.5 grams). Two were seized during a search incident to a lawful arrest in the street, and ten were seized at Espano's home.
*   **Defense:** Alibi and frame-up.
*   **Penalty:** Originally sentenced to 6 years and 1 day to 12 years imprisonment and a fine of P6,000.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner Rodolfo Espano is obligated to serve the modified indeterminate sentence.
*   The State is obligated to follow proper procedure when enforcing laws against drugs.

**Liabilities:**

*   Espano is criminally liable for possession of prohibited drugs.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The SC ruled the two cellophane bags found on the street were admissible under the "search incident to a lawful arrest" exception. However, the ten bags found at Espano's home were inadmissible due to the lack of a search warrant, citing *People v. Lua* (256 SCRA 539 (1996)).
*   **Presumption of Regularity vs. Presumption of Innocence:** Petitioner argued his right to presumption of innocence was superior to the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty. The Court upheld the presumption of regularity absent evidence of ill motive on the part of the police officers, referencing *People v. Velasco* (252 SCRA 135 (1996)). The court found no evidence that the police framed the accused.
*   **Application of R.A. 7659:** The amendment to the Dangerous Drugs Act (R.A. 7659) took effect after the conviction but before the appeal. This law prescribed penalties based on the quantity of drugs, leading to a more lenient sentence in this case due to the relatively small amount of marijuana, as interpreted in *People v. Simon* (234 SCRA 555 (1994)) and *People v. Lara* (236 SCRA 291 (1994)).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act):** Original statute under which Espano was charged.
*   **R.A. 7659:** Amended the Dangerous Drugs Act, providing for varying penalties based on the quantity of drugs.
*   **Rule 113, Section 5(a), Rules of Court:** Justifies the warrantless arrest based on in flagrante delicto.
*   **Article III, Section 2, 1987 Constitution:** Guarantees freedom against unreasonable searches and seizures.
*   **People v. Lua, 256 SCRA 539 (1996):** Relevant for the ruling on the admissibility of evidence seized from the home.
*   **People v. Velasco, 252 SCRA 135 (1996):** Addresses the presumption of regularity of official duty.
*   **People v. Simon, 234 SCRA 555 (1994) & People v. Lara, 236 SCRA 291 (1994):** Interpretation of penalties under R.A. 7659.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary ambiguity lies in the application of the "search incident to a lawful arrest" doctrine and its spatial and temporal limitations. The court's distinction between the search on the street versus the home underscores the need for clear guidance on the scope of permissible warrantless searches.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld Espano's conviction for possession of marijuana but significantly reduced the sentence by applying R.A. 7659. The ruling clarifies the admissibility of evidence obtained during searches incident to lawful arrests, emphasizing the limitations on warrantless searches of residences.
