**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Francisco Ong and Betty Lim Ong, and Spouses Joseph Ong Chuan and Esperanza Ong Chuan v. BPI Family Savings Bank, Inc.* (G.R. No. 208638, January 24, 2018)**

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and ruled in favor of the Petitioners (Ong Spouses), finding that BPI (as successor-in-interest to BSA) breached a perfected credit line contract, rendering the subsequent extrajudicial foreclosure of the Petitioners' property wrongful.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Credit Line Agreement:** The agreement was a P20,000,000.00 credit facility, consisting of a term loan and a revolving omnibus line.  A perfected contract existed when BSA approved and released P3,000,000.00 of the P5,000,000.00 omnibus credit line.
*   **BSA's Obligation:** BSA was obligated to release the full P5,000,000.00 of the credit line. Failing to do so constituted a breach of contract, specifically Article 1170 of the Civil Code (fraud, negligence, or delay, and those who in any manner contravene the tenor thereof, are liable for damages).
*   **Petitioners' Obligation:** The Petitioners had a reciprocal obligation to repay the loan amount when due and demandable. However, this obligation was contingent upon BSA's full performance of its obligation to release the funds.
*   **Merger/Consolidation (Corporation Code Section 80):** BPI, as the surviving entity after the merger with BSA, assumed all liabilities and obligations of BSA, as if BPI itself incurred them.
*   **Articles of Merger:** Explicitly stated that all liabilities of BSA were transferred to BPI.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   **BPI's Liability:** BPI is liable for BSA's breach of contract. The Court voided the extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **Damages Awarded to Petitioners:**
    *   **Actual/Compensatory Damages:** P2,772,000.00 representing the difference in interest paid to other sources.
    *   **Exemplary Damages:** P100,000.00 awarded due to the bank's negligence and/or bad faith, given the importance of the banking system. *Cangungun v. Planters Development Bank, 510 Phil. 51, 65 (2005)* supports the award of exemplary damages against banks for negligence/bad faith.
    *   **Attorney's Fees:** P300,000.00 (reduced from the trial court's award).
    *   **Interest:** 6% per annum on all damages from the finality of the decision.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **"Availability of Funds" Clause:** BSA's claim that release was contingent on "availability of funds" was rejected by the Court. The Court pointed out that BSA failed to inform petitioners in advance. It raises the question of whether or not a perfected contract existed.
*   **Proof of Lost Profits:**  Petitioners' claim for unrealized profits was denied due to insufficient evidence. The Court deemed the presented purchase orders and company records as self-serving.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1170, Civil Code:**  Basis for damages due to breach of contract.
*   **Article 1934, Civil Code:** Perfection of a loan contract (delivery of the object).  Cited *Spouses Palada v. Solidbank Corporation, et al., 668 Phil. 172 (2011)*.
*   **Corporation Code, Section 80:** Effects of merger or consolidation. Establishes BPI's liability for BSA's obligations.
*   ***Development Bank of the Philippines v. Guari√±a Agricultural and Realty Development Corp., 724 Phil. 209 (2014)***: Reiterates that a debtor cannot incur delay until the creditor has fully performed its reciprocal obligation.
*   ***Metropolitan Bank v. Wong, 412 Phil. 207 (2001)***: Mandates strict compliance with the law when exercising the right to foreclose a mortgage.

**Contentious Issues:**

*   **Perfection of the Contract:** The CA incorrectly concluded that there was no perfected contract with respect to the credit line. The SC correctly identified the approval and partial release of the credit line as proof of a perfected contract.
*   **Delay:** The central point was whether BSA's delay in releasing the full credit line justified the Petitioners' subsequent refusal to pay. The court correctly held that it did.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   **Breach of Contract:** Strong argument that BSA breached the agreement.
*   **Due Diligence:** BPI's failure to investigate the underlying transactions of BSA weakens its case.
*   **Reciprocal Obligations:** Key argument is the failure of BPI/BSA to fulfill its reciprocal obligation.
