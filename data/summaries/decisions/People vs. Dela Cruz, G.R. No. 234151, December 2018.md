## Legal Document Summary: People v. Dela Cruz y Libonao, G.R. No. 234151

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, acquitting Cesar Dela Cruz of violating Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act) for illegal sale of *shabu*. The Court held that the prosecution failed to prove Dela Cruz's guilt beyond reasonable doubt due to multiple, unexplained breaches of the chain of custody rule concerning the seized drugs.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs)
*   **Core Issue:**  Chain of custody of the *corpus delicti* (methamphetamine hydrochloride) and compliance with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 Requirements:**  The apprehending team is required to immediately conduct physical inventory and photograph the seized drugs in the presence of the accused (or his representative/counsel), a representative from the media, a representative from the DOJ, and an elected public official. These witnesses must sign the inventory and receive a copy. The seized drugs must be turned over to a forensic laboratory within 24 hours.
*   **Prosecution's Obligation:** Prove beyond a reasonable doubt the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs by establishing an unbroken chain of custody. This includes accounting for each link in the chain from seizure to presentation in court.  If there is a deviation from the procedures in Section 21, the prosecution must acknowledge and justify it.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Accused's Initial Liability:** The accused was initially found guilty by the RTC and CA and sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.
*   **Prosecution's Failure:** The Supreme Court found the prosecution failed to overcome the accused's presumption of innocence due to critical breaches in procedure. The state bears the burden of proving justifiable cause for any deviation from Sec. 21 procedures.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21:** The buy-bust team failed to comply with mandatory requirements under Section 21, par. 1 of RA 9165.
    *   The drugs were not marked or photographed at the place of arrest.
    *   Required witnesses (media representative, DOJ representative) were absent at the time of seizure and apprehension. Barangay officials were only called in later.
    *   The Barangay Kagawad admitted he was not present when the inventory was prepared and merely signed a pre-prepared document.
*   **Insufficient Justification for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution's explanation for the absence of media representatives (it was "late in the night") was deemed insufficient.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:**  The Court rejected reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty, stating that the procedural lapses were affirmative proofs of irregularity.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5, Article II:**  Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs
*   **RA 9165, Section 21, Article II:**  Chain of Custody Rule for seized drugs
*   **IRR of RA 9165, Art. II, Sec. 21 (a):** Implementing Rules and Regulations

*   **People v. Jugo, G.R. No. 231792**
*   **People v. Zheng Bai Hui, 393 Phil. 68**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "saving clause" in the IRR allowing for deviations from Section 21 is not applicable here because the prosecution failed to acknowledge and justify the lapses in procedure.
*   The interpretation of "immediately after seizure and confiscation" in Section 21 and whether the subsequent actions by the buy-bust team met that standard.
*   The weight given to the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty versus the accused's constitutional right to be presumed innocent.

**Conclusion:**

The Court strongly emphasized the importance of strict compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 to preserve the integrity of drug evidence.  The prosecution's failure to adequately justify the significant deviations from this procedure led to the acquittal of the accused. This case serves as a reminder to law enforcement agencies of the importance of following proper procedures and for prosecutors to diligently prove compliance to secure convictions in drug-related cases.
