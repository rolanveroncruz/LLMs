**Legal Document Summary: White Light Corp. v. City of Manila, 596 Phil. 444 (2009)**

**Case Overview:** This Supreme Court decision invalidated Manila City Ordinance No. 7774, which prohibited "short-time admission," "short-time admission rates," and "wash-up rate schemes" in hotels, motels, inns, and similar establishments. The Court reversed the Court of Appeals and reinstated the Regional Trial Court's ruling, finding the ordinance unconstitutional.

**Key Provisions of Ordinance No. 7774:**

*   **Prohibition:** Bans short-time admission (defined as less than 12 hours or renting out rooms more than twice a day) and wash-up rates in specified establishments.
*   **Penalty:** Fine of P5,000 and/or imprisonment up to one year. Subsequent convictions result in automatic cancellation of the business license.

**Legal Arguments & Court's Reasoning:**

*   **Standing:** The Court grants the petitioners (hotel/motel operators) third-party standing to assert the rights of their patrons, citing `Powers v. Ohio` and the overbreadth doctrine. The ordinance's broad sweep affects their patrons' liberty interests, justifying their claim.
*   **Due Process Violation:** The Court applies heightened scrutiny (drawing from `U.S. v. Carolene Products` footnote 4 and expanding upon `Craig v. Boren`), because the ordinance infringes on fundamental rights to liberty and privacy. The ordinance is seen as a restriction on legitimate activities, and the means are not narrowly tailored to address the perceived problem of illicit activities.
*   **Invalid Exercise of Police Power:** The ordinance fails the test of validity for police power measures. It is oppressive, unduly interferes with private rights, and less intrusive means are available to achieve the City's objectives. There's no reasonable relation between the purpose (curbing immoral activities) and the means employed (banning short-time stays). The court relies on the principles laid out in `City of Manila v. Hon. Laguio, Jr.` and `Ermita-Malate Hotel and Motel Operations Association, Inc., v. Hon. City Mayor of Manila.`
*   **Overbreadth:** The ordinance's sweep is overly broad, prohibiting legitimate uses of short-time rentals and wash-up rates, impacting individuals with lawful purposes.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Local Government Code:** Referenced by the City of Manila as the basis for their police power, specifically Section 458 (4)(iv) regarding regulation of hotels, motels, etc.
*   **Revised Manila Charter:** Article III, Section 18(kk), also cited by the city as justification for the ordinance
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 259:** Cited by MTDC, authorizing the use of short-time basis

**Case Law Referenced:**

*   **City of Manila v. Laguio, Jr.:**  Significant precedent, affirming the nullification of a similar city ordinance restricting motels and inns. The court heavily relied on the analysis and principles outlined in this decision.
*   **Ermita-Malate Hotel and Motel Operations Association, Inc. v. Hon. City Mayor of Manila:** Distinguishes this earlier case where a patron information ordinance was upheld.
*   **Ynot v. Intermediate Appellate Court:** Used by the RTC for comparison
*   **U.S. v. Carolene Products:** Established the footnote 4 test
*   **Craig v. Boren:** Defined intermediate scrutiny
*   **Powers v. Ohio:** Third-party standing criteria
*   **Griswold v. Connecticut:** Standing of physicians to challenge reproductive health statute on behalf of patients

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Potential for Circumvention:** The Court notes the ordinance could be easily circumvented by paying the whole-day rate, rendering it ineffective in deterring illicit activities.
*   **Vagueness:** The definition of "short-time admission" could be challenged as vague, leading to inconsistent enforcement.
*   **Economic Impact:** The ordinance's potential negative impact on tourism and legitimate business operations is a factor weighed by the Court.

**Key Takeaway:**  This case reinforces the principle that local government ordinances enacted under the guise of police power must be narrowly tailored and not unduly infringe upon fundamental rights, even when pursuing legitimate goals such as promoting public morality. The case underscores the importance of balancing government power with individual liberties.
