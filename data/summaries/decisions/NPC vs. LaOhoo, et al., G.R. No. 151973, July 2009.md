Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court decision, focusing on key legal issues and potential liabilities:

**Case:** *National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR) vs. Spouses Lorenzo L. Laohoo and Visitacion Lim-Laohoo; and Luz Lomuntad-Miel*, G.R. No. 151973, July 23, 2009

**Summary:**

This case involves NAPOCOR's expropriation of land owned by the respondents for its 350 KV LEYTE-LUZON HVDC POWER TL PROJECT under R.A. No. 6395. NAPOCOR filed complaints in the RTC of Catbalogan, Samar, seeking an easement of right-of-way.  The core dispute revolves around the *finality of the RTC's order setting just compensation* and whether NAPOCOR *timely appealed* that decision.  The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision dismissing NAPOCOR's petition, finding that NAPOCOR's appeal to the RTC was filed out of time, and its subsequent Petition for Certiorari to the CA was also filed late.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Expropriation Power (R.A. 6395):**  NAPOCOR has the power to expropriate land for its projects.
*   **Just Compensation:**  NAPOCOR is obligated to pay just compensation for the expropriated land, determined by the RTC.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 41, Sec. 3: ** Mandates a 15-day period from the notice of judgment or final order to file an appeal.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 41, Sec. 4: ** Requires the appellant to pay the full amount of the appellate court docket and other lawful fees within the appeal period.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65, Sec. 4:** Regulates that an appeal to file a petition for certiorari must be filed within a 60-day period.

**Liabilities:**

*   **NAPOCOR is liable for paying the amount of just compensation** set by the RTC (P2,000.00 per square meter), as the judgment became final and executory due to the untimely appeal.
*   **Potential Liability for legal costs and expenses** incurred by the respondents due to the prolonged litigation.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Judgment:**  The primary risk is the *finality of the RTC judgment* on just compensation. NAPOCOR is bound to pay that amount, and the Court rejected its attempts to lower it.
*   **No Appellate Review of Just Compensation:** The Supreme Court did not review the *merits of the just compensation determination*, holding that it was a question of fact and cannot be reviewed due to the procedural errors in appealing. NAPOCOR is stuck with the RTC's valuation.
*   **Reliance on Counsel:**  NAPOCOR is *bound by the mistakes of its counsel* (Atty. Neon Cinco) regarding the timely filing of the appeal. The Court rejected arguments that the Regional Legal Counsel's late receipt of the Order should be controlling or that the OSG's lack of notice extended the appeal period. This highlights the importance of proper communication and monitoring by the client of its legal representation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6395, Sec. 2:**  Defines NAPOCOR's mandate and power to expropriate.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 41, Sec. 3:** Regulates the period for ordinary appeal.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65, Sec. 4:** Regulates the period for filling a petition for certiorari
*    ***Neypes v. Court of Appeals,*** Standardized the appeal periods provided in the rules in order to afford litigants a fair opportunity to appeal their cases,
*   ***National Power Corporation v. Vine Development Corporation:*** Affirmed the authority of National Power Corporation's lawyers to file notices of appeal of adverse decisions rendered by the trial courts.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Date of Receipt of RTC Order:** The date of receipt by NAPOCOR's counsel (Atty. Cinco) of the RTC Order denying the Motion for Reconsideration was a key factual dispute. The RTC's finding that it was received on October 15, 1997, was upheld due to NAPOCOR's failure to disprove it with certified records.
*   **Role of Deputized Counsel vs. OSG:**  NAPOCOR argued that the OSG's lack of notice should extend the appeal period. The Court rejected this, citing *Republic v. Soriano* and emphasizing that service on the deputized attorney (Atty. Cinco) is service on the OSG.

**Conclusion:**

This case serves as a cautionary tale regarding procedural compliance in appeals. NAPOCOR's failure to perfect its appeal on time resulted in the finality of the RTC's judgment on just compensation, leaving NAPOCOR liable for the full amount and without recourse for appellate review of the valuation. This highlights the importance of meticulous attention to deadlines and effective communication between clients and counsel.
