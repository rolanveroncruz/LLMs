**Case:** *Sime Darby Pilipinas, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission (2nd Division) and Sime Darby Salaried Employees Association (ALU-TUCP)*, G.R. No. 119205, April 15, 1998

**Summary:**

This case concerns whether a company's change in employee work schedule, eliminating a paid 30-minute "on-call" lunch break and replacing it with an unpaid one-hour lunch break, constitutes unfair labor practice (ULP) under the Labor Code. The Supreme Court (SC) ruled in favor of Sime Darby Pilipinas, Inc. (the employer), finding that the change was a valid exercise of management prerogative and did not constitute ULP.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Management Prerogative:** The SC affirmed the employer's right to fix work schedules for efficient business operations (citing *San Miguel Brewery Sales Force v. Ople*, G.R. No. 53515). This includes the right to change working hours (*Union Carbide Labor Union v. Union Carbide Phils., Inc.*, G.R. No. 41314).
*   **Article 100, Labor Code (Diminution of Benefits):** The NLRC initially held that the change violated Art. 100 by diminishing a time-honored company practice (paid lunch break). The SC reversed this, holding that because the employees were free of work responsibilities during the entire one-hour lunch break, there was no unjust diminution of benefits.
*   **Daily Work Period:** The SC determined that the new work schedule complied with the eight-hour daily work period requirement under the Labor Code.
*   **Unfair Labor Practice (ULP):** The SC found no evidence that the change in schedule prejudiced the union's right to self-organization or that it was discriminatory because it applied to all similarly situated employees (citing *NLU v. Insular Yebana Co.*, L-15363).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Sime Darby International Tire Co., Inc. v. NLRC*** (G.R. No. 87838, 26 February 1990): The NLRC initially relied on this case. However, the SC distinguished it, noting that the prior case involved discriminatory lunch break practices between different groups of employees. That is, some employees were paid for their lunch breaks and others were not.
*   ***San Miguel Brewery Sales Force v. Ople*** (G.R. No. 53515): Affirms management prerogative to regulate aspects of employment.
*   ***Union Carbide Labor Union v. Union Carbide Phils., Inc.*** (G.R. No. 41314): Affirms managements prerogative to change working hours.
*   ***NLU v. Insular Yebana Co.*** (L-15363): Addresses managerial authority and the rights of the employer.
*   ***Abbot Laboratories v. NLRC, 154 S 713***
*   ***Cruz v. Medina, G.R. No. 73053***

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Good Faith" Requirement:** The SC emphasizes that management prerogatives must be exercised in "good faith" and not to circumvent employee rights.  A potential risk is that the union could later argue that the change in work schedule was a pretext for some other unlawful motive, such as union busting. If the union were able to prove that there was an ulterior motive, this could reverse the courts decision in the matter.
*   **Definition of "On-Call":** The term "on-call" and the nature of the work performed during the previous paid lunch break are fact-specific. A future dispute could arise if the employer attempts to reintroduce an "on-call" element without proper compensation.
*   **Article 100 Enforcement:** While the SC ruled there was no violation of Article 100, the specific facts and circumstances will be crucial in any future challenges based on alleged diminution of benefits. If there were elements of required work that were not properly compensated, the finding could change.
*   **Future CBA Negotiations:** This decision provides management with a strong precedent for altering work schedules, but the union may attempt to restrict this prerogative in future collective bargaining agreements (CBAs).

**Conclusion:**

The SC decision supports the employer's right to modify work schedules for legitimate business reasons, provided it is done in good faith, complies with minimum labor standards, and does not discriminate against employees. The key to this outcome was the finding that the new one-hour lunch break provided employees with a genuine, uninterrupted break from work.
