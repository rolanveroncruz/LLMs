## Legal Document Summary - *Tacloban Far East Marketing Corporation v. CA & Sabulao* (G.R. No. 182320)

**Case Summary:** This case involves a petition for review on certiorari filed by Tacloban Far East Marketing Corporation ("TFEMC") and Francisco Romualdez ("Romualdez") assailing the Court of Appeals' ("CA") decision affirming the National Labor Relations Commission's ("NLRC") finding that Benjamin Sabulao ("Sabulao") was illegally dismissed.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **TFEMC/Romualdez's Argument:** Sabulao abandoned his employment, citing frequent absences and engagement in "Ukay-Ukay" business. They allege the CA misappreciated evidence. Also the issue of Sabulao being a field personnel was only raised before the Court of Appeals.
*   **Sabulao's Argument:** He was dismissed after requesting leave due to a family death. Filed a complaint for illegal dismissal which negates abandonment.
*   **Labor Arbiter Decision (Initial):** Found abandonment, but ordered payment of salary differentials and service incentive leave pay.
*   **NLRC Decision:** Reversed the Labor Arbiter, finding illegal dismissal. Ordered backwages, separation pay, salary differentials, and service incentive leave pay.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the NLRC, holding that filing the illegal dismissal complaint negates abandonment.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Denied TFEMC's petition for lack of merit, due to utilizing wrong mode of remedy (petition for certiorari instead of review) and was also filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period and the late filing cannot be excused. Even if court allowed present petition for certiorari, still would be dismissible for lack of grave abuse of discretion.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **TFEMC/Romualdez:** Liable for backwages, separation pay, salary differentials, and service incentive leave pay to Sabulao, totaling P238,157.99.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **For TFEMC/Romualdez:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA and NLRC decisions, therefore, they remain liable for monetary awards for Sabulao.
*   **General Risk (Abandonment Defense):** Employer bears the burden of proving abandonment with both unjustified absence and clear intent to sever the employment relationship. *Macahilig v. National Labor Relations Commission* (G.R. No. 158095) and *Hermogenes v. Osco Shipping Services, Inc.* (G.R. No. 141505) cited.
*   **General Risk (Appeal):** The proper recourse of an aggrieved party is to file a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Abandonment vs. Illegal Dismissal:** The core issue is whether Sabulao abandoned his employment (per TFEMC) or was illegally dismissed (per Sabulao). The CA's ruling that filing an illegal dismissal complaint negates abandonment is a key point.
*   **Field Personnel:** The argument that Sabulao is field personnel was only raised on appeal and thus dismissed by the SC.
*   **Delay in Filing:** The three-month delay in filing the case is not an indication of abandonment.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45, Section 1:** Procedure for petition for review on certiorari.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65, Section 1:** Procedure for petition for certiorari.
