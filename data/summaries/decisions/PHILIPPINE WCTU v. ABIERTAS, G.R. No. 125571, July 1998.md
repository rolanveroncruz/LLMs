## Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Womanâ€™s Christian Temperance Union, Inc. vs. Abiertas House of Friendship, Inc., & Radiance School, Inc.* (G.R. No. 125571, July 22, 1998)

**Core Issue:** Whether the RTC judge erred in dismissing the PWCTU's complaint for recovery of possession based on *litis pendentia* and forum shopping due to a prior SEC petition.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Restriction on Title (TCT No. 209770 T-2270):** Property to be used as a site for "Abiertas House of Friendship," a home for needy women/girls and children.
*   **Lease Contract (May 24, 1995):** AHFI leased portions of the property to RSI to operate a grade school. PWCTU alleges this was done without its consent, rendering the contract null and void.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **AHFI:** Alleged obligation to adhere to the title restriction and obtain PWCTU's consent for the lease. Potential liability for damages and back rentals if the lease is deemed invalid. Questionable Power to lease out the property it doesnt own.
*   **RSI:** Alleged obligation to vacate the premises and pay reasonable compensation for use. Potential liability for damages and back rentals if the lease is deemed invalid.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **RTC Dismissal Reversed:** The Supreme Court reversed the RTC's dismissal, finding no *litis pendentia* or forum shopping. The case is remanded to the RTC.
*   **Invalid Lease:** If the RTC determines the lease is invalid due to lack of PWCTU's consent or violation of the title restriction, AHFI and RSI could be held liable for damages and ordered to vacate.
*   **Ultra Vires Act by AHFI:** Although the SEC petition regarding AHFI's alleged ultra vires act of operating a school was withdrawn, the issue could resurface and impact AHFI's corporate powers.
*    **Proprietary Interest of the Property:** PWCTU must prove its lack of consent.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Litis Pendentia (Rule 16, Sec. 1(e)):** *Northcott & Co. vs. Villa-Abrille, 41 Phil 462*; *Arceo vs. Oliveros, et. al. L-38251, Jan. 31, 1985*; *Teodoro vs. Mirasol, 53 O.G. 80888*; *Magsaysay vs. Magsaysay, et. al. L-49847, July 17, 1980*. The Court emphasizes the requirement for identity of parties, rights asserted, and reliefs prayed for.
*   **Forum Shopping (Supreme Court Administrative Circular 04-94):** *First Philippine International Bank vs. Court of Appeals, 252 SCRA 259, January 24, 1996*; *Buan vs. Lopez, 145 SCRA 34, October 13, 1986*. Focuses on identical issues and the applicability of *res judicata*.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of the Lease Contract:** The validity hinges on whether PWCTU's consent was required and obtained, and whether the school's operation violates the title restriction. The facts need to be established in the trial court.
*   **Corporate Powers of AHFI:** The SEC Petition withdrawal doesn't necessarily extinguish the question of whether AHFI exceeded its corporate powers by engaging in the school business. This could affect future actions by AHFI.

**Summary of Court's Reasoning:**

The Court found that the RTC erred because the SEC Petition and the RTC Complaint involved different rights asserted and reliefs prayed for. The SEC Petition focused on AHFI's ultra vires act of operating a school, while the RTC Complaint centered on the validity of the lease contract and the right to possession based on property ownership. The court concluded that a judgment in one case would not be *res judicata* in the other, and that PWCTU was not guilty of forum shopping.
