**Case Summary: People v. Cabuhay, G.R. No. 225590, July 23, 2018**

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming a RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (illegal sale of dangerous drugs). The accused was acquitted of illegal possession.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs):** The central issue is whether the prosecution proved the elements of illegal sale beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Chain of Custody Rule:** The Supreme Court (SC) focused on the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized *shabu*, a requirement to ensure the integrity and identity of the corpus delicti (the drug itself). This is tied to the prosecution's burden of proving every link in the chain, from seizure to presentation in court.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21 (Custody and Disposition of Confiscated Drugs):** The buy-bust team's non-compliance with the mandatory procedural requirements of Section 21, specifically the physical inventory and photographing of the drugs immediately after seizure *in the presence of the accused (or representative), media representative, DOJ representative, and an elected public official*, was a critical flaw. The SC emphasized that the absence of these witnesses' signatures on the inventory cast doubt on the integrity of the seized evidence. *People v. Jaafar, G.R. No. 219829, 18 January 2017, 815 SCRA 19, 33.*
*   **Stipulation of Forensic Chemist Testimony:** While the defense stipulated to the testimony of the forensic chemist, PCI Ebuen, the stipulations were deemed insufficient because they did not cover the precautionary steps taken by the chemist to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item after examination (e.g., resealing and marking). *People v. Pajarin, 654 Phil. 461, 466 (2011).* Failure to include how it was managed, stored, preserved, labeled and recorded from the time of its seizure, to its receipt by the forensic laboratory, up until it was presented in court and subsequently destroyed is absent from the evidence adduced during the trial. *People v. Sanchez, 590 Phil. 214-245 (2008).*

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Burden:** The prosecution has a strict burden to prove the *corpus delicti* (the drug) beyond a reasonable doubt, requiring meticulous adherence to the chain of custody rule.
*   **Police Obligations:** Law enforcement officers have a mandatory obligation to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165, including the inventory and photographing of seized drugs in the presence of required witnesses.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Procedural Lapses:** Any deviation from the prescribed procedures under Section 21 of RA 9165 can be fatal to the prosecution's case, especially when no justifiable grounds for non-compliance are presented.
*   **Insufficient Stipulations:** Stipulations regarding the forensic chemist's testimony must explicitly cover the handling and preservation of the drug both before and *after* the laboratory examination. The failure to stipulate all the steps taken could lead to a reasonable doubt, even if the results of the examination are stipulated.

**Outcome:** The SC reversed the CA and RTC decisions, acquitting Cabuhay due to the prosecution's failure to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on a broken chain of custody.
