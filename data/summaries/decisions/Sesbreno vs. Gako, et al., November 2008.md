## Summary of A.M. No. RTJ-08-2144

This is an administrative matter concerning Judge Ireneo L. Gako, Jr. and Clerk of Court Manuel G. Nollora of RTC Branch 5, Cebu City. The complaint, filed by Atty. Raul H. Sesbre√±o, alleged undue delay in resolving a Motion for Reconsideration, acting on a case after inhibition, and incompetence.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Undue Delay:** Judge Gako failed to resolve a Motion for Reconsideration within the constitutionally mandated 90-day period (Art. VIII, Sec. 15 of the Constitution). This violates Rule 3.05, Canon 3 and Rule 1.02, Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, as well as SC Administrative Circular No. 13-87.
*   **Acting After Inhibition:** Judge Gako acted on a motion despite a prior order inhibiting himself from the case, potentially violating Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct which requires avoiding the appearance of impropriety.
*   **Incompetence:** Both Judge Gako and Clerk Nollora were charged with incompetence for failing to keep case records intact. Only 16 of 72 volumes were turned over. This implicates Section 7, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court and the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court regarding safekeeping of records.
*   **Failure to Comply with OCA Directives:** Judge Gako repeatedly failed to respond to directives from the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), necessitating a show-cause order from the Supreme Court.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judges' Duty to Timely Resolution:** Judges are obligated to decide cases within the prescribed timeframe and act promptly on motions. Failure constitutes undue delay.
*   **Clerks' Duty to Safeguard Records:** Clerks of Court are responsible for the safekeeping of court records and maintaining an efficient record management system.
*   **Obligation to Comply with OCA/Court Directives:** Judges are obligated to respond to directives from the Supreme Court and the OCA.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Philippine Constitution, Art. VIII, Sec. 15:** Mandates decision within 3 months for lower courts.
*   **Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 3.05, Canon 3 & Rule 1.02, Canon 2:** Addresses prompt disposition of cases and impartial administration of justice.
*   **SC Administrative Circular Nos. 13-87 & 1-88:** Provide administrative guidelines for prompt disposition of judicial business.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 136, Section 7:** Duty of clerk of court to keep records.
*   **2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court:** Outlines duties of clerks of court.
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (Rule IV, Sec. 52(B)):** Sets penalty for simple neglect of duty.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **Voluntary Inhibition Justification:** Judge Gako's rationale that voluntary inhibition granted him discretion to disregard the order is legally questionable.
*   **Incomplete Records:** The Clerk of Court's claim that he didn't request missing volumes due to perceived irrelevance and storage limitations could be seen as negligence and creates a potential chain of custody issue for the case records.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** Judge Gako's medical condition (mild stroke) was considered mitigating but did not excuse his non-compliance.
*   **Penalty Considerations:** The court reduced the penalty to a fine instead of suspension for Clerk Nollora to avoid disruption of court operations. This highlights the discretionary power of the court in determining sanctions.

**Outcome:**

*   Judge Gako was found GUILTY of undue delay and violation of Court directives and fined P30,000 to be deducted from his retirement benefits.
*   Clerk Nollora was found GUILTY of simple neglect of duty and fined one month's salary with a warning.
