## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Martin & Tanoan*, G.R. No. 177571

**Case:** Appeal of CA decision affirming RTC conviction for murder under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions:**

*   Accused-Appellants Dean Martin and Romeo Tanoan were convicted of Murder for the stabbing death of Rogelio Dihan.
*   Tanoan directly stabbed the victim.
*   Martin blocked the victim's wife from seeking help during the commission of the crime.
*   The CA affirmed the conviction finding Conspiracy between the accused.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:**  Both Accused-Appellants are sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* for the crime of murder.

    *   PhP 25,000 Temperate Damages (in lieu of unproven actual damages)
    *   PhP 25,000 Exemplary Damages
    *   Costs of Suit.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Identification Issues:**  Appellants challenged the credibility of eyewitness identification, alleging suggestive police lineup and delayed reporting.  The Court found these arguments unpersuasive, citing positive identification by witnesses and affirming the trial court's assessment of credibility.
*   **Alibi Defense:** The Court rejected Martin's alibi defense, holding that he failed to prove physical impossibility of being at the crime scene, per *People v. Sumalinog Jr.*
*   **Conspiracy:** The Court inferred conspiracy from Martin's actions (blocking the wife), even without direct proof, relying on *People v. Bulan* and *People v. Abes*.
*   **Hearsay:** While mentioned as an issue by the defendants, the Court focused on the eyewitness testimonies and did not substantially address any hearsay arguments.
