**Case Summary: Limbona v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 181097**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari challenging COMELEC Resolutions disqualifying Petitioner Limbona from running for Mayor of Pantar, Lanao del Norte based on residency requirements.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Residency Requirement (Sec. 73, Omnibus Election Code):** The central issue is whether Limbona met the one-year residency requirement for mayoralty candidates. The COMELEC ruled she did not, finding her domicile of origin (Maguing, Lanao del Sur) and marital domicile (Marawi City) were not abandoned in favor of Pantar. The court referenced *Gallego v. Verra* (73 Phil 453) defining residence in election law as synonymous with domicile.
*   **Withdrawal of Certificate of Candidacy:** Limbona initially filed a certificate, withdrew it, and then re-filed as a substitute. COMELEC's approval of the initial withdrawal did not negate the legal effects arising from the initial filing, specifically its power to decide on the validity of her qualifications at the time of filing.  Cited *Monroy v. Court of Appeals* (127 Phil. 1) on effects of filing a certificate of candidacy.
*   **COMELEC's Authority Post-Election (R.A. No. 6646, Sec. 6):** The Electoral Reforms Law grants COMELEC authority to try and decide disqualification cases even after elections, as highlighted in *Frivaldo v. Commission on Elections* (327 Phil. 521). This overrides any argument that the issue became moot after the election.
*   **Substitution:** COMELEC giving due course to Limbona's substitute candidacy did not preclude them from ruling on her disqualification. The standard for "giving due course" differs from determining if a candidate is disqualified.
*   **Family Code Impact:** The Court considered Articles 68 and 69 of the Family Code regarding marital domicile, presuming Limbona's residence followed her husband's until proven otherwise, citing *Abella v. Comelec, G.R. Nos. 100710 & 100739*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Obligation to Meet Residency Requirements:** Candidates must prove they meet residency requirements to be eligible for office.  Self-serving affidavits are insufficient.
*   **COMELEC's Duty:** COMELEC is obligated to determine a candidate's qualifications, even after elections, based on legal standards.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Inability to Hold Office:** Disqualification results in removal from office.
*   **Succession:** Disqualification doesn't automatically result in the losing candidate assuming office. Succession rules under the Local Government Code (Section 44) apply, with the Vice-Mayor succeeding as Mayor.
*   **Challenge to Residency:** Residency claims are fact-intensive and vulnerable to challenge if supporting evidence is weak and based on the candidate's testimony alone.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the Family Code's presumption of shared marital domicile could be contested if strong evidence of separate residences exists.
*   Whether the evidence presented sufficiently proves "animus manendi" (intent to remain) and "animus non revertendi" (intent to abandon old domicile) in Pantar is a fact-specific determination that could be debated based on evidence.
