## Legal Document Summary: Chris Garments Corporation vs. Sto. Tomas

This case (G.R. No. 167426, January 12, 2009) involves a petition for certiorari filed by Chris Garments Corporation (Petitioner) assailing the Court of Appeals' dismissal of its petition regarding a certification election order by the Secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment (SOLE). The SOLE had reversed the Med-Arbiter's dismissal of Chris Garments Workers Union-PTGWO (Respondent Union)'s third petition for certification election and ordered one to be held.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Certification Election:** The central issue revolves around the validity of the SOLE's order for a certification election among the rank-and-file employees of Chris Garments, involving the Respondent Union and the existing union, SMCGC-SUPER, as choices.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** The CA dismissed the petition for failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration of the SOLE's decision. The SC clarifies that under Department Order No. 40-03, a Motion for Reconsideration is *not* permitted from a SOLE decision in certification election cases, making the filing of Certiorari the appropriate remedy (Rule VIII, Section 21).
*   **Res Judicata/Conclusiveness of Judgment:** Petitioner argues the case is barred by res judicata (specifically, "bar by prior judgment" and "conclusiveness of judgment") based on prior dismissed petitions. The SC finds no identity of causes of action between the first petition (dismissed because it was filed outside the 60-day freedom period) and the third petition.
*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** Petitioner claims the union members are not direct employees. The SOLE previously ruled (and petitioner did not appeal) that an employer-employee relationship *does* exist. The SC invoked "conclusiveness of judgment" preventing relitigation of this resolved issue.
*   **Department Order No. 40-03:** Specifically impacts the procedural aspect, regarding the prohibition of motions for reconsideration from SOLE decisions on certification election cases.
* **Labor Code Article 232:** Relates to the 'contract bar rule' prohibiting certification election petitions during the term of a valid Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), except during the 60-day freedom period.

**Obligations:**

*   The employer (Chris Garments) was ordered by the SOLE to submit a certified list of employees in the bargaining unit to the Regional Office.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   The certification election order stands, potentially leading to a change in the bargaining representative of the employees.
*   The SOLE's finding of an employer-employee relationship, which was not appealed by the Petitioner in the relevant timeframe, and is therefore binding.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The document cites several cases regarding res judicata and the necessity of motions for reconsideration, including *Abacan, Jr. v. Northwestern University, Inc.*, *Indiana Aerospace University v. Commission on Higher Education*, *Santos v. Cruz*, *Mallion v. Alcantara*, *Parayno v. Jovellanos*, *Heirs of Rolando N. Abadilla v. Galarosa*, *Oropeza Marketing Corporation v. Allied Banking Corporation*, and *Rasdas v. Estenor*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of whether workers are direct employees of the company or employees of independent contractors can be contentious, particularly regarding the element of control exercised by the company.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the SOLE's order for a certification election. The Court's decision hinged on procedural issues (the inappropriateness of a motion for reconsideration), the lack of res judicata, and the binding nature of the earlier finding regarding employer-employee relationship.

**Note:** A certification election was held where the other union (SMCGC-SUPER) won the certification. The finality of the decision could be said to have had mooted the original petition.
