Here's a concise legal summary of the *Bahia Shipping Services, Inc. v. Reynaldo Chua* (G.R. No. 162195, April 8, 2008) case:

**Case Summary:**

This case involves a seafarer, Reynaldo Chua, who was allegedly illegally dismissed by Bahia Shipping Services, Inc. The core issue is the legality of the dismissal and the resulting monetary awards. The Supreme Court partially granted the petition, modifying the Court of Appeals (CA) decision regarding the computation of the seafarer's salary for the unexpired portion of his contract.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Employment Contract:** Chua had a POEA-approved 9-month contract as a waiter on a cruise ship.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Chua was dismissed for allegedly being late for work (one instance of 1.5 hours late, no evidence of it being habitual)
*   **RA 8042, Section 10:** This law (Migrant Workers Act) governs the remedies for illegally dismissed overseas workers. It dictates the calculation of back wages, specifically addressing the unexpired portion of the employment contract.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Bahia Shipping Services, Inc. (and its principal, Blackfriars Shipping Co., Ltd.):** Found jointly and severally liable for illegal dismissal, back wages, illegal deductions ("union dues"), differential pay (underpayment of wages), and attorney's fees.

**Monetary Awards:**

*   **Salary for Unexpired Portion of Contract:** Initially limited to 3 months by the Labor Arbiter (LA) and affirmed by the NLRC but was later deleted by the CA. Supreme Court ultimately ruled for full unexpired duration but only based on the basic monthly salary.
*   **Reimbursement/Refund of Plane Fare:** US$638.99
*   **Illegal Deductions (“Union Dues”):** US$100.00
*   **Differential Pay (Underpayment of Wages):** US$550.00
*   **Attorney's Fees:** 10% of total monetary award.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Calculation of Back Wages:** The application of Section 10 of RA 8042 concerning salaries for the unexpired portion of the contract was a primary point of contention. The CA's lifting of the 3-month cap, despite the respondent not appealing, was challenged. The Supreme Court upheld the CA's ruling based on equity and substantive rights, applying the full unexpired term because the contract was less than one year.
*   **Inclusion of Overtime Pay:** The inclusion of "guaranteed overtime" pay in the computation of the unexpired portion of the contract was challenged. The Supreme Court found this improper, citing *Stolt-Nielsen Marine Services (Phils.), Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission* and *Cagampan v. National Labor Relations Commission*, because overtime entitlement must be proven.
*   **Habitual Tardiness:** Petitioner's claim of habitual tardiness was not supported by evidence, and it was too late to introduce supporting documents.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8042, Section 10 (Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipino Workers Act of 1995):**  Crucial provision governing monetary compensation for illegally dismissed OFWs.
*   ***Stolt-Nielsen Marine Services (Phils.), Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission; Cagampan v. National Labor Relations Commission***: Cases cited regarding the requirements for entitlement to overtime pay.
*   ***Marsaman Manning Agency, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission***: Case cited regarding the interpretation of Section 10 of RA 8042 (the 3 month salary cap).
*   ***Acebedo Optical v. National Labor Relations Commission***:  Regarding deference to labor officials' factual findings when supported by substantial evidence.
*   ***St. Michael's Institute v. Santos***: Addressing when appellate courts can grant affirmative relief even without an appeal, particularly concerning substantive rights.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The contract did not specify or define parameters related to lateness in reporting for duties.
* The basis of the "addendum to the collective bargaining agreement" that reduced his monthly salary to US$300.00 remains questionable.
* The claim of being a member of AMOSUP or the ITF to justify its claim to deduct the said union dues was not substantiated.

**Legal Precision:**

The Court ultimately held that the dismissal was illegal because the single incident of tardiness was insufficient grounds for termination. While typically, a party cannot be granted affirmative relief without appealing, the Court invoked equity and substantive rights under labor law to ensure the respondent received full compensation for the unexpired portion of his contract as mandated by RA 8042, but without the overtime inclusion.
