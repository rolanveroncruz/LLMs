**Analysis:**

The Court upheld the claim of executive privilege, specifically recognizing the diplomatic negotiations privilege, even after the agreement has been signed and made public. The decision emphasizes the Executive's need for confidentiality in diplomatic negotiations to ensure effective representation of the nation's interests. Though the court recognized the importance of transparency, it held that diplomatic negotiations are presumptively privileged, and the petitioners did not demonstrate a compelling enough public interest to overcome that privilege.

In its ruling, the court emphasizes the "sufficient showing of need" test, which requires those seeking information to demonstrate a public interest strong enough to outweigh the privilege's purpose.

The court also recognized that the Executive branch failed to explicitly state that they were claiming the privilege, however it was ultimately deemed unnessecary for the outcome of the case.

Finally, the dissenting opinion from the Chief Justice highlights the importance of transparency and the citizen's right to information in a democratic society, particularly concerning economic agreements, emphasizing that the requirements for demonstrating "need" should not unduly restrict the exercise of constitutional rights.
