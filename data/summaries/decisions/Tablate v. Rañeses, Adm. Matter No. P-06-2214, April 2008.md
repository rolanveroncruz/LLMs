**Case:** *Tablate v. Ra単eses*, A.M. No. P-06-2214, April 16, 2008.

**Summary:** This is an administrative case against Sheriff Ra単eses for simple neglect of duty relating to a writ of execution. Complainant Tablate alleges the sheriff failed to execute a writ for over two years, preventing recovery of a P300,000 civil indemnity.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sheriff's Duty:** The Court reiterates the mandatory and ministerial duty of sheriffs to execute writs of execution with reasonable alacrity. *Vargas v. Primo, A.M. No. P-07-2336, January 24, 2008*; *Cebu International Finance Corporation v. Cabigon, A.M. No. P-06-2107, February 14, 2007*; *Patawaran v. Nepomuceno, A.M. No. P-02-1655, February 6, 2007*. Lack of "follow-up" from the prevailing party is *not* an excuse. *Santuyo v. Benito, A.M. No. P-05-1997, August 3, 2006*; *Legaspi v. Tobillo, A.M. No. P-05-1978, March 31, 2005*; *Mendoza v. Sheriff IV Tuquero, 412 Phil. 435, 441 (2001)*.
*   **Reporting Requirements (Rule 39, Sec. 14; Administrative Circular No. 12):** Sheriffs must provide periodic reports to the court, including monthly progress reports, regarding the status of writ execution.  The returns or periodic reports shall set forth the whole of the proceedings taken, and shall be filed with the court and copies thereof promptly furnished the parties.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Simple Neglect of Duty:** The Court finds Ra単eses guilty of simple neglect of duty for failure to diligently enforce the writ and comply with reporting requirements.  Simple neglect is defined as failure to give attention to a task expected of him and signifies a disregard of a duty resulting from carelessness or indifference.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Justification for Delay:** The Sheriff argued he was awaiting instructions from complainant, but this was rejected by the Court as insufficient justification. A diligent execution is not contingent on explicit instigation.
*   **Lack of Diligence:** Long periods of inaction between investigative steps evidenced a clear lack of diligence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 14, Revised Rules of Court:** Mandates return of writ of execution and reporting requirements.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 12, October 1, 1985:** Outlines sheriff's responsibility to speedily and efficiently serve court processes.
*   **Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Defines simple neglect of duty and associated penalties.

**Outcome:** The Court fines Ra単eses one month's salary, with a stern warning. The lack of prior disciplinary actions appears to mitigate the penalty.

**Legal Analysis & Concerns:** This case highlights the crucial role of sheriffs in enforcing court orders and emphasizes that their duties are mandatory, irrespective of the prevailing party's actions. The judgment reinforces the principle that sheriffs will be held accountable for delays in execution and failure to adhere to reporting requirements. The potential concern arises if the fine is insufficient to deter similar conduct in the future by this, or other sheriffs, given the financial implications for the injured party seeking execution.
