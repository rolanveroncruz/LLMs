## Legal Document Summary: *Board of Investments v. SR Metals, Inc.* G.R. No. 219927 (2018)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court decision on a petition for review on certiorari, concerning the withdrawal of Income Tax Holiday (ITH) incentive granted by the Board of Investments (BOI) to SR Metals, Inc. (SR Metals).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **ITH Incentive:** SR Metals was granted an ITH for 2008-2012 as a new producer of beneficiated nickel ore under the Omnibus Investment Code (EO 226).
*   **BOI Obligations:**  To promote investments (RA 5186), implement the Omnibus Investments Code (EO 226), and determine compliance with the Investment Priorities Plan (IPP).
*   **SR Metals' Obligations:** To comply with the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Registration and the 2007 IPP, including:
    *   Establishing a new line/beneficiation plant (contentious).
    *   Infusing new investment in fixed assets.
    *   Submitting progress reports.
    *   Adhering to project timetable.
*   **Cancellation Procedure:** The 2004 BOI Revised Rules of Procedure on Cancellation of Registration (Rule II, Sections 1-4) outline the steps for initiating and implementing cancellation proceedings.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **BOI Liability:** Erroneous withdrawal of incentives could lead to legal challenges and potential damages. BOI must follow due process requirements.
*   **SR Metals' Liability:** Failure to comply with the terms of registration could result in withdrawal of incentives, penalties, and potential refund of incentives already enjoyed.
*   **Risk of Ambiguity:** The term "beneficiation plant" is ambiguous, leading to disputes regarding SR Metals' obligations. The level of detail required in progress reports could also be a point of contention.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Beneficiation Plant":** Whether a physical structure is required, or if an assemblage of equipment is sufficient.  SR Metals argues its beneficiation process, not physical plant, was the basis for registration. The BOI contends that SR Metals promised a physical plant.
*   **"New Facility" Definition:**  The IPP defines "new facility" as "the space or area, physical structure and equipment provided for a particular purpose or segment of the production process/service activity."  The interpretation of this definition is central to the dispute.
*   **Due Process:** While the court found that the SR Metals was given due process, the Court cautioned that the rules of procedure cannot be brushed aside. However, SR Metals argued that BOI failed to follow the cancellation procedure under the 2004 BOI Revised Rules of Procedure.

**Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court denied the BOI's petition, affirming the CA's decision to reinstate SR Metals' ITH incentive. The Court found that SR Metals complied with the terms of registration, made substantial investments, and submitted progress reports. The Court deferred to SR Metals' interpretation that it committed to a beneficiation *process*, rather than constructing a new industrial building.

**Dissenting Opinion (Leonen, J.):**

Argued that the BOI's withdrawal of the ITH should have been upheld. The dissent emphasized the BOI's expertise in administering investment incentives and interpreting its own regulations.  The dissent contended that the construction of a beneficiation plant was a crucial component of the requirements for being classified as a new project, and that the BOI was best positioned to determine whether the requirements of the 2007 IPP were met.
