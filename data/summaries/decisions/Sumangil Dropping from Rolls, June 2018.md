**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 18-04-79-RTC**

**Nature:** Administrative Matter regarding the dropping from the rolls of Florante B. Sumangil, Clerk III, RTC Pasay City, Branch 119, due to Absence Without Official Leave (AWOL).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Dropping from the Rolls:** Sumangil is dropped from the rolls effective December 1, 2017, due to being AWOL since that date. This action is based on Section 107(a)(1), Rule 20 of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (2017 RACCS).
*   **Declaration of Vacancy:** Sumangil's position is declared vacant.
*   **Right to Appeal:** Sumangil has the right to appeal his separation within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the notice of separation (Section 107(a)(1), Rule 20, 2017 RACCS). The notice must be sent to his last known address.
*   **Benefits & Reemployment:**  Sumangil remains qualified to receive benefits he may be entitled to under existing laws and can be reemployed in the government (Section 110, Rule 20, 2017 RACCS). Dropping from the rolls is explicitly considered non-disciplinary.

**Liabilities:**

*   Sumangil's prolonged absences are deemed to have caused inefficiency in public service.
*   His actions are considered a disregard and neglect of his duties as a public servant.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Appeal:**  Sumangil may appeal the dropping from the rolls. The success of this appeal will depend on whether he can provide a valid justification for his absence or demonstrate that the procedural requirements for dropping from the rolls were not properly followed.
*   **Notice:** Ensuring proper service of the resolution to Sumangil's last known address is crucial to the validity of the dropping from the rolls and to trigger the 15-day appeal period. Failure to properly notify could be grounds for a successful appeal.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (2017 RACCS):** Section 107(a)(1), Rule 20, provides the authority for dropping employees from the rolls for being AWOL. Section 110, Rule 20, clarifies that such action is non-disciplinary.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Last Known Address:**  The effectiveness of the notice provision hinges on the accuracy and verification of Sumangil's "last known address."  If the address on file is not current, there could be challenges to the validity of the notice and subsequent dropping from the rolls.
*   **Determination of Benefits:** While Sumangil retains entitlement to benefits, the specific calculation and determination of those benefits may become a source of contention.
