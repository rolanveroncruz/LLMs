**Legal Document Summary: *Maunlad Homes, Inc. vs. Union Bank of the Philippines***

**Case:** G.R. No. 179898, December 23, 2008

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioners:** Maunlad Homes, Inc., N.C. Pulumbarit Inc., N.C.P. Leasing Corporation, and Nemencio C. Pulumbarit, Sr.
*   **Respondents:** Union Bank of the Philippines and Julie C. Go

**Subject Matter:** Dispute over the right to collect rental payments from tenants of Maunlad Malls 1 and 2, previously owned and mortgaged by Petitioners to Respondents, foreclosed by Respondents, and subsequently subject of a Contract to Sell between the parties.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Contract to Sell (Buy-Back Agreement):** Petitioners (buyer) and Respondents (seller) entered into a contract to sell the foreclosed properties, essentially a buy-back agreement with installment payments.
*   **Preliminary Injunction:** RTC issued a preliminary injunction preventing Respondents from collecting rental payments directly from the tenants and interfering with Petitioners' possession and management.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals reversed the RTC's grant of preliminary injunction.
*   **SC Decision:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and reinstated the RTC's preliminary injunction.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners:** Obligated to make installment payments under the Contract to Sell.
*   **Respondents:**  Initially obligated under the Contract to Sell. They have a pending ejectment suit against Maunlad Homes, Inc. in the MTC of Makati.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Preliminary Injunction Bond:** Petitioners posted a bond to answer for damages Respondents might incur if the injunction was wrongly issued.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Contract to Sell Interpretation:** The core dispute hinges on the interpretation of the Contract to Sell and whether it granted Petitioners the right to continue collecting rent *pendente lite*. The Supreme Court found no prohibition on rental collection and noted that Respondent allowed the petitioners to collect rent after the execution of the contract to sell. The SC stated that the CA made a premature decision.
*   **Balance of Convenience:** The Supreme Court focused on maintaining the status quo, noting that the RTC should resolve the issue with dispatch. The rights and obligations of parties should be threshed out at trial.
*   **Ejectment Suit:** The existence of the pending ejectment suit filed by Union Bank against Maunlad Homes, Inc. suggests ongoing dispute over ultimate possession rights, potentially impacting long-term rental collection rights.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Preliminary Injunction Principles:** Cited *Bustamante v. Court of Appeals* (381 SCRA 171), emphasizing preservation of *status quo ante litem motam*.
*   **Contract to Sell vs. Contract of Sale:** CA cited a SC ruling that a contract to sell does not by itself give one the right to possess property.
*   **Lessor Ownership Not Required:** The Supreme Court highlighted that the lessor does not have to be the owner of the property, citing the principle of sub-lease and possessory rights as sufficient for leasing.
*   **Discretion of the Court:** Citing *Jao & Company, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* and *Avila v. Tapucar* on the discretionary power of the court to grant or deny a writ of preliminary injunction.

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The right of Petitioners to collect rent pending full payment under the Contract to Sell.
*   The propriety of the Respondents interfering with the Petitioners' management of the commercial complex prior to a final determination of the ejectment suit or ownership rights.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court prioritized maintaining the status quo while the main issue of the permanent injunction (and the rights and obligations under the Contract to Sell) is litigated at the RTC level. The finding that the CA made a premature decision that Petitioners have no right to collect rental payments from the tenants of the commercial complex, because that issue is yet to be fully resolved by the RTC in the main application for injunction is important. The risk is whether the Contract to Sell, upon full examination, definitively precludes Petitioners from collecting rent, rendering the preliminary injunction ultimately unsustainable. The Respondents' pending ejectment suit adds a further layer of complexity. The Court should wait for the determination of the ejectment suit.
