## Legal Document Summary: People v. Obello, G.R. No. 108772 (1998)

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Rolly Obello y Proquito of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) and sentencing him to *Reclusion Perpetua*.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** The RTC found Obello guilty of murder based on the testimony of witness Ricardo dela Cruz who witnessed Obello hold the victim, Danilo de Claro, while Antonio Go stabbed him.
*   **Conspiracy & Indispensable Cooperation:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the conviction, finding that even without prior agreement, Obello was a principal by indispensable cooperation. The SC cited *People vs. Montealegre* (161 SCRA 700) to support the finding.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The SC upheld the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, giving weight to dela Cruz's positive testimony over Obello's denial. Minor inconsistencies in the prosecution's testimony were deemed inconsequential and indicative of truthfulness. *People vs. Asoy* (251 SCRA 682)
*   **Treachery:** While not explicitly stated, the SC affirmed the lower court's implicit finding of treachery because the victim was unarmed and unable to defend himself due to Obello restraining him while the stabbing occurred.
*   **Damages:** The SC upheld the award of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, but deleted the reimbursement for funeral expenses of P6,000.00 due to lack of supporting evidence like receipts.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Obello is obligated to serve the sentence of *Reclusion Perpetua* with the accessory penalties provided by law.
*   Obello is liable to pay P50,000.00 as civil indemnity to the heirs of Danilo de Claro.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Direct Evidence of Conspiracy:** The finding of conspiracy relied heavily on circumstantial evidence, which may be vulnerable to attack if new evidence surfaces that can disprove his presence in the crime scene. This relies on the idea that circumstantial evidence must amount to an actual direct evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Credibility of Witness Dela Cruz:** Obello challenged dela Cruz's credibility but failed. If further investigation uncovers information significantly undermining dela Cruz's credibility, the conviction might be challenged (though unlikely at this stage).

*   Further investigation into Ricardo dela Cruz's background is warranted.

*   While the conviction seems solid based on the SC's decision, exploring any potential alibi evidence, however late, may be advisable.
