## Legal Document Summary: People v. Taruc, G.R. No. 185202

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision which affirmed with modification the Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Francisco Taruc for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Accusation:** Francisco Taruc (Accused-Appellant) was charged with murder for the death of Emelito Sualog, alleging intent to kill, treachery, and evident premeditation by shooting the victim with a .45 caliber firearm.
*   **Trial Court Decision:** RTC found Taruc guilty of murder beyond reasonable doubt with the aggravating circumstance of treachery and sentenced him to death. He was also ordered to pay damages.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** The CA affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty to *reclusion perpetua* due to Republic Act No. 9346 (prohibiting the death penalty). The CA also modified the amounts of damages.
*   **Escape from Jail:** Taruc escaped from Bataan Provincial Jail during trial and before the promulgation of judgment, which the RTC considered a waiver to cross-examine a prosecution witness. He remained at large throughout the CA proceedings and the current petition before the Supreme Court (SC).
*   **PAO Representation:** Taruc was represented by the Public Attorney's Office (PAO) throughout the proceedings, even after his escape. The CA initially directed the PAO to show cause for failing to file briefs, but ultimately accepted their filings.

**Key Legal Issues & Analysis:**

*   **Loss of Right to Appeal Due to Escape:** The central issue is whether Taruc's escape from jail constitutes a waiver of his right to appeal.
*   **Rule 120, Section 6, paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** States that if the accused fails to appear at the promulgation of judgment without justifiable cause, he loses his remedies against the judgment, and the court shall order his arrest.
*   **Rule 124, Section 8, paragraph 2 of the same Rules:** Allows the Court of Appeals to dismiss the appeal if the appellant escapes from prison or confinement.
*   **Applicability of People v. Mapalao (274 Phil. 354, 363 (1991)):** Cites that an escaped accused loses standing in court and waives the right to seek relief unless he surrenders.
*   **People v. Ang Gioc (73 Phil 366, 369):** Affirms that while some fundamental rights are unwaivable, the right to appeal is not one of them and can be waived expressly or by implication, such as by fleeing.
*   **Automatic Review:** A.M. No. 00-5-03-SC makes review of death penalty cases mandatory, which allows the Court of Appeals to review the case despite the accused being at large.
*   **SC's Stance:** The SC invoked Rule 125, Section 1, extending the CA's power to dismiss appeals of escapees to the SC.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Conviction for Murder:** Taruc faces a sentence of *reclusion perpetua*, as affirmed by the CA.
*   **Civil Liabilities:** He is liable for civil indemnity, actual damages, moral damages, and exemplary damages to the heirs of the victim.
*   **Risk of Arrest and Incarceration:** Upon capture, Taruc will immediately be incarcerated to serve his sentence.
*   **Dismissal of Appeal:** Because of the escape, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   The reliance on PAO representation *after* Taruc's escape raises questions about the efficacy of representation and whether a de facto waiver occurred.
*   Whether the mandatory review by the CA effectively negates the waiver of appeal due to escape is a potential point of contention, although the Court ultimately dismisses the appeal.
