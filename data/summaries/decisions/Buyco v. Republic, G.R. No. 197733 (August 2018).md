## Legal Document Summary: Buyco v. Republic of the Philippines (G.R. No. 197733)

**Document Type:** Resolution on Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA Decision in a land registration case.

**Core Issue:** Propriety of granting a second land registration application after a prior application for the same land was denied with finality by the Supreme Court in *Director of Lands v. Buyco* (290 Phil. 504 [1992]).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Subject Land:** Lot 1, Psu-127238 (3,194,788 sq. m.) in Romblon.
*   **Applicants' Claim:** Claim ownership and seek registration under Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act, now superseded by PD 1529) based on alleged ownership by predecessor-in-interest, Charles Hankins.
*   **Republic's Opposition:** Claims *res judicata* due to the prior SC decision and ineligibility of applicants to acquire lands in the Philippines during their American citizenship.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Res Judicata:** The CA initially reversed the RTC, finding that *res judicata* barred the second application because the previous SC decision had attained finality.
*   **Failure to Prove Alienability & Disposability:** The SC ultimately denied the application (affirming the CA's reversal of the RTC) for failure to sufficiently prove the subject land is alienable and disposable land of the public domain. This was a key issue in the previous SC case.
*   **Evidentiary Standard:** The SC reiterated *Republic v. T.A.N. Properties, Inc.* and *Dumo v. Republic of the Philippines*, requiring *two* documents to prove alienability and disposability: (1) a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary, and (2) a certificate of land classification status issued by the CENRO/PENRO based on the DENR Secretary's approved land classification.
*   **Insufficient Evidence:** The presented Certification from the CENRO of Odiongan, Romblon, and the Land Investigator's report were deemed insufficient, echoing concerns raised in the previous SC case.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Director of Lands v. Buyco (290 Phil. 504 [1992]):** The first SC case denying the land registration application due to failure to prove that the land was alienable and disposable.
*   **Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act):** Basis for the initial application, now superseded by PD 1529.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** The current governing law on land registration.
*   **Republic v. T.A.N. Properties, Inc. (578 Phil. 441 [2008]):** Sets forth the evidentiary requirements to prove that the land subject of the application for registration is alienable and disposable.
*   **Dumo v. Republic of the Philippines (G.R. No. 218269, June 6, 2018):** Reaffirms the requirements laid down in *Republic v. T.A.N.*
*   **Republic v. Nicolas (G.R. No. 181435, October 2, 2017):**
*   **Republic v. Lualhati (757 Phil. 119, 132 [2015]):** Case cited in Nicolas rejecting the attempt of the applicant to prove the alienable and disposable character of the subject land through PENRO or CENRO certifications.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The dismissal of the application was made "without prejudice," which petitioners argued allowed for a subsequent re-filing. The SC rejected this argument based on the finality of the prior SC decision and the failure to overcome the alienability issue.
*   Petitioners argued that they "cured" the obstacles to registration mentioned in the first SC decision by providing the CENRO Certification. This argument was dismissed by the SC, highlighting the higher evidentiary standard established in *Republic v. T.A.N. Properties, Inc.* and *Dumo v. Republic of the Philippines*.

**Conclusion:**

The SC denied the petition because the petitioners failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that the land was alienable and disposable. The court emphasized the strict evidentiary requirements for land registration and upheld the principle of *res judicata*. The key takeaway is that a CENRO certification alone is not sufficient to establish the alienable and disposable nature of land for registration purposes; presentation of a copy of the original land classification approved by the DENR Secretary is required. While the dismissal was without prejudice, a future application would necessitate meeting the strict evidentiary burden regarding alienability and disposability.
