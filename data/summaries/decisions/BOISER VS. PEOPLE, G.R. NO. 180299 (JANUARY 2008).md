## Legal Document Summary: *Lyndon D. Boiser v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 180299

**Nature of Document:** Resolution of the Supreme Court denying a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) denial of the petitioner's omnibus motion to quash Informations for acts of lasciviousness, child abuse, and rape.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Prosecution's Obligation:** To present probable cause to indict the petitioner.
*   **Petitioner's Allegation:** Absence of probable cause and lack of jurisdiction over his person.
*   **Court's Finding:** Probable cause exists based on the investigating prosecutor and trial judge's findings. Determination of probable cause is generally deferred to the prosecutor (citing *Serapio v. Sandiganbayan*).
*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** To proceed to trial and present his defenses.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioner's Liability:** Potential conviction on charges of acts of lasciviousness, child abuse, and rape.
*   **Risk to Petitioner:** Unfavorable outcome at trial.
*   **Risk of Delay:** The Court views the numerous motions filed by the petitioner as a delaying tactic.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Petition for Review on Certiorari.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Petition for Certiorari (deemed improper remedy).
*   **Republic Act No. 9262:** Reference to the omission of the minor's name pursuant to this Act and *People v. Cabalquinto*.
*   **Acharon v. Purisima:** Cited for the principle that a petition for certiorari is not the proper remedy against an order denying a motion to quash.
*   **Serapio v. Sandiganbayan:** Cited for the deference given to the prosecutor's determination of probable cause.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "probable cause" appears to be contentious. The Court notes that it needs only to rest on evidence showing that more likely than not a crime has been committed and was committed by the suspect, not on clear and convincing evidence of guilt.

**Potential Arguments for Each Side:**

*   **Petitioner:** Could argue insufficient evidence for probable cause, procedural irregularities in the preliminary investigation, or that the court improperly denied the motions to quash.
*   **Prosecution:** Will argue that probable cause exists, the RTC properly denied the motion to quash (as it is an interlocutory order), and the petitioner's actions are dilatory.

**Conclusion:**

The document indicates that the Supreme Court found no reversible error in the CA's decision affirming the RTC's denial of the petitioner's motion to quash. The Court emphasized that the proper recourse for the petitioner is to proceed to trial and present his defenses. The case suggests a strong likelihood that the petitioner will face trial on the charges.
