**Case Summary: *Villanueva v. Reodique*** (G.R. Nos. 221647 & 222003)

**Facts:** This case involves consolidated petitions challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision modifying the Office of the Ombudsman's (OMB) ruling finding F/SInsp. Rolando T. Reodique guilty of Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service. The OMB initially dismissed Reodique, but the CA modified the penalty to a one-year suspension. The charges stemmed from Reodique allegedly shouting defamatory statements and making obscene gestures at Loida S. Villanueva, attributed to a falling out between Villanueva's husband and Reodique in a Guardians Brotherhood.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Reodique was found administratively liable for violating Section 46(27), Chapter 7, Subtitle A, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 (EO 292) and Section 22(t), Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of EO 292, specifically for "Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service." This stems from his offensive conduct towards Villanueva.
*   **Penalty for Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of Service (2nd Offense):** Section 22(t) clearly mandates dismissal for a second offense. The OMB initially imposed the correct penalty, but the CA erred in reducing it to a one-year suspension.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Reodique is liable for conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service.
*   **Dismissal:** As this is his second offense for the same infraction, the Supreme Court ultimately ordered Reodique's dismissal from the service, with forfeiture of retirement benefits and perpetual disqualification from holding public office. If dismissal is impossible due to retirement or resignation, a fine equivalent to one year's salary applies.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Discretion in Penalty Imposition:** The CA attempted to exercise discretion in mitigating the penalty based on Reodique's length of service and commendations. However, the Supreme Court rejected this, emphasizing the mandatory nature of the prescribed penalty under Section 22(t). This highlights the risk of lower courts improperly applying mitigating factors where a statute prescribes a specific penalty.
*   **Definition of "Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service":** The decision reiterates that the conduct need not be related to official functions but must tarnish the public officer's image. This broad definition creates a risk of subjective interpretations, though jurisprudence provides examples.
*   **Alternative Penalty:** The caveat regarding retirement or resignation triggering a fine equal to one year's salary requires careful calculation and enforcement if Reodique is no longer in active service.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987):** Section 46(27) provides the general basis for disciplinary action.
*   **Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of EO 292, Rule XIV, Section 22(t):** This section provides the specific penalties for conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service (suspension for the first offense, dismissal for the second).
*   **Republic Act No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees):**  This law outlines the expected standards of personal conduct and is cited to emphasize the importance of justness, sincerity, and respect for others.
*   **Morfe v. Mutuc, 130 Phil. 415 (1968):** Cited for the principle that courts must apply laws regardless of their perceived wisdom as long as they are constitutional.
*   **Government Service Insurance System v. Mayordomo, 665 Phil. 131, 150 (2011):** Jurisprudence confirming act need not be related to official functions.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Supreme Court emphasized the clear and unambiguous language of Section 22(t) and that any form of second violation warrants dismissal.
