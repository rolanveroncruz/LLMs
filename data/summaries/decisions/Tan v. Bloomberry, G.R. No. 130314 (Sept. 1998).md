## Legal Document Summary - *Annie Tan vs. Court of Appeals and Bloomberry Export Manufacturing, Inc.*

**Case Citation:** 356 Phil. 1058 (G.R. No. 130314, September 22, 1998)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition to set aside the Court of Appeals' Decision which reversed the RTC's order granting a hearing on Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration. This revolves around a consolidated case concerning a lease agreement dispute between Annie Tan (Lessor) and Bloomberry Export Manufacturing (Lessee) involving ejectment and consignation.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Lease Agreement:**  A five-year lease agreement was established between the parties, beginning on February 17, 1995, and ending on February 17, 2000, with a monthly rental of P20,000 for the first three years.
*   **Consolidated Cases:** An ejectment case filed by the lessor due to alleged contract violations was consolidated with a consignation case filed by the lessee after rental payments were refused.
*   **MTC Decision:** The MTC ruled in favor of the Lessee, dismissing the Lessor's complaint for breach of contract and failure to pay rentals.
*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC affirmed the MTC's Decision.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration (MR):** The Lessor filed a Motion for Reconsideration with the RTC that *did not contain a Notice of Hearing* as required by Section 5, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Ex-Parte Motion for Entry of Judgment:** The Lessee filed this motion, arguing the MR was a "mere scrap of paper" and did not toll the appeal period, citing *Traders Royal Bank vs. Court of Appeals, 208 SCRA 199.*
*   **RTC Order:** Despite the lack of notice, the RTC granted the Lessor's motion to set the MR for hearing.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals reversed the RTC, holding that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion. It cited precedent establishing that a motion without a proper notice of hearing is a nullity and does not stop the running of the appeal period.

**Obligations:**

*   The lessee is obligated to pay the monthly rental in accordance to their initial contract with the lessor.

**Liabilities:**

*   The case highlights the liability of a movant’s counsel when not following procedure in a timely manner.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Judgment:** Due to the defective Motion for Reconsideration, the RTC's initial decision affirming the MTC ruling could be considered final and executory.
*   **Loss of Appeal:** The Lessor loses the opportunity to appeal the unfavorable decisions of the MTC and RTC due to the procedural error.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 15, Sections 4 and 5 of the Rules of Court:** These sections outline the requirements for written motions, including the need for a notice of hearing specifying the time and date of the hearing, which must be served at least three days before the hearing.

**Case Law:**

*   The decision heavily relies on established jurisprudence regarding the mandatory nature of notice of hearing requirements for motions, including:
    *   *De la Peña v. De la Peña, 258 SCRA 298, July 5, 1996.*
    *   *Pojas v. Gozo-Dadole, 192 SCRA 575, December 21, 1990.*
    *   *New Japan Motors, Inc. v. Perucho, 74 SCRA 14, November 5, 1976.*
    *   *Sembrano v. Ramirez, 166 SCRA 30, September 28, 1988.*
    *   *In re Almacen, 31 SCRA 562, February 18, 1970.*
    *   *Manila Surety and Fidelity Co., Inc. v. Bath Construction and Company, 14 SCRA 435, June 24, 1965.*

*   The court distinguishes this case from *Galvez v. Court of Appeals, 237 SCRA 685, October 24, 1994,* *Tamargo v. Court of Appeals, 209 SCRA 518, June 3, 1992,* and *Que v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 169 SCRA 137, January 13, 1989,* arguing that those cases involved different factual scenarios or unique considerations that justified deviations from the strict procedural rules.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "inadvertent" omission of the Notice of Hearing is heavily scrutinized. The court finds the Lessor's explanation unconvincing, suggesting deliberate non-compliance rather than an honest mistake.
*   The applicability of liberal construction of procedural rules is a point of contention. The court finds that the Lessor failed to demonstrate circumstances warranting such a deviation.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court *denies* the petition and *affirms* the CA decision. The Court holds that the failure to include a Notice of Hearing in the Motion for Reconsideration was a fatal defect, rendering the motion a mere scrap of paper that did not toll the running of the appeal period. This reinforces the mandatory nature of procedural rules and underscores the importance of meticulous compliance by legal counsel. The petitioner is not excused from her own error.
