## Legal Document Summary: People v. Ravanes, G.R. No. 128379 (1998)

**Case Overview:** This is a criminal case certified to the Supreme Court for review after the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction of Brando Ravanes for two counts of murder and one count of frustrated murder. The RTC originally convicted Ravanes, sentencing him to indeterminate penalties for each crime. The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions but modified the penalty for murder to *reclusion perpetua*.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Factual Background:** Ravanes, along with accomplices, robbed, assaulted, and threw Emilito Trinidad, Nelson Trinidad, and Reynante Estipona into a manhole, resulting in the deaths of the Trinidad brothers and injuries to Estipona.

*   **Charges:**
    *   Two counts of Murder (Emilito and Nelson Trinidad)
    *   Frustrated Murder (Reynante Estipona)

*   **Accused's Defense:** Alibi - Ravanes claimed to be at home in Tungkong Mangga, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, attending to his wife. He also claimed police coerced Reynante into implicating him.

*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision.

    *   **Rejection of Alibi:** The Court found the alibi weak and insufficient. The accused failed to prove the impossibility of being at the crime scene. The positive identification by Reynante Estipona outweighs the alibi. Case law cited: *People v. Ballabare, G.R. No. 108871, 19 November 1996, 264 SCRA 366*.

    *   **Credibility of Prosecution Witness:** Reynante Estipona's testimony was deemed credible, the court rejected claims by the defense that it would've been impossible to identify their aggressors. The defense had no proof that victims were blindfolded.

    *   **Circumstances of the Crime:** The Court found that abuse of superior strength and treachery attended the commission of the crime, qualifying the killing to murder.

    *   **Penalties:**
        *   **Murder (2 counts):** *Reclusion Perpetua* for each count. This reflects the application of Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, applicable at the time of the offense. RA 7659 took effect December 31, 1993, which classifies murder under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code as a heinous crime and punished as such.
        *   **Frustrated Murder:** Indeterminate sentence of 4 years, 2 months, and 10 days of *prision correccional* maximum as minimum, to 12 years, 6 months, and 20 days of *reclusion temporal* minimum as maximum.  The application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law is highlighted, referring to Art. 50 of the Revised Penal Code.

    *   **Civil Liabilities:** The accused was ordered to indemnify the heirs of Emilito Trinidad P50,000.00 and the heirs of Nelson Trinidad P50,000.00, and to pay both sets of heirs jointly P24,380.00 for funeral expenses.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law Application:** The specific ranges applied under the Indeterminate Sentence Law for the frustrated murder conviction are accurate and consistent with prevailing jurisprudence.

*   **Lack of Evidence of Coercion:** Ravanes' claim of police coercion was dismissed due to the lack of supporting evidence such as a medical certificate. This highlights the importance of documenting any claims of abuse or coercion.

**Key Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 248 (Murder)
*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 50 (Penalty for Frustrated Crimes)
*   Rules of Court, Sec. 13, par. (2), Rule 124 (Certification to Supreme Court in Capital Offenses)
