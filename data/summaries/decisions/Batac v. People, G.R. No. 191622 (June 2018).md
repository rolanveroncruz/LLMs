**Case Summary: _Batac v. People_, G.R. No. 191622 (June 6, 2018)**

This case involves a conviction for Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) (as amended by RA 4885), specifically issuing post-dated checks without sufficient funds. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision finding Iluminada Batac guilty, but modified the penalty in light of RA 10951.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Batac issued 14 post-dated checks to Roger Frias, which were dishonored due to "Account Closed". Frias was convinced to rediscount the checks based on Batac's representation that they were funded.
*   **Defense:** Batac denied issuing the checks, claiming it was Erlinda Cabardo and that she never transacted with Frias. Also claims if there's criminal liability, it should be for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (B.P. Blg. 22), or the Bouncing Checks Law, instead of estafa.
*   **Lower Court Findings:** Both the RTC and CA found Batac guilty of Estafa, based on Frias' testimony (corroborated by his sister), which they found more credible than Batac's denial.
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed the lower courts' factual findings. The SC held that Batac induced Frias to part with his money by falsely representing that the checks were adequately funded. Her express admission that the account had insufficient funds at the time of issuance established the element of deceit.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Batac is criminally liable for Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the RPC.
*   **Restitution:** Batac is obligated to reimburse Frias the amount of P103,500.00, subject to legal interest.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Issue:** Batac's defense hinges on a factual issue (identity of the issuer of the checks), which is difficult to overturn on appeal to the SC. As the trial court and appellate court already have given credence to the complaining witness's testimony.
*   **B.P. Blg. 22 vs. Estafa:** Batac's argument that she should only be liable under B.P. Blg. 22 is without merit. The SC emphasized the distinction between the two offenses: estafa requires deceit and damage, which are absent in B.P. Blg. 22 violations. Citing _Rimando v. Aldaba_, 745 Phil. 358, 364 (2014).
*   **Penalty Modification (RA 10951):** The SC modified the penalty in accordance with RA 10951. This amendment reduced the potential sentence for Estafa involving amounts less than P1,200,000.00, resulting in a more lenient indeterminate sentence.
*   **Interest Rate:** The SC aligned the interest rate on the monetary award to 6% per annum from finality, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence, citing _People v. Jugueta_, 783 Phil. 806, 854 (2016) citing _Nacar v. Gallery Frames_, 716 Phil. 267, 283 (2013).

**Conclusion:**

The SC upheld Batac's conviction for Estafa. The key takeaways are the establishment of deceit through Batac's representations and the application of RA 10951, which resulted in a reduced penalty. There is a risk that the judgment against Batac is upheld, and that Frias is awarded.
