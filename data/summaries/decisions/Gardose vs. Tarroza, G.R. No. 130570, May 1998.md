**Case Summary: *Spouses Gil and Noelli Gardose vs. Reynaldo S. Tarroza***

**Citation:** 352 Phil. 797 (G.R. No. 130570, May 19, 1998)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's judgment in favor of the respondent for a sum of money.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Monetary Award:** Petitioners ordered to pay respondent P70,000, P50,000, and P200,000 with 12% interest per annum from the filing of the complaint, plus P50,000 in attorney's fees, and costs of suit.
*   **Liability as Accommodation Party:** Petitioner Noelli Gardose held primarily and unconditionally liable on dishonored checks as an accommodation party. Cites *Town Savings & Loan Bank, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 223 SCRA 459*.
*   **Interest:** 12% interest awarded based on Article 2209 of the Civil Code, given the absence of a stipulated interest rate and the debtor's delay. Cites *National Power Corporation vs. Agnar, G.R. No. 60225-26, May 8, 1992*.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Award justified by petitioners' gross evident bad faith in refusing to pay the just and demandable claim. Cites *Reyes v. Zubirri, 208 SCRA 561; Maersk Line vs. Court of Appeals, 222 SCRA 108*.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Primary liability for the sum of money owed to the respondent. Noelli Gardose faces liability as the accommodation party for the dishonored checks.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Judgment:** Petitioners face the risk of asset seizure and other enforcement actions to satisfy the judgment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Res Judicata (Rule 39, Section 49):** Discussed but found inapplicable because the initial dismissal of the first case (Civil Case No. Q-89-3500) was due to failure to effect service by publication, meaning the court lacked jurisdiction. Cites *Republic Planters Bank vs. Molina, 166 SCRA 39*.
*   **Accommodation Party (Negotiable Instruments Law):** Noelli Gardose held liable as an accommodation party.  This is relevant to Sections of NIL pertaining to the obligations of accommodation parties and drawers of instruments.
*   **Interest (Article 2209 of the Civil Code):** Basis for the 12% interest rate awarded.
*   **Forum Shopping (Revised Circular No. 28-91 and Administrative Circular No. 04-94):** The court states that it does not apply to the case at hand as the case was filed before effectivity of the rules.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of "gross evident bad faith" justifying attorney's fees could be a point of contention if the petitioners argued the refusal was based on legitimate legal grounds rather than bad faith.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court upheld the lower courts decisions.
