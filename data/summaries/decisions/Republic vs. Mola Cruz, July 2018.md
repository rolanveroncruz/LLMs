## Legal Document Summary: *Republic of the Philippines v. Liberato P. Mola Cruz* (G.R. No. 236629)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC's declaration of nullity of marriage between Respondent Liberato P. Mola Cruz and Liezl S. Conag based on Article 36 of the Family Code (psychological incapacity).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:**  The core legal basis for the nullity, defining psychological incapacity as existing at the time of marriage, even if manifestations are post-celebration. It is not just inability to comply but inability to understand obligations (citing *Antonio v. Reyes*, 519 Phil. 337 (2006)).
*   **Marriage Void Ab Initio:** The RTC ruling, affirmed by the CA and now the Supreme Court, declares the marriage null and void from the beginning.

**Obligations:**

*   The parties' *essential marital obligations* under Articles 68-71 (mutual support, fidelity, respect, etc.) and Articles 220, 221, and 225 (parental obligations, if applicable) of the Family Code.  The decision focuses on Liezl's failure to fulfill these obligations.
*   Respondent had the *burden of proof* to demonstrate Liezl's psychological incapacity at the time of the marriage.

**Liabilities:**

*   No explicit monetary liabilities are discussed. The primary consequence is the dissolution of the marriage.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Collusion:**  Addressed by the Public Prosecutor's report, which states that the filing of the petition was not a result of collusion between the spouses.
*   **Proof of Antecedence & Gravity:**  The main challenge raised by the Republic is that the evidence (specifically Dr. Tudla's expert testimony) failed to sufficiently prove that Liezl's histrionic personality disorder existed *before* the marriage and was of sufficient *gravity* to render her incapable of fulfilling marital obligations.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code, Article 36:**  The foundation of the case.
*   ***Santos v. Court of Appeals*, 310 Phil. 21 (1995):** Initial interpretation of "psychological incapacity."
*   ***Republic v. Court of Appeals and Molina*, 335 Phil. 664 (1997):**  Previously the guiding framework for psychological incapacity cases. *Molina* is discussed, but the court emphasizes a more flexible approach, citing *Ngo Te v. Yu-Te*, 598 Phil. 666 (2009), which warned against a rigid application of *Molina*.
*   ***Republic v. Pangasinan*, 792 Phil. 808 (2016):**  Recent iteration of *Molina* guidelines.
*   ***Kalaw v. Fernandez*, 750 Phil. 482 (2015):** Highlights respect due to trial court findings on psychological incapacity and addresses admissibility of expert opinions without personal examination of the respondent.
*   **Expert testimony** is key, especially from psychologists and psychiatrists, although the *absence* of a physical exam isn't dispositive, citing *Marcos v. Marcos*, 397 Phil. 840 (2000).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Psychological Incapacity" Definition:**  The ongoing struggle to define and apply "psychological incapacity" under Article 36 remains contentious. The *Ngo Te* decision reflects a shift away from the rigid application of *Molina*.
*   **Reliance on Expert Testimony:** The weight given to Dr. Tudla's report, despite the Republic's challenge that it was based on "hearsay," is a key point.  The Court distinguished based on the totality of evidence and *Kalaw v. Fernandez*.

**Summary of Reasoning:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts, finding that the totality of evidence sufficiently demonstrated Liezl's histrionic personality disorder, which existed *before* the marriage and manifested itself in a grave inability to fulfill her essential marital obligations. Liezl's actions (affair, introducing husband as "brother," disrespect, abandonment) were linked to her underlying personality disorder and showed a lack of understanding of marital responsibilities. While infidelity and abandonment are typically grounds for legal separation, the court here determined those actions were manifestations of the underlying psychological incapacity. The Court emphasized a case-by-case approach and deference to the trial court's factual findings. The concurring opinion by Justice Leonen advocates for divorce as a more suitable solution, arguing that forcing parties to remain in unfulfilling marriages is cruel and inconsistent with fundamental rights.
