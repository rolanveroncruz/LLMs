## Legal Document Summary: People v. Fuertes, G.R. No. 126285 (1998)

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Rodel Fuertes y Ocampo

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, En Banc

**Facts:** Accused-appellant Rodel Fuertes was convicted by the RTC of Olongapo City for rape of a minor (under 12 years old) under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659. The victim, Jacklyn Lee Anas, was sleeping at home when the accused entered her house and raped her. Medical evidence confirmed lacerations on the victim's hymen. The accused raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was at home at the time of the incident.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction with modification, finding Fuertes guilty beyond reasonable doubt of simple rape and sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Crime:** Rape of a minor (below 12 years old) under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659.
*   **Penalty:** Originally sentenced to 30 years and 1 day to 40 years of *reclusion perpetua* by the RTC. The Supreme Court modified it to the indivisible penalty of *reclusion perpetua*, clarifying the law still considers the nature of *reclusion perpetua* as an indivisible penalty.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution presented the victim's testimony, her mother's testimony, and the medico-legal certificate. The victim positively identified the accused as her attacker. The prosecution established the identity and guilt of the accused.
*   **Defense:** The defense presented alibi, which was rejected by the court due to its failure to prove that it was physically impossible for the accused to be at the crime scene. The Supreme Court highlighted that accused lived within 15-20 minutes from victim.
*   **Identification:** The victim had ample opportunity to identify the accused during the rape.
*   **Damages:** The RTC awarded P50,000 as moral damages, which the Supreme Court clarified should be considered actual/compensatory damages; court also awarded an additional P50,000 as moral damages (citing People vs. Prades).

**Obligations:**

*   Accused to serve *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused to pay P50,000 as actual/compensatory damages and P50,000 as moral damages to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for rape.
*   Civil liability for damages arising from the crime.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in the Information:** The Supreme Court noted the grammatical and legal imprecision in the Information which stated "a minor below 12 years old" as the victim, noting the possible inclusion of a minor below 7 years old, in which case the crime would be punishable by death; however, the Supreme Court stated that it did not constitute reversible error since it can be corrected by a bill of particulars.
*   **Alibi:** Standard risk associated with alibi defense, particularly when the accused's location is easily accessible to the crime scene and corroborating witnesses are absent.
*   **Impact of RA 7659 on Indivisible Penalties:** The Supreme Court clarifies that RA 7659's statement of the duration of *reclusion perpetua* (20 years and 1 day to 40 years) did not alter its fundamental nature as an indivisible penalty.
*   **Award of Moral Damages:** While the award is standard in rape cases, lack of specific evidence of emotional distress is generally not a bar, per jurisprudence (People v. Prades).
