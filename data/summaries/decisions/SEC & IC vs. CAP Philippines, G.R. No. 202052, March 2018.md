**Case:** SEC & IC vs. College Assurance Plan Philippines, Inc. (CAP), G.R. No. 202052, March 7, 2018 (827 Phil. 339)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, reiterating that the assets of a pre-need company's trust fund are exclusively for the benefit of planholders and cannot be used to satisfy the claims of the company's creditors. The case concerns CAP's attempt to use proceeds from the sale of MRT III Bonds, which were part of its trust fund, to pay Smart Share Investment, Ltd. (Smart) and Fil-Estate Management, Inc. (FEMI), from whom CAP purchased the bonds.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Trust Fund Purpose:** R.A. No. 9829 (Pre-Need Code of the Philippines), Section 30, mandates that trust fund assets are *solely* for the benefit of planholders.
*   **Restrictions on Withdrawal:** Section 30 and Rule 16.4 of the New Rules on the Registration and Sale of Pre-Need Plans (under the Securities Regulation Code) restrict withdrawals from the trust fund to paying benefits to planholders, trust fees, bank charges, investment expenses, termination values, and certain taxes.
*   **Definition of "Benefits":** The Court clarifies that "benefits" refer specifically to payments or services owed to the planholders as stipulated in their pre-need plans (Section 1.6, Rule 1, New Rules).

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Creditor Claims:** The ruling establishes a firm barrier against creditors of the pre-need company accessing the trust fund. CAP cannot use the trust fund to pay its debts to Smart and FEMI, even if those debts arose from the initial funding of the trust.
*   **Insolvency Protection:** Section 30 of the Pre-Need Code protects the trust fund from general creditors in case of the company's insolvency.
*   **Stay Order:** The rehabilitation court's stay order suspending enforcement of claims against CAP does not extend to allowing CAP to deplete the trust fund to pay creditors, as that would violate the trust's purpose.
*   **Risk of protracted litigation if Smart and FEMI pursue their claims against CAP's other assets.**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Cost of services rendered or property delivered"**: CAP argued this allowed payment to Smart/FEMI. The Court rejected this, limiting the definition to costs associated with delivering benefits to *planholders*.
*   **"Administrative expenses"**: CAP argued that the payment was a necessary expense. The Court disagreed and clarified the definition of administrative expenses.
