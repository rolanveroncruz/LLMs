**Case:** *Asset Privatization Trust (APT) vs. T.J. Enterprises* (G.R. No. 167195, May 08, 2009)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision holding APT liable for actual damages for breach of contract. APT sold machinery to T.J. Enterprises on an "as-is-where-is" basis, but failed to deliver complete and undamaged goods due to Creative Lines' (lessee of the property where goods were stored) refusal to allow hauling and subsequent damage discovered upon retrieval.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Absolute Sale:**  APT and T.J. Enterprises entered into a contract for the sale of machinery and refrigeration equipment. Both warranted the authority to enter into the contract and perform their obligations (Delivery and payment of the goods).
*   **Delivery (Art. 1477, 1497, 1498 Civil Code):**  Ownership transfers upon actual or constructive delivery.  Constructive delivery requires placing the buyer in control.
*   **As-Is-Where-Is:** Interpreted solely as describing the physical condition and location of the goods, not excusing the seller's obligation to deliver them in the condition they were sold (National Development Company v. Madrigal Wan Hai Lines Corporation, 458 Phil. 1038, 1054 (2003)).
*   **Warranty Disclaimer:** Disclaimer of warranty does not absolve APT of its obligation to transfer ownership and possession of the goods.
*   **Fortuitous Event (Art. 1174 Civil Code):**  APT argued Creative Lines' refusal was a *force majeure*, but the court ruled that this event was foreseeable and APT should have made prior arrangements.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Breach of Contract (Art. 1170 Civil Code):** APT is liable for damages due to failure to deliver ownership and possession, contravening the contract's tenor.
*   **Actual Damages (Art. 2201 Civil Code):**  APT is liable for damages that are the natural and probable consequences of the breach, foreseeable at the time of the obligation.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Delivery:**  The core issue is whether constructive delivery occurred.  The court found it did not because APT did not have control over the goods at the time of sale, Creative Lines did.  This highlights the importance of ensuring control over property before sale.
*   **"As-Is-Where-Is" Interpretation:** APT's reliance on this clause as a complete shield from liability was unsuccessful. The court emphasized that it only relates to the physical condition, not the obligation to deliver.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles:** 1170, 1174, 1477, 1495, 1496, 1497, 1498, 2201
*   **Santos v. Santos, 418 Phil. 681, 690-691 (2001):**  On constructive delivery.
*   **Ten Forty Realty and Development Corp. v. Cruz, 457 Phil. 603:** On the presumption of constructive delivery and its exceptions.
*   **National Development Company v. Madrigal Wan Hai Lines Corporation, 458 Phil. 1038, 1054 (2003):** On the interpretation of "as-is-where-is."
*   **Lea Mer Industries, Inc. v. Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. G.R. No. 161745, 30 September 2005, 471 SCRA 698,708:** Elements of a Fortuitous Event

**Conclusion:**

The case underscores the seller's responsibility to ensure actual or constructive delivery, regardless of "as-is-where-is" clauses. The seller bears the risk of loss until delivery.
