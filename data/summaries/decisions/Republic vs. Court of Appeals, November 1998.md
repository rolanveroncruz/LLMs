Okay, here's a markdown summary of the provided legal document:

**Case:** *Republic of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals and Republic Real Estate Corporation* (consolidated with *Pasay City and Republic Real Estate Corporation vs. Court of Appeals and Republic of the Philippines*), G.R. Nos. 103882 & 105276, November 25, 1998.

**Legal Issue:** Validity of reclamation contract between Pasay City and Republic Real Estate Corporation (RREC) under Republic Act (RA) 1899, constitutionality of Presidential Decree (PD) 3-A, and the proper compensation owed to RREC.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **RA 1899:** Authorizes chartered cities and municipalities to reclaim "foreshore lands." The Republic argues that Pasay City reclaimed "submerged lands," not "foreshore lands," rendering the contract ultra vires. RREC contends "foreshore lands" under RA 1899 encompasses a broader meaning, inclusive of submerged lands.

*   **PD 3-A:** Nationalizes reclamation projects, limiting reclamation to the national government or its authorized agents, with compensation on *quantum meruit* basis for existing contracts. RREC argues this is an unconstitutional taking without due process and impairs contractual obligations.

*   **Reclamation Agreement & Pasay Ordinances:** Republic argues Pasay City's contract with RREC was made without proper authority and lacked required public bidding. RREC and Pasay City claim compliance with RA 1899, stating Pasay City was acting within legal parameters.

*   **Quantum Meruit:** Dispute over the area reclaimed by RREC (alleged 55 hectares) and the fair valuation of RREC's services before the national government took over (CDCP & PEA). Disagreement on whether the initial settlement amount offered by the Public Highways Ministry (MPH) in 1962 adjusted for present value is reasonable.

**Supreme Court Holding and Reasoning:**

*   **RA 1899 Interpretation:** "Foreshore lands" is to be strictly construed as "that part of the land adjacent to the sea which is alternately covered and left dry by the ordinary flow of the tides". SC relies on prior rulings in *Ponce v. Gomez* (L-21870) and *Ponce v. City of Cebu* (L-22669). RA 5187's inclusion of "submerged areas" impliedly recognizes RA 1899's limited scope. Submerged lands are outside the scope of the agreement.

*   **Validity of Agreement and Ordinances:** Pasay City's Ordinance Nos. 121 and 158 and the agreement are **NULL and VOID**. Reclamation project was invalid, having not completed public bidding. They do not conform with the Act. There is also no valid deed.

*   **PD 3-A Constitutionality:** Upheld the constitutionality of the Presidential Decree, as it is the government's right to exercise its powers and reclaim its domain.

*   **Cultural Center of the Philippines:** Court held that there was no legal and factual basis for the Court of Appeal's to overturn ownership of Cultural Center of the Philippines. The agreement did not validate the agreement to award the CCP's land back.

*   **Quantum Meruit Compensation:** RREC and Pasay City are entitled to *quantum meruit* compensation, fixed at **â‚±10,926,071.29**, plus 6% interest from May 1, 1962, until full payment, to be shared equally.

**Case Law References:**

*   *Ponce v. Gomez* (L-21870) and *Ponce v. City of Cebu* (L-22669): Defining "foreshore lands."
*   Numerous statutory construction cases relating to plain meaning, legislative intent, and strict interpretation of grants.

**Statutory References:**

*   RA 1899: Authorizing reclamation by local governments.
*   RA 5187: Appropriations Act referencing "foreshore and submerged areas."
*   PD 3-A: Nationalizing reclamation.
*   PD 1084: Creates Public Estate Authority.
*   PD Nos. 15 and 774: Conveys ownership of reclaimed land to CCP

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "foreshore lands" within the context of RA 1899.

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   Further litigation from third-party lot buyers who entered into Contracts to Sell with RREC, but for which the land was never transferred.
*   Potential challenges regarding the adequacy of the *quantum meruit* compensation award, especially considering the time elapsed since 1962.

**Notes:**

*   Justices Panganiban and Puno filed concurring opinions, providing more reasoning and evidence for their conclusions, respectively.
* Justice Romero filed separate opinion concurring with the decision, but dissenting from RREC's right to a settlement due to moral implications.
* Justice Kapunan did not take part in the decision.
