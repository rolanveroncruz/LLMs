## Legal Document Summary: *Arbilon v. Manlangit*, G.R. No. 197920

**Case:** *Demosthenes R. Arbilon v. Sofronio Manlangit*

**Court/Date:** Supreme Court, First Division, January 22, 2018

**Nature of Document:** Decision on Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision that reversed the RTC's dismissal of a complaint for recovery of possession (with replevin) of a compressor.

**Key Issue:** Determination of ownership and right to possession of an Atlas Copco Compressor.

**Facts:**

*   Manlangit (Respondent) purchased a compressor from Davao Diamond Industrial Supply (Davao Diamond) on credit via a sales invoice containing a "reservation of ownership" clause until full payment.
*   Arbilon (Petitioner) possessed the compressor.
*   Leanillo paid Davao Diamond for the compressor in installments.
*   Respondent filed a complaint for recovery of possession with replevin.

**Holdings:**

*   **Supreme Court held that Respondent is the lawful owner and possessor of the compressor, affirming the CA decision.**

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

1.  **Contract to Sell vs. Contract of Sale:** The Court affirmed the CA's finding that the transaction between Respondent and Davao Diamond was a *contract to sell*, based on the "reservation of ownership" clause in the Sales Invoice. This is a crucial distinction.  Ownership does not transfer until full payment. *See Sps. Tumibay. et. al. v. Sps. Lopez, 710 Phil. 19, 31 (2013)*
2.  **Payment by Third Party (Leanillo):** The Court held that Leanillo's payments constituted payment by a third party *on behalf of* Respondent.
3.  **Article 1236 of the Civil Code:**  Leanillo, as a third party who paid on behalf of Respondent, could demand reimbursement. However, Leanillo was not a party in this case, so the Court could not grant any relief in her favor; the Court specified that its ruling was *without prejudice* to any claim Leanillo may have against Respondent for reimbursement.
4.  **Respondent's Claim of Partnership Share:** Respondent argued that Leanillo paid with his partnership share, negating the need for reimbursement.  The Court rejected this argument because it was not raised during pre-trial and lacked evidence. *See LICOMCEN, Inc. v. Engr. Abainza, 704 Phil. 166 (2013).*
5. **Determination of Ownership:** The Court held that while the issue of ownership was raised, the determination was limited to who has the *better right* to possess the property, as it was not a final and binding determination on ownership and does not bar a future separate action between the same parties involving title to the property. *See Gabriel, Jr., et. al. v. Crisologo, 735 Phil. 673, 683 (2014).*

**Obligations:**

*   Respondent: Potentially obligated to reimburse Leanillo for the payments made on the compressor, subject to a future legal action by Leanillo.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability of Respondent to Leanillo for the amount paid towards the compressor.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Leanillo's Rights:** Leanillo's right to reimbursement is not resolved in this case but remains a significant legal risk.
*   **Absence of Leanillo:**  Her absence as a party prevents a complete resolution and leaves the issue of reimbursement outstanding.
*   **Limited Determination of Ownership:** The Court's clarification on the limits of their determination of ownership could lead to further litigation regarding title to the property.

**Relevant Statutes & Case Law:**

*   **Article 1236 of the Civil Code:** Pertains to payment by a third party.
*   *Sps. Tumibay. et. al. v. Sps. Lopez, 710 Phil. 19, 31 (2013)* Contract to Sell
*   *LICOMCEN, Inc. v. Engr. Abainza, 704 Phil. 166 (2013).* Pre-Trial Orders and Issues.
*   *Gabriel, Jr., et. al. v. Crisologo, 735 Phil. 673, 683 (2014).* Limited Determination of Ownership in a Replevin Action

**Recommendations:**

Advise respondent that Leanillo can still file a case and that he could be ordered by the court to reimburse the amount of the compressor.
