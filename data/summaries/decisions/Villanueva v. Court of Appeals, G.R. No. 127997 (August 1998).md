**Legal Document Summary: *Villanueva v. Court of Appeals & Manuel*, G.R. No. 127997 (2nd Division, August 7, 1998)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision in an action for sum of money.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Principal Obligation:** Dispute revolves around a dishonored check for P167,600.00 issued by Petitioner Villanueva to Respondent Manuel, ostensibly representing repayment of loans. Villanueva contends his actual debt is only P23,420.00. The lower courts found Villanueva liable for the full amount of P167,600.00.
*   **Interest:** The Court of Appeals imposed legal interest on the P167,600.00, plus 10% attorney's fees. This was disputed by the Petitioner. The Supreme Court modified the interest rate to 12% per annum from the filing of the complaint until finality, then 12% per annum on the total obligation until full satisfaction of the judgement.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The Court of Appeals directed petitioner to additionally pay private respondent attorneyâ€™s fees and litigation expenses in the amount of ten (10%) percent of P167,600.00.
*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 22 (B.P. 22):** A criminal complaint for violation of B.P. 22 (issuing a bouncing check) was filed concurrently with the civil action.

**Obligations:**

*   **Villanueva:** Obligated to pay Manuel P167,600.00 plus legal interest at 12% per annum from the filing of the complaint until finality, then 12% per annum on the total obligation (including accrued interest) until full satisfaction. Obligated to pay 10% attorney's fees of the P167,600.00.
*   **Manuel:** Entitled to receive P167,600.00, legal interest, and attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Villanueva:** Liable for breach of contract/failure to pay debt. Potential liability for violation of B.P. 22 if criminal case proceeds unfavorably.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute over Principal Obligation:** The central point of contention is the amount of the actual debt. Villanueva argues he only owes P23,420.00, but the courts have ruled against him. This raises the question if this amount was the real liability or a bigger liability was acquired.
*   **Usury Law:** Petitioner's argument regarding the repeal of the Usury Law is weak, given prevailing jurisprudence.
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:** SC uses this case to determine the legal interest.
*   **B.P. 22 Prosecution:** While not directly addressed in this decision, the outcome of the B.P. 22 case could have collateral consequences for Villanueva.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 22:** Law penalizing the issuance of bouncing checks.
*   **Civil Code (Articles 1169 & Title XVII):** Governing provisions on default and damages.
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 234 SCRA 78 (1994):** Establishes guidelines for awarding legal interest.
*   **Gaw v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 220 SCRA 405 (1993).** Court is limited to the review and revision of errors of law allegedly committed by the appellate court, as its findings of fact are deemed conclusive.
*   **Reyes v. Court of Appeals, 258 SCRA 651 (1996).** Outlines the exceptions when the court can overturn the rulings of the lower courts.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The specific details surrounding the origin of the debt (loans for "mining and fertilizer business") are not fully explained, potentially obscuring underlying business relationships or agreements.
