## Legal Document Summary: Megaforce Security and Allied Services, Inc. v. Henry Lactao (G.R. No. 160940)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which affirmed the NLRC's ruling of constructive illegal dismissal.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Megaforce Security and Allied Services, Inc. (employer) and Raul Manalo (General Manager).
*   **Respondents:** Henry Lactao (employee/security guard) and National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Employment:** Lactao was hired as a security guard by Megaforce and initially assigned to Merville Park Subdivision.
*   **Complaint:** Lactao filed a complaint for underpayment of wages, overtime pay, service incentive leave pay, and 13th-month pay.
*   **Reassignment & Recall:** Lactao was reassigned to ABB Industry, Inc., but subsequently recalled to headquarters.
*   **"Floating Status":** Lactao reported to headquarters but received no new assignment. He amended his complaint to include illegal dismissal.
*   **Employer's Defense:** Megaforce claimed Lactao was recalled due to poor performance and discipline, denied abandonment, and argued "floating status" is permissible for up to six months.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court DENIED the petition, affirming the CA's decision which upheld the NLRC's finding of constructive illegal dismissal.
*   The SC found that while the initial "off-detail" was within the acceptable timeframe, the continued failure to offer reassignment, even through the proceedings, constituted constructive dismissal.

**Key Legal Principles & Case Law:**

*   **Constructive Dismissal:** Defined as acts of discrimination, insensibility, or disdain by an employer that render continued employment unbearable. *Fungo v. Lourdes School of Mandaluyong, G.R. No. 152531, July 27, 2007, 528 SCRA 248, 256-257; The Philippine American Life and General Insurance Co. v. Gramaje, G.R. No. 156963, November 11, 2004, 442 SCRA 274, 290.*
*   **"Floating Status" of Security Guards:** Temporary "off-detail" is permissible and doesn't constitute dismissal *per se*. However, exceeding a reasonable time (generally six months) can lead to constructive dismissal. *Veterans Security Agency, Inc. v. Gonzalvo, Jr., G.R. No. 159293, December 16, 2005, 478 SCRA 298, 308.*
*   **Abandonment:** Filing a complaint for illegal dismissal is inconsistent with abandonment of employment. *GSP Manufacturing Corporation v. Cabanban, G.R. 150454, July 14, 2006, 495 SCRA 123, 126.*
*   **Reinstatement and Backwages (Article 279, Labor Code):** Unjustly dismissed employee is entitled to reinstatement, backwages (from time of dismissal until actual reinstatement), and other benefits.
*   **CA Procedures:** Failure to file a comment doesn't automatically guarantee success of the petition. The court still assesses the merits of the petition.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employer (Megaforce):** Liable for constructive illegal dismissal. Obligated to:
    *   Reinstate Lactao to his former or equivalent position.
    *   Pay backwages, allowances, and other benefits from the time of dismissal until actual reinstatement.
*   **Employee (Lactao):** Obligated to return to work upon proper reinstatement.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Computation of Backwages:** The case is remanded to the Labor Arbiter for computation of backwages, which could be a point of contention regarding the applicable rates and included benefits.
*   **Reasonable Interpretation of "Equivalent Position":** If Lactao's original position no longer exists, disagreement could arise on what constitutes an "equivalent position."
*   **Ambiguity in 'Other Benefits':** The phrase "other benefits" could lead to disputes regarding which benefits are included in the computation.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 279 of the Labor Code (unjust dismissal).

**Next Steps:**

*   Lactao should secure a writ of execution and implement the reinstatement order.
*   Megaforce should engage in good faith negotiations regarding the computation of backwages and benefits before the Labor Arbiter.
*   Monitor the Labor Arbiter's computation and be prepared to file an appeal if deemed erroneous.
