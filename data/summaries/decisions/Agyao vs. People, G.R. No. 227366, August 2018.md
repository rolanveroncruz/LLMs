Okay, here's a legally precise summary of the provided Supreme Court decision in *Domingo Agyao Macad @ Agpad v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 227366, August 01, 2018):

**Case Summary: *Domingo Agyao Macad @ Agpad v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 227366, August 01, 2018)**

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), specifically illegal drug transport.  The central issues are the legality of a warrantless arrest and search, and the chain of custody of the seized drugs (marijuana).

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Warrantless Arrest & Search:** The Court *affirmed* the CA's and RTC's ruling that the warrantless arrest and subsequent search of Macad were valid.  The Court held that PO1 Falolo had probable cause to believe Macad was committing a crime in *flagrante delicto* based on the distinct smell of marijuana emanating from Macad's baggage and the unusual shape/hardness of the bags. Macad's flight upon seeing SPO2 Suagen further solidified probable cause.
    *   The Court reasoned that PO1 Falolo's actions were reasonable under the circumstances, even though the search was not conducted immediately because the officer was off duty and the bus was crowded.
    *   The warrantless search was justified as incident to a lawful arrest. *Malacat v. Court of Appeals* (347 Phil. 462 (1997) *Posadas v. Court of Appeals* (266 Phil. 306 (1990).
    *   The court also ruled that the search was permissible as an extensive search of a moving vehicle based on probable cause, relying on precedent where the smell of marijuana was detected.

*   **Chain of Custody (Section 21, R.A. 9165):** The Court found that the prosecution *substantially complied* with the chain of custody requirements.  The marijuana bricks were marked, inventoried, and photographed at the Municipal Police Station in the presence of Macad, barangay chairman, DOJ representative, and media representative. The Court held that the marking at the police station was permissible, the minor discrepancy in the document, entitled "Turn Over of Evidence," which states that six (6) bricks of marijuana were contained in a carton, instead of the Sagada woven bag, was a minor oversight and does not in any way destroy the prosecution's case.  It also held that there was not a considerable time that elapsed from the moment that petitioner ran away from his baggage up to the time the police officers arrested him.

*   **Mode of Appeal** The CA affirmed the RTC decision imposing the penalty of life imprisonment to petitioner. Notably, however, the petition filed before this Court invokes grave abuse of discretion in assailing the CA decision, which is a ground under a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. In any event, even if the instant petition is treated as a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45, which is limited to questions of law, it still raises questions of fact because it essentially assails the appreciation of the testimonial and documentary evidence by the CA and the RTC. As a rule, these questions of fact cannot be entertained by the Court under Rule 45. Thus, the petition is procedurally infirm.

**Obligations:**

*   The police officers had a continuing obligation to maintain the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs.
*   The District Jail Warden of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, Bontoc District Jail, Bontoc, Mountain Province is directed to immediately transfer the accused, DOMINGO AGYAO MACAD, to the custody of the Bureau of Corrections, Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila after the expiration of fifteen (15) days from date of promulgation unless otherwise ordered by this Court.
*   Turn over the subject prohibited drugs are forfeited in favor of the government and are hereby directed to be turned over with dispatch to the Philippine Drug Enforcement (PDEA) for disposition in accordance with the law.

**Liabilities:** Macad is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of violation of Section 5 of R.A. [No.] 9165 and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of LIFE IMPRISONMENT and a fine of FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (PhP500,000.00).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Justification for Delayed Search:**  The main area of contention is the justification for the delay in conducting the search. The fact that the search wasn't conducted immediately and the argument was based on probable cause established by the police officer, is a sensitive issue. The Court found that police officers are not required to immediately mark the seized items upon arrest. The Court is not convinced. As a rule, under the IRR, the physical inventory and photograph of the seized items shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165, Section 5, Article II:**  Violation for transporting illegal drugs.
*   **Rule 113, Section 5, Rules of Court:**  Warrantless arrest provisions, particularly *in flagrante delicto* and "hot pursuit."
*   **Rule 124** Section 13 (c)
*   **Terry vs. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968):** Stop and Frisk situation
*   **R.A. No. 10640:** Amendment of R.A. No. 9165.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court upheld the conviction, finding that the warrantless arrest and search were valid based on the existence of probable cause.  The decision emphasizes the need for the prosecution to demonstrate a clear and unbroken chain of custody to ensure the integrity of the evidence.
