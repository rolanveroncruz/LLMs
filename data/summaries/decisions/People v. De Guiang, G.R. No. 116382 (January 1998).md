## Legal Document Summary: *People v. De Guiang*, G.R. No. 116382 (1998)

**Case Overview:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Ma. Lourdes de Guiang on charges of Illegal Recruitment (in large scale) under Art. 38 and 39 of the Labor Code and two counts of Estafa under Art. 315 of the Revised Penal Code.  The case involved three private complainants, Reynaldo Jugo, Jose Jugo, and Rosita Jugo, who were defrauded by De Guiang's false promises of employment in Japan.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Illegal Recruitment (Large Scale):** The prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that De Guiang engaged in "recruitment and placement" without the required license from the Department of Labor (now DOLE), violating Article 38, in relation to Article 13 and Article 39 of the Labor Code. The court found that at least three persons were victimized which classifies as large scale illegal recruitment.
    *   **Statutory References:** Art. 38, 39, and 13 of the Labor Code, as amended by P.D. Nos. 1412, 1693, 1920, and 2018.
*   **Estafa:** De Guiang defrauded Jose Jugo (P70,000) and Reynaldo Jugo (P20,500) by false pretenses and deceit, inducing them to pay fees for non-existent jobs and fake travel documents.
    *   **Statutory Reference:** Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Factual Basis:**  The court found the Jugos' testimonies credible, emphasizing their demeanor and consistency in recounting the transactions. De Guiang's defense, including an affidavit of desistance (later repudiated) and claims of being a legitimate contractor, was rejected as unsubstantiated and self-serving.  The court noted De Guiang's escape from custody and attempts to coerce Reynaldo Jugo into withdrawing the complaint.
*   **Penalties:** The Court upheld the penalty of Life Imprisonment and a fine of P100,000 for illegal recruitment in large scale. The Court upheld the conviction for the estafa case of Reynaldo Jugo with the penalty of  One (1) year, Eight (8) Months and Twenty-One (21) Day[s] of Prision Correccional as the minimum to Five (5) Years, Five (5) Months and Eleven (11) days as maximum of Prision Correccional in its maximum period and to pay Reynaldo Jugo the sum of P20,500.00. As well as the estafa case of Jose Jugo the court upheld the imprisonment of Four (4) years and Two (2) Months of Prision Correccional as the minimum to Six (6) years, Eight (8) Months and Twenty-One (21) days of prision correccional as the maximum plus One (1) year imprisonment for every P10,000.00 in excess of P22,000.00 and to indemnify the offended party Jose Jugo the sum of P70,000.00

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   De Guiang is obligated to serve the sentences for illegal recruitment and estafa.
*   De Guiang is liable to pay Reynaldo Jugo P20,500 and Jose Jugo P70,000 as restitution for the amounts defrauded.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** Reynaldo Jugo repudiated the affidavit of desistance, claiming it was obtained under duress. Affidavits of desistance generally carry little weight when contradicted by positive testimony (as established in various jurisprudence).
*   **Accomplice Liability (Alberto Maclang):** The defense attempted to shift blame to Alberto Maclang, but the court found De Guiang's culpability independent of Maclang's role.
*   **Ambiguous Penalty Computation:** The prision correccional penalty for one of the estafa charges includes an additional year of imprisonment for every 10,000 over P22,000.  There may be grounds to review this if the statutory limits are not properly applied.
*   **Subsidiary Imprisonment:** The subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency with respect to the fine cannot exceed 1/3 of the principal penalty

**Relevant Case Law Principles:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The assessment of witness credibility is primarily the province of the trial court, especially concerning simple, unsophisticated witnesses.
*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** An affidavit of desistance is generally considered weak and unreliable, especially when contradicted by positive testimony.
*   **Illegal Recruitment:**  The elements of illegal recruitment were thoroughly established, including acting without a license and promising employment abroad.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   There were no ambiguous or contentious clauses found.

**Recommendations:**

*   The prosecution's case appears strong and the Supreme Court's decision is unlikely to be overturned on appeal.
*   Focus should be placed on enforcing the restitution orders to compensate the victims.
*   The court should review if subsidiary imprisonment does not exceed 1/3 of the principal penalty
