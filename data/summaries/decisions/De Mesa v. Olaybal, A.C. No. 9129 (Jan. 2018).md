**Summary of *De Mesa v. Olaybal*, A.C. No. 9129 (2018)**

**Case Summary:**

This is a disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Oliver O. Olaybal for betrayal of trust, malpractice, and gross misconduct.  The complainant, Maria Eva De Mesa, alleges that Atty. Olaybal, her counsel in criminal cases for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22, misappropriated settlement funds and failed to diligently represent her.  The Supreme Court upheld the IBP's recommendation to suspend Atty. Olaybal from the practice of law for six months and ordered him to return P78,640.00 to the complainant.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Misappropriation of Funds:** The respondent received manager's checks totaling P78,640.00 from the complainant, intended for settlement with Asialink Finance Corporation.  Instead of delivering the checks, they were deposited into his personal account. The Court found his explanation of a "mistaken" deposit by his son implausible. This constitutes a violation of:

    *   **Canon 16 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** "A LAWYER SHALL HOLD IN TRUST ALL MONEYS AND PROPERTIES OF HIS CLIENT THAT MAY COME TO HIS POSSESSION."
    *   **Rule 16.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** "A lawyer shall account for all money or property collected or received for or from the client."
    *   **Rule 16.02 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** "A lawyer shall keep the funds of each client separate and apart from his own and those of others kept by him."

*   **Unauthorized Compromise Agreement:**  Atty. Olaybal entered into a compromise agreement with Asialink on behalf of the complainant without express authorization. This violates:

    *   **Canon 17 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** "A LAWYER OWES FIDELITY TO THE CAUSE OF HIS CLIENT AND HE SHALL BE MINDFUL OF THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN HIM."

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Olaybal is suspended from the practice of law for six months.** The suspension is effective upon receipt of the decision.
*   **Atty. Olaybal is ordered to return P78,640.00 to the complainant** within 30 days of receipt of the decision.
*   **Atty. Olaybal is warned that a stiffer penalty will be imposed for any future similar offenses.**
*   **Fiduciary Duty**: The court emphasizes the attorney-client relationship as highly fiduciary, requiring utmost fidelity and good faith.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The respondent argued that the checks were deposited for safekeeping without his knowledge or consent, and that he secured a more favorable settlement for the client. However, the court deemed the explanation improbable and unsubstantiated. This raises a potential risk of reliance on unsupported testimony.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22:**  The criminal cases against the complainant were for violations of this law (issuing bouncing checks).
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility:** Specifically, Canons 16, 17, and 18 and Rules 16.01 and 16.02.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Bayonla v. Reyes*, A.C. No. 4808, November 22, 2011, 660 SCRA 490, 499: Cited to reinforce the fiduciary nature of the attorney-client relationship.

**Conclusion:**

The *De Mesa v. Olaybal* case serves as a strong reminder of the ethical obligations of lawyers, particularly regarding client funds and the duty of fidelity.  The decision underscores the Court's commitment to upholding the integrity of the legal profession and protecting clients from misconduct.
