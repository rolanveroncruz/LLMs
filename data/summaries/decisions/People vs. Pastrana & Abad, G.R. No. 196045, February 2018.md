## Legal Document Summary: People v. Pastrana and Abad (G.R. No. 196045)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari seeking to reverse the CA's decision affirming the RTC's order to quash Search Warrant No. 01-118.

**Key Issue:** Validity of Search Warrant No. 01-118.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *denied* the petition, affirming the CA and RTC rulings that quashed the search warrant.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **One Specific Offense Rule Violation:** The Court held that Search Warrant No. 01-118 violated the requirement of being issued in connection with *one specific offense*. The warrant cited "violation of R.A. No. 8799 (The Securities Regulation Code)" *and* "estafa (Art. 315, RPC)."  The SRC encompasses numerous punishable acts, and even estafa has multiple modes of commission. This lack of specificity rendered the warrant invalid under *Stonehill v. Diokno* (126 Phil. 738). The court distinguishes this case from *Olaes v. People* (239 Phil. 468), *People v. Dichoso* (295 Phil. 198), and *Prudente v. Dayrit* (259 Phil. 541) on the basis that the cited SRC and RPC violations are far more broad and disaggregated. *Columbia Pictures, Inc. v. CA* (329 Phil. 875) and *Laud v. People* (747 Phil. 503) also do not apply as the search warrant here did not state one specific offense.
*   **Lack of Probable Cause for Section 28.1 SRC:** The Petitioner argued the warrant was for violation of Section 28.1 of the SRC (acting as broker/dealer without registration). The Court found that the *application* for the warrant *did not allege facts supporting a violation of Section 28.1*, specifically failing to demonstrate the lack of SEC registration.  It cited *People v. Hon. Estrada* (357 Phil. 377), emphasizing the need for "best evidence" of the negative ingredient of the offense (lack of license).
*   **Different Offenses:** Violation of Section 28.1 SRC and estafa are distinct offenses. Estafa requires defrauding and causing damage, while Section 28.1 SRC focuses on unregistered broker/dealer activity. The two offences are neither included nor necessarily including in the other. Therefore, a single search warrant is improper.
*   **Lack of Particularity:** The warrant failed to particularly describe the items to be seized. The terms were "too all-embracing," subjecting both legal and illegal documents to search and seizure. Phrases like "and other showing that these companies acted in violation of their actual registration with the SEC" provided excessive discretion to the searching officers, rendering it akin to a general warrant. Bache and Co. (Phil.), Inc. v. Judge Ruiz (148 Phil. 794).

**Statutory References:**

*   Article III, Section 2, 1987 Constitution (right against unreasonable searches and seizures)
*   Rule 126, Sections 4 and 5, 2000 Rules on Criminal Procedure (requisites for search warrants)
*   R.A. No. 8799 (Securities Regulation Code)
*   Article 315, Revised Penal Code (Estafa)

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   **Suppression of Evidence:** The evidence seized under the invalid warrant is inadmissible *Valdez v. People* (G.R. No. 170180). Any prosecutions based on this evidence will likely fail.
*   **Civil Liability:** Potential for civil suits against the officers who executed the warrant for damages related to the unlawful search and seizure.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "and other showing that these companies acted in violation of their actual registration with the SEC" in the search warrant. The Court interpreted this as overly broad and lacking in particularity, effectively granting unlimited discretion to the NBI agents.
*   The attempt by the petitioner to tie the estafa charge to the violation of the SRC. The court rejected this argument that these two offences may be tied together as one.
