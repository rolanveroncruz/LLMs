## Legal Document Summary - *BACSIN v. WAHIMAN* (G.R. No. 146053)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA decision affirming the CSC's dismissal of petitioner from service for Grave Misconduct (Acts of Sexual Harassment).

**Key Issue:** Whether the petitioner could be found guilty of Grave Misconduct (Acts of Sexual Harassment), an offense different from the initial charge of "Misconduct," and whether the penalty of dismissal was appropriate.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, affirming the CA's decision. The Court found that despite the initial charge of "Misconduct," the allegations and evidence supported a finding of Grave Misconduct under RA 7877 (Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 7877, Section 3:** Defines sexual harassment, including in an educational setting. The Court cited Section 3(b)(4), stating that sexual harassment is committed when sexual advances result in an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for the student.
*   **CSC Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases, Rule IV, Section 52:** Prescribes dismissal for the first offense of Grave Misconduct.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner:** Found liable for Grave Misconduct (Acts of Sexual Harassment) for fondling a student, violating RA 7877.
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Discrepancy in Charge:** The initial charge was "Misconduct," while the CSC found Grave Misconduct. Petitioner argued that the latter is a more serious offense and was not properly charged. *However, the Court invoked* ***Dadubo v. Civil Service Commission (223 SCRA 747)***, stating that the precision of a criminal information is not required in administrative cases, and it suffices that the respondent is apprised of the substance of the charge.
*   **Implicit vs. Explicit Demand:** Petitioner argued that RA 7877 requires a "demand, request or requirement of a sexual favor." The Court, citing ***Domingo v. Rayala***, clarified that such a demand need not be explicit and can be discerned from the offender's acts.
*   **Due Process:** Petitioner claimed denial of due process. The Court found that he was informed of the charges and had the opportunity to defend himself.
* **Whether fondling constitutes Grave Misconduct:** The Court found that fondling a student is against the law and demonstrates intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of a rule of law or standard of behavior.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7877 (Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995):** Definition of sexual harassment in educational environments.
*   **Dadubo v. Civil Service Commission (223 SCRA 747):** Standard for sufficiency of charges in administrative cases.

*   **Baylon v. Fact-finding Intelligence Bureau, G.R. No. 150870, December 11, 2002, 394 SCRA 21, 34-35.:** Definition of Grave Misconduct.
*   **Zacarias v. National Police Commission, G.R. No. 119847, October 24, 2003, 414 SCRA 387, 393:** Definition of Due Process.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** The primary contention revolves around whether the *facts*, while supporting the broad charge of *Misconduct*, rise to the level of *Grave Misconduct* such that dismissal is appropriate. The Court found that the act was grave given the relationship between a teacher and a student.
