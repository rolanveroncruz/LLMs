**Court:** Supreme Court, First Division, August 05, 2024

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan and Real Estate Mortgage:** Ruby Shelter obtained a loan from Tan and Obiedo, secured by a real estate mortgage over five parcels of land.
*   **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA):** This agreement extended the repayment period, condoned interests, penalties, and surcharges, and provided for simultaneous execution of Deeds of Absolute Sale in favor of Tan and Obiedo dated January 3, 2006. The MOA outlined two payment possibilities: direct payment by Ruby Shelter or sale of the properties if payment failed.
*   **Dacion en Pago Clause:** MOA specified that upon its execution and by way of dacion en pago, Ruby Shelter would execute Deeds of Absolute Sale.
*   **Redemption Clause:** Ruby Shelter had the option to redeem individual lots or the entire property. Upon redemption, the Deeds of Absolute Sale would be nullified.
*   **Default Clause:** If Ruby Shelter failed to tender any amount for payment, Tan and Obiedo were allowed to register the Deeds of Absolute Sale with the Registry of Deeds.
*   **Liquidated Damages:** Ruby Shelter agreed to pay PHP 10,000,000.00 as liquidated damages, inclusive of costs and attorney's fees, if it contested the MOA or the Deeds of Absolute Sale. Further, they would be liable for the condoned interest, penalties and surcharges in the amount of PHP 55,167,000.00. Ruben Sia obligated himself jointly and severally with Ruby Shelter for the payments of the entire monetary obligations.
*   **Board Resolution No. 08:** Affirms President Ruben Sia's authority to enter into the MOA and negotiate with the mortgagees.

**Obligations:**

*   **Ruby Shelter:** Original obligation to repay the loan to Tan and Obiedo. Under the MOA, Ruby Shelter had the obligation to execute deeds of absolute sale and to pay the remaining balance of PHP 95,700,620.00 by December 31, 2005, subject to the redemption conditions.
*   **Tan and Obiedo:** Original obligation as creditors. Under the MOA, obligation to conditionally waive interests, penalties and surcharges if Ruby Shelter complies with the requirements.

*   **Ruby Shelter:** The SC upheld the liquidated damages of PHP 10,000,000.00 and 6% interest from finality of the decision.
*   **Ruben Sia:** Jointly and severally liable for the monetary obligations of Ruby Shelter.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Pactum Commissorium:** Ruby Shelter argued that the MOA constitutes a pactum commissorium. However, the Supreme Court found the premise for the application of pactum commissorium absent in the case.
*   **Liquidated Damages:** Ruby Shelter's claim that the liquidated damages were unconscionable was rejected.
*   **Factual Issues:** The court noted that the petition raises factual issues inappropriate for a Rule 45 review, potentially warranting dismissal.
*   **Fraudulent Notarization:** Ruby Shelter claimed that the respondents fraudulently notarized the subject deeds of absolute sale. However, the Court ruled that the evidence was insufficient to support the claim.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The characterization of the MOA as a novation (partial vs. total) was contentious. The court determined that partial novation occurred in the first payment situation, and total novation in the second payment situation through dacion en pago.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court DENIED Ruby Shelter's petition, upholding the Amended Decision of the Court of Appeals. The Court found that the MOA effectively novated the original loan agreement by way of *dacion en pago*. The Court held that the MOA was not void for being pactum commissorium, as Ruby Shelter voluntarily offered the properties as payment and Tan and Obiedo did not automatically appropriate the properties. Ruby Shelter's obligation was extinguished by the valid *dacion en pago*. Liquidated damages of PHP 10,000,000.00 with 6% per annum interest from finality of this Decision until fully paid were awarded to Tan and Obiedo.
