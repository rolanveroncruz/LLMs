**Case Summary: *Citibank, N.A. vs. Court of Appeals and Citibank Integrated Guards Labor Alliance (CIGLA)*** (G.R. No. 108961, November 27, 1998)

**Core Issue:** Jurisdiction – Whether the Regional Trial Court (RTC) or the labor tribunals (NCMB/Labor Arbiter) have jurisdiction over Citibank's complaint for injunction and damages against CIGLA.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that the RTC has jurisdiction because the dispute is civil in nature, arising from the non-renewal of a security service contract between Citibank and El Toro Security Agency, not a labor dispute between Citibank and the security guards.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Contractual Relationship:** Citibank contracted with El Toro for security services. The contract expired and was not renewed. Citibank hired a new security agency.
*   **CIGLA's Actions:** CIGLA, a labor union representing the security guards formerly assigned to Citibank by El Toro, filed a request for preventive mediation with NCMB alleging unfair labor practice and union busting. After non-renewal of El Toro's contract, the union threatened strike action against Citibank.
*   **Citibank's Complaint:** Citibank filed a complaint in RTC for injunction and damages to prevent the strike, alleging no employer-employee relationship with the guards.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the RTC's decision, ruling that the case was a labor dispute and therefore under the jurisdiction of the labor tribunals.

**SC Rationale:**

*   **No Employer-Employee Relationship:** The SC applied the four-fold test (selection/engagement, payment of wages, power of dismissal, and control over work methods) to determine the absence of an employer-employee relationship between Citibank and the security guards. The security guards were employees of El Toro, not Citibank. Cited *Sandigan Savings and Loan Bank, Inc. v. NLRC, 254 SCRA 126; Victorias Milling Co., Inc. v. NLRC, 262 SCRA 623; Filipinas Broadcasting Network, Inc. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 118892, March 11, 1998* and *Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. NLRC, 263 SCRA 638; Georg Grotjahn GMBH & Co. vs. Isnani, 235 SCRA 216.*
*   **Not a Labor Dispute:** Defined "labor dispute" as per Article 212(l) of the Labor Code. The SC characterized the issue as a civil dispute concerning the termination/non-renewal of the service contract, not a matter of terms and conditions of employment between Citibank and its *employees*. Cited *Liwayway Publications, Inc. v. Permanent Concrete Workers Union, 108 SCRA 161; Trade Union of the Philippines & Allied Services v. Coscolluela, 140 SCRA 302 [1985].*
*   **Jurisdiction Determined by Complaint:** The SC reiterated the principle that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint. The complaint framed the dispute as a civil matter, seeking damages and an injunction based on threatened disruption due to the non-renewal of the security contract. Cited *Serdoncillo v. Benolirao, G.R. No. 118328, October 8, 1998; San Miguel Corp. v. NLRC, 255 SCRA 133; Banayos v. Susana Realty, Inc., 71 SCRA 557 [1976]; National Mines and Allied Workers Union v. Vera, 133 SCRA 259; Peñalosa v. Villanueva, 177 SCRA 778.*

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Union's Claim of ULP/Union Busting:** While the SC focused on the absence of an employer-employee relationship, CIGLA initially raised Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) and union busting claims with NCMB. If the labor tribunals had found evidence of ULP by El Toro (perhaps induced by Citibank), it could complicate the jurisdictional issue.
*   **Circumvention of Labor Laws:** The security agency arrangement could be scrutinized to determine if it was a disguised employer-employee relationship, potentially subject to scrutiny for circumvention of labor laws. (Note: This was not directly raised but is an inherent risk in such contracting arrangements).

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   **Focus on Contractual Relationship:** Citibank successfully argued the lack of employer-employee relationship. This strategy is crucial in disputes involving independent contractors.
*   **Frame the Complaint Carefully:** The allegations in the complaint dictated jurisdiction. It was imperative to characterize the dispute as stemming from a terminated contract, not a labor issue.
