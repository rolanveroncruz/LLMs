## Legal Document Summary: *Northwest Airlines v. Catapang*, G.R. No. 174364 (2009)

This case concerns a breach of contract of carriage by Northwest Airlines (NWA) against Delfin S. Catapang, a lawyer. The key issue is whether NWA improperly refused to honor the rebooking/rerouting provision on Catapang's ticket and the associated damages awarded.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract Formation:** NWA, through its agent First United Travel, Inc. (FUT), entered into a contract of carriage with Catapang. The ticket indicated a US$50 rebooking/rerouting fee.
*   **Ticket Restriction Annotation:** The ticket contained the annotation "No end./7 days adv. Purchase US$50 - rebooking/re-routing/cancellation fee".
*   **NWA's Breach:** NWA's New York office refused to honor the rebooking provision, demanding Catapang pay an additional US$644.00.
*   **Obligations of a Common Carrier:** Common carriers have the obligation to treat passengers with kindness, respect, courtesy, and due consideration.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC found NWA liable for breach of contract and awarded Catapang:
    *   US$823.00 (rebooking cost) + legal interest and Php7,372.50 (filing fees) as actual damages
    *   P800,000.00 as moral damages
    *   P100,000.00 as exemplary damages
    *   P200,000.00 as attorney's fees
    *   Cost of suit.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision but reduced moral damages to P400,000.00.
*   **SC Decision:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision with *modification*. The court deleted attorney's fees for lack of factual and legal basis. The Court also deleted the Php7,372.50 filing fee as it should be classified as "cost of suit".

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Breach of Contract of Carriage:**  The Court invokes principles relating to breach of contract. NWA's actions violated Art. 1170, Civil Code.
*   **Damages for Breach:** The court awarded moral damages, citing the rude and insulting behavior of NWA's employee, invoking *Korean Airlines Co. Ltd. vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 114061-113842, August 3, 1994, 234 SCRA 717, 723*
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The court deleted the attorney's fees, citing *Car Cool Philippines, Inc. vs. Ushio Realty and Development Corporation, G.R. No. 138088, January 23, 2006, 479 SCRA 404, 414*, because there was no factual or legal basis. See Art. 2208, Civil Code.
*   **Costs:** Rule 142, Sections 8 and 10 of the Rules of Court were used for the reclassification of filing fees as "cost of suit".

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of Ticket Restriction:** NWA argued that the US$50 rebooking fee was subject to "rules of applicability" not reflected on the ticket.  The court rejected this argument, emphasizing the plain meaning of the ticket annotation and the admission of NWA's reservation supervisor.
*   **Lack of Specificity on Ticket:**  NWA's failure to explicitly state "restricted ticket" terms on the ticket itself is a key factor in the court's decision.
*   **Employee Misconduct:**  The ruling underscores the importance of employee conduct towards passengers and the carrier's liability for such misconduct.
*   **Moral and Exemplary Damages:** The large sums awarded could be a point of contention.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Carriers are bound by the terms of the tickets they issue, and ambiguous restrictions are construed against them.
*   Employee misconduct can significantly increase a carrier's liability.
*   Vague contract terms can lead to liability for damages, even if the carrier believes there is no breach.
