**Court:** Supreme Court, Third Division

**Date:** February 28, 2024

**Subject Matter:** Administrative case against a Court Stenographer I, Lorna M. Martin, for dishonesty (falsification of DTRs) and insubordination.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

    *   The Court emphasized that truthful and accurate completion of DTR is a personal undertaking and failure to declare truthfully is not only dishonesty but blatant disregard to office rules.
    *   The Court considered the act of falsification as serious dishonesty and gross misconduct, a serious charge under Section 14 of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Insubordination:** Martin was found guilty of gross insubordination for refusing a direct order from Judge Gandia-Asuncion to report to her chambers regarding discrepancies in her DTR.
    *   The Court defined gross insubordination as inexplicable and unjustified refusal to obey some order that a superior is entitled to give and have obeyed, and imports a willful or intentional disregard of the lawful and reasonable instructions of a superior.
*   **Applicable Law:** The Court applied Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 18-01-05-SC and A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC.
*   **Penalty for Multiple Offenses:** The Court highlighted Section 21 of Rule 140 which discusses the penalty for multiple offenses.

**Risks:**

*   **Precedent:** This case reinforces the stringent standard of conduct expected of court employees and the consequences of dishonesty and insubordination.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Hon. Gandia-Asuncion v. Martin, A.M. No. P-22-042, June 28, 2022:** This case also involved Lorna M. Martin. This was taken into account by the Court in this case.
*   **Office of the Court Administrator v. Kasilag, 688 Phil. 232, 238 (2012):** Jurisprudence is clear in that the falsification through tampering of an official document such as the DTR is a form of dishonesty that amounts to a grave offense.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   While not necessarily "ambiguous", the Court had to distinguish the prior case, Hon. Gandia-Asuncion v. Martin, A.M. No. P-22-042, June 28, 2022 from the present one, considering they involved similar actions, same personalities but different incidents.

**Outcome:**

The Court found Lorna M. Martin guilty of serious dishonesty and gross misconduct, imposing a fine of PHP 200,000.00. She was also found guilty of gross insubordination and meted out a penalty of fine of PHP 110,000.00. Because of a previous case, there was an imposition of the penalty of dismissal.
