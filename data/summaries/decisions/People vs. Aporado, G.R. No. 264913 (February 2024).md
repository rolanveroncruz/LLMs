## Legal Document Summary: People v. Aporado, G.R. No. 264913

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court reviewed the conviction of Ronald Aporado for murder. The CA affirmed the RTC's decision. Aporado admitted to stabbing the victim, Amado Halasan, but argued lack of treachery and presence of mitigating circumstances. The SC modified the conviction to homicide.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Admission of Guilt:** Aporado admitted to stabbing the victim, shifting the burden to him to prove justification or mitigating circumstances. *People v. Hubilla, Jr.*
*   **Elements of Murder:** Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), murder requires the presence of qualifying circumstances, such as treachery.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** Requires (1) employment of means ensuring execution without risk to the offender (objective element) and (2) deliberate choice of such means (subjective element). *People v. Marzan; People v. Domingo*. The Court stated that to constitute alevosia, the offender must plan the mode of attack and cannot spring from an unexpected turn of events. *People v. Ilo; People v. Magbuhos*
*   **Mitigating Circumstances (Article 13, RPC):** Aporado claimed sufficient provocation, passion and obfuscation, voluntary surrender, and intoxication.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Initial Conviction (RTC & CA):** Murder, penalized under Article 248 of the RPC.
*   **Modified Conviction (SC):** Homicide, penalized under Article 249 of the RPC. Reclusion temporal is prescribed for homicide.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law Application:** Because the crime was reduced to homicide, the penalty next lower in degree is prision mayor. Ronald was sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 8 years and 1 day of prision mayor, as minimum, to 14 years, 8 months, and 1 day of reclusion temporal, as maximum.
*   **Damages:** Modified to civil indemnity (₱50,000), moral damages (₱50,000), and temperate damages (₱50,000). 6% interest per annum from finality until full payment. *People v. Jugueta*.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Treachery Ruling:** The SC found insufficient evidence of treachery because the attack was deemed an impulsive reaction to provocation, lacking the deliberate planning required for the subjective element. *People v. Sabanal*. This hinges on interpreting Aporado's actions as a direct and unplanned response to the teasing.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances Rejection:** The SC found the mitigating circumstances claimed to be lacking or unproven. This is a crucial point, as their presence would have further reduced the sentence.
    *   **Sufficient Provocation:** The teasing was not considered "sufficient" or "grave" enough to merit deadly retaliation. *People v. Nabora*. Further, there was a time lapse between the teasing and stabbing which negates sufficient provocation.*People v. Tan*.
    *   **Passion and Obfuscation:** The teasing was not considered an unlawful act sufficient to produce such obfuscation. *People v. Javier*. Additionally, the passion originated from a wounded ego rather than lawful feelings. *People v. Rabanillo*.
    *   **Voluntary Surrender:** Janilo, a barangay tanod chased and arrested Ronald. Thus, he did not voluntarily surrender. *Roca v. CA*.
    *   **Intoxication:** Insufficient evidence was presented to prove the degree and effect of Ronald's intoxication on his reasoning and intelligence. Medical evidence and specifics of alcohol intake were lacking. *People v. Bermudo*.
