**Case Summary: Spouses Sicad v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125888, August 13, 1998 (355 Phil. 616)**

**Facts:**

*   Aurora Montinola executed a deed entitled "DEED OF DONATION INTER VIVOS" in 1979 in favor of her grandchildren (Valderramas), covering a parcel of land (TCT No. T-16105). The donees accepted the donation, and a new TCT (No. T-16622) was issued in their names. However, Montinola retained the owner's duplicate and possession of the property.
*   In 1987, Montinola executed a Deed of Revocation and had it annotated on the title. In 1990, she filed a petition to cancel TCT No. T-16622 and reinstate TCT No. T-16105, arguing the donation was *mortis causa* and thus void for failing to comply with will formalities (Special Proceeding No. 3311).
*   The trial court ruled the donation was *inter vivos* and dismissed Montinola's petition.
*   Montinola appealed.  While the appeal was pending, Montinola died. The Sicads sought substitution, claiming ownership via a "deed of definite sale" from Montinola in 1992, confirmed by a later affidavit. Montinola's legal heirs initially moved to withdraw the appeal but later joined the Sicads.
*   The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the trial court, finding the donation *inter vivos*.

**Issue:**

*   Was the Deed of Donation executed by Montinola *inter vivos* or *mortis causa*?  Did the CA err in not giving due weight to the revocation of the donation or ordering further reception of evidence?

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA, holding the donation was *mortis causa* and therefore void for non-compliance with the formalities of a will.  TCT No. T-16622 was ordered canceled, and TCT No. T-16105 reinstated.

**Key Provisions and Analysis:**

*   **Nature of Donation:** The SC relied heavily on the circumstances surrounding the donation and the donor's intent.  The donor's actions indicated intent to transfer the property only after her death, despite the deed's title. Key factors include:
    *   **Retention of Ownership Rights:** Montinola retained possession, enjoyed fruits, paid taxes, and retained the title.
    *   **Restriction on Disposition:** The clause prohibiting sale/encumbrance for 10 years *after Montinola's death* was critical, indicating a transfer of rights only upon death, consistent with a donation *mortis causa*.
    *   **Subsequent Actions:** Montinola's later attempts to revoke the donation and sell the property to the Sicads further evidenced her belief that she retained ownership.
*   **Case Law:**
    *   **David v. Sison, 76 Phil. 418 (1946) & Bonsato v. Court of Appeals, 95 Phil. 481 (1954):** These cases established that reservation of fruits and restrictions on the donee's right to dispose of the property during the donor's lifetime are strong indicators of a donation *mortis causa*.  The court distinguished *Alejandro v. Geraldez, 78 SCRA 245* as involving a partial relinquishment of disposal rights, implying ownership had passed to the donees during the donor's lifetime. The court distinguished *Castro v. Court of Appeals, 27 SCRA 1084*, where no such prohibition of disposal was imposed
*   **Statutory Reference:**
    *   **Article 1378 of the Civil Code:** Construing gratuitous contracts to entail the least transmission of rights and interests in case of doubt.
*   **Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses:**
    *   The clause prohibiting sale/encumbrance for 10 years *after* the donor's death was the most contentious. While framed as a condition, the SC interpreted it as evidencing the donor's intent to defer the transfer of ownership until after her death.
    *   The "Deed of Donation Inter Vivos" title was misleading, as the substance of the deed and subsequent actions contradicted the label.
    *   Annotation of Revocation: Validity of the revocation was not directly addressed, as the core finding was the initial invalidity of the transfer.
*   Ingratitude committed by donee: The basis of the revocation was based on ingratitude which would consist of utterances of defamatory words by the donee.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   **Sicads' Claim of Ownership:** The SC's ruling invalidates the "deed of definite sale" from Montinola to the Sicads, as Montinola had no valid title to convey. The Sicads' ownership claim is therefore jeopardized. The Sicads were not good-faith purchasers, since the title was already under dispute.
*   **Donees' Rights:** The Valderramas (donees) seemingly lost any interest since donation *mortis causa* must follow formalities for a will, which it did not.
*   **Legal Heirs' Rights:** The ruling opens the possibility for a determination of the rights of Montinola's legal heirs (Ofelia M. de Leon, Estela M. Jaen and Teresita M. Valderrama) to the property based on a will

**Recommendations:**

*   The Sicads should consider pursuing a claim against Montinola's estate for breach of contract or misrepresentation regarding the "deed of definite sale."
*   Assess the validity of revocation: If legal heirs plan on disposing of the property, legal counsel should assess whether the revocation was valid.
