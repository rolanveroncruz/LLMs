## Legal Document Summary: *A.M. No. RTJ-90-483 and A.M. No. RTJ-90-617*

**Nature:** Consolidated administrative complaints against Judge Adriano Villamor for serious misconduct, ignorance of the law, knowingly rendering an unjust judgment, misfeasance, malfeasance, and neglect of duty arising from a direct contempt order.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   The complaints stem from Judge Villamor's Order dated December 11, 1987, declaring Atty. Antonio Guerrero and George Carlos in direct contempt for alleged derogatory language in a civil complaint filed in a different court (Cebu).
*   Complainants allege the contempt order was issued without due process (no information of charge, no hearing, no show cause order), and violated Rule 71 of the Rules of Court.
*   Judge Villamor's defense is essentially "error in judgment" citing a prior SC decision regarding the same events where it was deemed at most, he was in error.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   The primary liability is administrative: possible disciplinary action against Judge Villamor.
*   Complainants sought to establish bad faith, malice, or corrupt purpose on the part of Judge Villamor. Failure to prove these elements is fatal to their case.
*   Risk of administrative liability exists if the judge's actions were not merely erroneous but motivated by bad faith, dishonesty, hatred, or similar motives (per *Dela Cruz vs. Concepcion, 235 SCRA 597* and *Heirs of the Late Nasser D. Yasin vs. Felix, 250 SCRA 545*).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 71 of the Rules of Court:** Governs contempt proceedings. Violation is alleged.
*   **Ang vs. Castro, 136 SCRA 453:** Defines direct vs. indirect contempt. Crucial, as the alleged contemptuous language was in a pleading filed in a different court, making direct contempt highly questionable.
*   **Lagumbay vs. COMELEC, 16 SCRA 175 & Surigao Mineral Reservation Board vs. Cloribel, 31 SCRA 1:** Cited by Judge Villamor, but complainants argue they are irrelevant. The Court finds they are not entirely misplaced and were cited to accentuate the effects of intemperate language.
*   **Hon. Judge Adriano Villamor vs. Hon. Judge Bernardo Ll. Salas & George Carlos and Hon. Judge Adriano Villamor vs. Antonio Guerrero & Hon. Peary G. Aleonar, 203 SCRA 540:** Precedent where SC already deemed the order of contempt an error of judgment for which Judge Villamor cannot be held civilly or criminally liable.
*   **Revita vs. Rimando, 98 SCRA 619 and Dela Cruz vs. Concepcion, 235 SCRA 597:** Defines when administrative liability attaches for ignorance of law.
*   **Re: Judge Silverio S. Tayao, RTC, Branch 143, Makati, 229 SCRA 723:** Establishes that a judge may not be administratively charged for mere errors of judgment, in the absence of showing of any bad faith, malice or corrupt purpose.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Direct vs. Indirect Contempt:** Whether the statements made in the Cebu court complaint constituted direct contempt *in facie curiae* is highly questionable and key to the complaints. *Ang vs. Castro* suggests it's indirect contempt, requiring different procedures.
*   **Bad Faith:** The success of the complaints hinges on proving Judge Villamor acted in bad faith. The strained relationship between the parties and the prior legal battles provide context, but complainants must demonstrate that these factors *motivated* the contempt order.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court dismissed the administrative complaints, finding the Judge's actions to be an error in judgment, without the element of bad faith necessary for disciplinary action, malice afterthought or ill-will . The gratuity granted is therefore upheld.
