**Case Summary: People v. Alkodha, G.R. No. 178067 (2008)**

**Legal Issue:** Appeal of conviction for two counts of rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charges:** Two counts of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, committed through force, threat, or intimidation, aggravated by abuse of superior strength, nighttime, and dwelling.
*   **Evidence:** Prosecution presented victim's testimony (AAA) and medical evidence (Dr. Palmero) of fresh hymenal laceration and chest abrasions consistent with recent sexual intercourse and loss of virginity. Defense presented alibi and denial.
*   **Lower Court Holdings:** RTC and CA both found Alkodha guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* for each count and ordering civil indemnity (P50,000), moral damages (P50,000), and exemplary damages (P25,000) per count.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant (Alkodha):** Found liable for two counts of rape, subject to *reclusion perpetua* and monetary damages.

**Potential Risks & Issues:**

*   **Inconsistencies in Victim's Testimony:** Accused-appellant argued that there were inconsistencies in the victim's testimony and a potential for improper motive which the court dismissed as trivial and explained that affidavits are generally subordinate in importance to open court declarations.
*   **Credibility of Witness Testimony:** Accused-appellant contended that there were inconsistencies in witness (SPO2 Bautista) testimony.
*   **Alibi:** Alkodha presented an alibi defense. The court found the alibi to be weak and ineffective because it was deemed physically possible for Alkodha to travel to the scene of the crime.

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 266-A (Rape):** Defines the crime of rape.
