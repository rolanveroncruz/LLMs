**Case Summary: *Becmen Service Exporter and Promotion, Inc. v. Spouses Cuaresma***

**Citation:** 602 Phil. 1058 (G.R. Nos. 182978-79 & 184298-99, April 7, 2009)

**Facts:** Jasmin Cuaresma, deployed as a nurse to Saudi Arabia by Becmen, died under suspicious circumstances in her dormitory. Conflicting autopsy reports exist: one from Saudi Arabia suggesting poisoning/likely suicide, and another from the Philippines indicating violent physical assault. The Cuaresmas (Jasmin's parents) sued Becmen and its new recruitment agency White Falcon, seeking death benefits, damages, and insurance.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Employment Agreement:** Stipulates monthly salary, free air tickets, transportation, accommodation, and medical treatment. *Caveat:* No explicit provisions for insurance or death benefits.
*   **RA 8042 (Migrant Workers Act):** Mandates the State to protect the dignity and welfare of OFWs. This imposed a legal responsibility on Becmen and White Falcon to provide aid to distressed deployed OFW's, which they failed to do.
*   **Joint and Solidary Liability:** The Court confirms that recruitment agencies (Becmen, White Falcon) are jointly and solidarily liable with the foreign employer (Rajab) for violations of employment agreements and damages. R.A. 8042 Section 10 also states that “If the recruitment/placement agency is a juridical being, the corporate officers and directors and partners as the case may be, shall themselves be jointly and solidarily liable with the corporation or partnership for the aforesaid claims and damages.”
*   **Solidary Obligation and White Falcon's Assumption of Liability:** White Falcon's assumption of Becmen's liabilities under contract law, does not automatically result in Becmen's freedom or release from liability. (ABD Overseas Manpower Corporation v. NLRC)
*   **Moral Damages (Art. 2219(10) Civil Code):** Awarded due to the employer's misconduct and acts contrary to morals, good customs, and public policy. (Maneja v. National Labor Relations Commission)
*   **Civil Code Arts. 19, 21, 24:** Emphasize acting with justice, good faith, and protecting the disadvantaged party.
*   **Civil Code Arts. 1700, 1701, 1702:** Emphasize that labor is impressed with public interest and that capital and labor shall not act oppressively against each other.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Supreme Court held Rajab & Silsilah Company, White Falcon Services, Inc., Becmen Service Exporter and Promotion, Inc., and their corporate directors and officers are found jointly and solidarily liable to indemnify the heirs of Jasmin Cuaresma, spouses Simplicio and Mila Cuaresma, the following amounts:
    *   P2,500,000.00 as moral damages;
    *   P2,500,000.00 as exemplary damages;
    *   Attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award; and,
    *   Costs of suit.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Autopsy Reports:** The Saudi report suggests poisoning (potentially suicide), while the Philippine report indicates physical assault. The Supreme Court strongly favored the Philippine autopsy in light of local social and international context of OFW abuses.
*   **"Work-Related Death":** Although the death occurred in the dormitory, the Supreme Court found it not work-related for purposes of statutory benefits under the contract. *Crucially, the Court found that the death did not appear to be suicide.*
*   **Damages vs. Benefits:** The Court rejects awarding lost earnings or damages equivalent to insurance, but awarded moral and exemplary damages based on the employer's insensitive handling of the situation and failure to protect the OFW’s welfare and the imposition of an unwarranted claim of suicide.
*   **Typographical Error in Contract (IQAMA):** The Court acknowledged Becmen's admission of a typographical error regarding "Iqama Insurance" since "Iqama" is not an insurance. However, this does not negate other liabilities for damages based on RA 8042 and related Civil Code provisions.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8042 (Migrant Workers Act)**
*   **Civil Code Articles 19, 21, 24, 1700, 1701, 1702, and 2219(10)**
*   **Interorient Maritime Enterprises, Inc. v. NLRC,**
*   **ABD Overseas Manpower Corporation v. NLRC.**
*   **Delos Santos v. Jebsen Maritime, Inc.**
*   **Maneja v. National Labor Relations Commission**
*   **Sevillana v. I.T. (International) Corp.**
*   **Royal Crown Internationale v. NLRC**
*   **Philippine National Bank v. Cabansag**
*   **Tiongco v. Deguma**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The nature of Jasmin's death remained a key point of contention, with the company's reliance on the Saudi autopsy and subsequent accusation of suicide as a means to absolve liability. This was overturned and frowned upon by the Court.

**Legal Strategy Considerations (For the Cuaresmas):**

*   The ruling establishes strong precedent regarding the duty of recruitment agencies to protect and advocate for their OFWs, even after deployment.
*   The award of moral and exemplary damages is significant and can be leveraged in future cases involving similar negligence and insensitivity.

**Legal Strategy Considerations (For Becmen/White Falcon):**

*   The joint and solidary liability requires careful assessment of asset distribution and potential contribution/indemnification agreements.
*   Consider exploring settlement options to mitigate further damage to reputation and prevent similar claims.
