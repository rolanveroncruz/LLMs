**Case Summary: People v. Manlao, G.R. No. 234023 (2018)**

**Legal Issue:** Whether the accused-appellant, Jennie Manlao y Laquila, is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Qualified Theft under Article 310 in relation to Article 309 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Facts:** The accused, a housemaid, was charged with Qualified Theft for stealing jewelry and watches (valued at ₱1,849,000.00, later reduced to ₱1,189,000.00) from her employer's residence. The prosecution's key witness was another housemaid who saw the accused opening a locked drawer and taking the items after receiving a suspicious phone call. The accused claimed she was tricked into believing her employers had an accident and was instructed by a supposed employer over the phone to take the valuables.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the accused's conviction for Qualified Theft but modified the penalty, taking into account the enactment of Republic Act No. (RA) 10951, which adjusted the value of property on which theft penalties are based. The Court found all the elements of Qualified Theft present: unlawful taking, ownership by another, intent to gain, lack of consent, no violence/intimidation/force, and the commission by a domestic servant. The Court ruled that intent to gain was presumed due to the unlawful taking, and the accused's defense of being tricked was unconvincing.

**Key Provisions & Liabilities:**

*   **Article 310, RPC (Qualified Theft):**  Defines Qualified Theft and prescribes penalties two degrees higher than simple theft when committed by a domestic servant, or with grave abuse of confidence, or other circumstances.
*   **Article 309, RPC (Theft Penalties):**  Prescribes penalties for theft based on the value of the stolen property. Amended by RA 10951.
*   **RA 10951:**  Adjusts the value thresholds in Article 309, RPC, leading to a potentially lower penalty than under the original RPC. Retroactive application favors the accused.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:**  Applied to determine the minimum and maximum terms of imprisonment.

**Penalty Imposed (as modified by SC):**

*   Imprisonment for an indeterminate period of seven (7) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of *prision mayor*, as minimum, to eleven (11) years, six (6) months, and twenty-one (21) days of *reclusion temporal*, as maximum.
*   Payment of ₱1,189,000.00 as actual damages, with legal interest at 6% per annum from the finality of the decision until full payment.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Valuation of Stolen Items:** The initial valuation of ₱1,849,000.00 was based on the victim's estimates. The court reduced this to ₱1,189,000.00 based on pictures, which could be a point of contention if insufficient evidence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **People v. Dahil, 750 Phil. 212 (2015):** Affirms the principle that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review.
*   **People v. Cabanada, G.R. No. 221424, July 19, 2017:** Reaffirms that intent to gain is presumed from the proven unlawful taking.
