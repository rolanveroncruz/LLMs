**Nature:** Administrative matter regarding alleged unreasonable delay in the disposition of Civil Case No. 91-126 (Community Development Corporation v. Asian Bank) by Judge Guillermo R. Andaya.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Duty to Expedite Proceedings:** Reiterates the judiciary's responsibility to provide just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of cases, as per Rule 1, Section 2 of the Rules of Court and Article VIII, Section 15 of the Constitution.
*   **Prohibition of Dilatory Tactics:** Judges are to avoid delays and repudiate dilatory tactics.
*   **Timely Resolution of Motions:**  Motions must be resolved in a timely manner. Judge Andaya's failure to resolve a Motion to Dismiss for over four years was a key issue.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Neglect of Duty:** Judge Andaya was found liable for neglect of duty due to the significant delay in resolving the case.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Repetitive Similar Acts:** A repetition of similar acts will be dealt with more severely.
*   **Erosion of Public Confidence:** Undue delays contribute to the erosion of public confidence in the judiciary.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 1, Sec. 2 of the Rules of Court:** Emphasizes the objective of the Rules to secure a just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.
*   **Article VIII, Section 15 of the Constitution:** Requires the Supreme Court to promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the case acknowledges the judge's heavy caseload (being assigned to multiple branches and designated to hear heinous crimes), this was not accepted as a valid excuse for the significant delay. This highlights the tension between the demands on judges and their duty to expedite cases.

**Outcome:**

*   The Court resolved to **REPRIMAND** Judge Guillermo R. Andaya for neglect of duty.

**Legal Precision:**

The case serves as a reminder to judges of their duty to expedite cases, resolving pending motions and pleadings promptly and ensuring that delays are minimized, even in the face of heavy workloads. The Court emphasized that the judiciary must restore the full confidence of the people.
