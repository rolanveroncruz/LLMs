## Legal Document Summary: Corpuz vs. Citibank (G.R. Nos. 175677 & 177133)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision resolving consolidated petitions for review of Court of Appeals (CA) decisions regarding dismissal of a Complaint for Damages and a Compulsory Counterclaim.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners (Spouses Corpuz):** Plaintiffs in the original action against Citibank for damages arising from alleged wrongful dishonor of credit cards.
*   **Respondent (Citibank, N.A.):** Defendant in the original action, and counterclaimant for unspecified damages.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **G.R. No. 175677 (Spouses' Petition):**
    *   **Issue:** Propriety of the CA's upholding the RTC's dismissal of the Spouses' Complaint due to their failure to attend the pre-trial conference.
    *   **Ruling:** The SC affirmed the CA, holding that the dismissal was proper under Rule 18, Section 5 of the Rules of Court (failure to appear at pre-trial), and the proper remedy was an ordinary appeal, not certiorari. The SC found no valid excuse for the spouses' non-appearance, citing *Quelnan v. VHF Philippines*, where failure to properly calendar a pre-trial does not constitute excusable negligence.
    *   **Relevant Case Law:** *Quelnan v. VHF Philippines* (G.R. No. 145911), *Pinga v. Heirs of German Santiago* (G.R. No. 170354), *BA Finance v. Co* (G.R. No. 105751), *Perkin Elmer Singapore v. Dakila Trading* (G.R. No. 172242)
    *   **Statutory References:** Rule 18, Sections 4 & 5; Rule 17, Section 3 of the Rules of Court.
*   **G.R. No. 177133 (Citibank's Petition):**
    *   **Issue:** Propriety of the CA's affirming the RTC's dismissal of Citibank's Compulsory Counterclaim due to failure to present evidence within the prescribed period.
    *   **Ruling:** SC denied Citibank's motion for reconsideration, effectively affirming the dismissal. Citibank failed to present evidence on its counterclaim within the 30-day period ordered by the trial court and did not timely seek reconsideration of the denial of its motion to defer presentation of evidence.
    *   **Statutory References:** Rule 65, Section 7; Rule 31, Section 9 of the Rules of Court.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Spouses Corpuz:** Liable for costs in both petitions. Their Complaint is dismissed with prejudice.
*   **Citibank:** Liable for costs in both petitions. Its Counterclaim is dismissed. Had the obligation to present evidence within the prescribed timeframe, and failed to do so.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Spouses Corpuz:** No further avenue to pursue their claim for damages against Citibank based on the dishonored credit cards.
*   **Citibank:** Loss of opportunity to recover on its Counterclaim against the spouses.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of Rule 17, Section 3 and Rule 18, Section 5 regarding the ability of a defendant to prosecute a counterclaim after the plaintiff's complaint is dismissed. The SC clarified that *Pinga* and *Perkin Elmer* support the view that the dismissal of the complaint due to the plaintiff's fault does not necessarily carry with it the dismissal of the counterclaim. However, Citibank's failure to timely present evidence waived that right.

**Key Takeaways/Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of both the spouses' claim and Citibank's counterclaim due to procedural errors and failures to comply with court orders. The spouses failed to attend the pre-trial conference, and Citibank failed to present evidence on its counterclaim within the allotted time. This case highlights the importance of adhering to procedural rules and deadlines in litigation. The consolidation of cases shows the need for consistency and legal understanding regarding the deadlines in the prosecution of the case.
