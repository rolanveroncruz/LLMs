**Legal Document Summary - A.M. No. RTJ-07-2074**

**Nature:** Administrative case concerning irregularities in the handling of petitions for voluntary confinement and rehabilitation of drug dependents.

**Key Issue:** Failure to adhere to established procedures for the raffle of cases, specifically Supreme Court Circular No. 7 (Sept. 23, 1974) and Administrative Circular No. 1 (Jan. 28, 1988), as well as Section 2, Rule 20 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, resulting in cases being improperly assigned to a specific branch.

**Respondents & Findings:**

*   **Ret. Judge Ireneo Lee Gako, Jr.:** Found culpable for acting without authority on cases not properly raffled to his branch, violating SC rules/circulars. Prior offenses cited, increasing the severity of the penalty. *Penalty:* Fined PhP 40,000 deducted from retirement benefits. Previous administrative convictions show a pattern of disregarding court rules (e.g. *Joselito Rallos, et al. v. Judge Ireneo Gako, Jr.*; *Ronaldo B. Zamora v. Judge Ireneo Gako, Jr.*; *Doroteo Lagcao, et al. v. Judge Ireneo Gako, Jr.*; *City of Cebu v. Judge Ireneo Gako, Jr.*).
*   **Monica V. Dionaldo (Admin. Officer):** Responsible for the initial irregularity by forwarding cases directly to Branch 5 without proper raffle. *Penalty:* Fine equivalent to two months' salary, deducted from retirement benefits.
*   **Nilda D. Suyko (Legal Researcher):** Failed to verify proper assignment of cases to Branch 5 before processing them. *Penalty:* Fine equivalent to one month and one day's salary, stern warning.
*   **Atty. Jeoffrey S. Joaquino (Clerk of Court):** Neglect of supervisory duty over Dionaldo. *Penalty:* Reprimand, stern warning.
*   **Atty. Manuel G. Nollora (Branch Clerk of Court):** Neglect of supervisory duty over Suyko. *Penalty:* Reprimand, stern warning.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   Strict adherence to Supreme Court Circular No. 7 and Adm. Circular No. 1 regarding raffle procedures.
*   Duty of judges, clerks of court, and staff to ensure proper case assignment via raffle (Section 2, Rule 20, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure).
*   Supervisory responsibilities of clerks of court over subordinate staff regarding procedural compliance.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative liability for violation of court rules and circulars.
*   Potential for financial penalties (fines).
*   Disciplinary actions (reprimand, warning).

**Potential Risks:**

*   Erosion of public trust in the impartiality of the judiciary.
*   Undermining the integrity of case assignment procedures.
*   Prejudice to parties due to improper case assignment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Supreme Court Circular No. 7 (Sept. 23, 1974), as amended by Circular No. 20 (Oct. 4, 1979).
*   Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 1 (Jan. 28, 1988).
*   Section 2, Rule 20, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.
*   Cases cited (e.g. *Atty. Hilario v. Hon. Ocampo III*, *Opis v. Dimaano*, *Medina v. De Guia*).
*   Previous Administrative Cases against Judge Gako (e.g. *Joselito Rallos, et al. v. Judge Ireneo Gako, Jr.*; *Ronaldo B. Zamora v. Judge Ireneo Gako, Jr.*; *Doroteo Lagcao, et al. v. Judge Ireneo Gako, Jr.*; *City of Cebu v. Judge Ireneo Gako, Jr.*).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The judge's claim of lack of knowledge regarding the non-raffle, which the Court found unpersuasive considering the volume and duration of the irregularities. The Court essentially asserts a duty of inquiry and constructive knowledge on the part of the Judge.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the findings of the Executive Justice, with a modification to increase the fine imposed on Judge Gako, Jr. due to prior disciplinary actions. The case underscores the importance of strict adherence to established procedures for case raffling and the supervisory responsibilities of court personnel.
