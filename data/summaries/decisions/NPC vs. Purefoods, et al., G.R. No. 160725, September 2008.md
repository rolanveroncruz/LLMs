**Case Summary: National Power Corporation vs. Purefoods Corporation, et al. (G.R. No. 160725, September 12, 2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision in an eminent domain case, fixing just compensation for right-of-way easement.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Expropriation by NAPOCOR of easements of right-of-way over parcels of land in Bulacan for its Northwestern Luzon Project (San Jose-San Manuel 500 KV Transmission Line Project).
*   **Affected Properties:** Lands owned by Purefoods, SDC, Jose Ortega, Jr., Silvestre Bautista, Alfredo Cabande, Heirs of Victor Trinidad, and Moldex Realty Incorporated, totaling 62,426.50 sq.m.
*   **Just Compensation:** RTC fixed compensation at P600.00/sq m for Moldex property and P400.00/sq m for other respondents. CA affirmed. NAPOCOR argued for easement fee limited to 10% of market value as per RA 6395, as amended, and RA 8974 implementing regulations.
*   **Interest:** Ordered by RTC at 6% per annum from January 6, 1998, until finality, then 12% per annum until full payment.  The appellate court affirmed, modifying only the period the 12% interest would accrue.
*   **Compromise Agreement:** NAPOCOR entered into a compromise agreement with Moldex, leading to partial withdrawal of the petition concerning Moldex only.

**Obligations:**

*   **NAPOCOR:** Payment of just compensation based on full market value, as determined by the RTC and affirmed by the CA, plus legal interest. Obligation to compensate for improvements actually damaged.
*   **Landowners:** Granting NAPOCOR right-of-way easement upon payment of just compensation.

**Liabilities:**

*   NAPOCOR is liable for just compensation based on fair market value rather than a simple easement fee (10%). NAPOCOR is liable for 6% interest before finality and 12% interest post-finality.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Valuation Dispute:** NAPOCOR's main contention revolves around whether just compensation should be based on the full market value or a percentage thereof, citing statutory provisions versus established case law on just compensation.
*   **Applicability of Easement Fee Limitation:** NAPOCOR attempts to limit compensation using RA 6395 (amended by PD 938), Section 3A and implementing regulations of RA 8974, arguing that only an easement is being acquired. This argument is contradicted by case law.
*   **Commissioners' Report:** NAPOCOR challenges reliance on the commissioners' report, arguing it was based on insufficient evidence.
*   **Interest Calculation:** NAPOCOR contests the imposed interest rates, particularly the post-finality rate.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **National Power Corporation v. Manubay Agro-Industrial Development Corporation (G.R. No. 150936, 2004):**  Establishes that just compensation for right-of-way easements depriving normal land use for an indefinite period should be based on full market value, not just an easement fee.
*   **National Power Corporation v. Aguirre-Paderanga (G.R. No. 155065, 2005):**  Reinforces that expropriation includes restrictions/limitations on property rights, entitling landowner to more than a nominal (10%) easement fee.
*   **Republic v. PLDT** (Cited within Manubay): Power of eminent domain may be used to impose a burden on property, such as a right-of-way.
*   **Export Processing Zone Authority v. Dulay (G.R. No. L-59603, 1987):** Reaffirms that the determination of just compensation is a judicial function, and statutory valuations are merely guiding principles.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6395 (as amended by Presidential Decree No. 938), Section 3A:** NAPOCOR's primary basis for claiming a 10% easement fee.
*   **Republic Act No. 8974:**  Implementing regulations related to right-of-way acquisition for national government infrastructure projects.
*   **Rule 67, Section 8 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Provides the court's discretion in dealing with the report of the commissioners in eminent domain cases.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main point of contention is the applicability of Section 3A of RA 6395 (as amended), which provides for a 10% easement fee, versus the established legal precedent requiring just compensation based on the full market value when the right-of-way easement effectively deprives the landowner of normal land use.

**Legal Analysis/Recommendations:**

NAPOCOR's position is weak given the established case law. The Court is likely to uphold the determination of just compensation based on full market value, especially considering the potential for indefinite restriction on land use. NAPOCOR's argument relying on Section 3A of RA 6395, as amended, will likely fail as the courts have repeatedly held that the determination of just compensation is a judicial function. Focus on the commissioners' report and whether the valuations they came to were supported by the evidence. Any challenge to interest rates would need to carefully consider the timing of the taking and any delays in payment.
