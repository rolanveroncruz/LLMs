**Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 169338 (New Bian Yek Commercial, Inc. vs. Office of the Ombudsman)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing the Ombudsman's finding of no probable cause for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contract:** Municipality of Valencia awarded a contract to Legacy Construction for a waterworks system improvement.
*   **Supplier:** New Bian Yek Commercial, Inc. (Petitioner) supplied pipes to Legacy.
*   **Payment Issue:** Legacy's checks to Petitioner bounced.
*   **Retention Money:** Petitioner requested the Municipality (Mayor Gonzales) to pay from the project's retention money.
*   **Provincial Attorney's Opinion:** Provincial Attorney Vergara advised releasing the retention money to Legacy.
*   **Writ of Preliminary Attachment:** RTC issued a writ prohibiting the Municipality from releasing the retention money to Legacy due to Petitioner's suit for sum of money.
*   **Release of Funds:** Despite the writ, Mayor Gonzales instructed Municipal Treasurer Obañana to release the retention money to Legacy.
*   **Ombudsman's Decision:** Initially found no probable cause against Gonzales, Vergara, and Obañana, citing good faith reliance on Vergara's opinion.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Municipality's Obligation:** Obligated to respect the writ of preliminary attachment issued by the RTC, preventing the release of funds subject to the writ (retention money).
*   **Mayor Gonzales & Treasurer Obañana:** Potentially liable under Section 3(e) of RA 3019 for causing undue injury to the Petitioner and extending unwarranted benefits to Legacy by releasing the retention money despite the writ.
*   **Legacy (Alex & Dominador Abelido):** Potentially liable in conspiracy with the public officials for receiving funds subject to a valid writ of attachment to the detriment of the creditor (Petitioner).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Charges:** Gonzales, Obañana, and the Abelidos face potential criminal prosecution for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.
*   **Civil Liability:** Potential for civil liability for damages to New Bian Yek Commercial due to the wrongful release of funds that were subject to attachment.
*   **Ombudsman's Discretion:** While the Court generally defers to the Ombudsman's discretion, grave abuse of discretion (e.g., ignoring clear evidence) warrants judicial review.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 3(e):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act; provision regarding causing undue injury or giving unwarranted benefits through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence. *Peralta v. Desierto, G.R. No. 153152* sets out the elements of the criminal act.
*   **PD 1594 & Its Implementing Rules:** Government procurement rules, specifically regarding retention money. The decision contrasts the validity of the release with the requirements of this rule.
*   **Concept of *Custodia Legis*:** Funds subject to the writ of preliminary attachment are considered in *custodia legis*, meaning under the custody of the law.
*   **Tilendo v. Ombudsman, G.R. No. 165975** Discusses the limited power of judicial review on the Ombudsman.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Good Faith Defense:** Whether the officials' reliance on Vergara's legal opinion constitutes a valid defense to a charge of bad faith or manifest partiality, especially after notice of the writ.
*   **Timing of Vergara's Opinion:** While Vergara rendered his opinion before the writ was issued, the subsequent issuance of the writ arguably superseded his advice.
*   **Requirements for Release of Retention Money:** Whether Municipality followed all requirements under PD 1594 and its IRR for releasing retention money (e.g., surety bond or after final acceptance), and whether that statute provides a shield for the intentional violation of a court order.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court partially granted the petition, reversing the Ombudsman's decision and directing the filing of information for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 against Gonzales, Obañana, Alex Abelido, and Dominador Abelido. The Ombudsman's decision regarding Vergara was upheld.
