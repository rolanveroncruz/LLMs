## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 2009-04-SC

**Nature:** Administrative Matter involving a complaint of reckless driving against a Supreme Court Shuttle Bus Driver.

**Parties:**

*   Complainant: Atty. Wilhelmina D. Geronga, Chief of Office, Legal Division, Office of the Court Administrator (OCA)
*   Respondent: Mr. Ross C. Romero, Driver, Shuttle Bus No. 5

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   Atty. Geronga alleges reckless driving by Romero on multiple occasions, culminating in an incident on January 14, 2009, where the bus accelerated before she fully alighted, potentially causing injury.
*   Atty. Geronga supported her claims with other passengers accounts of Romero's reckless driving, and the other passengers had been nearly caught by the bus doors if not for the quick thinking of the bus coordinators.
*   Romero initially claimed Atty. Geronga alighted "unharmed" and he drove forward only after checking the mirror. However, a text message he sent to Atty. Geronga the same day contradicts this, expressing remorse and concern for injury.
*   Witness testimony from the bus coordinator Alma Cortez and Asst. Coordinator Cherrylyn Pasco corroborates that Romero started driving while Atty. Geronga was still holding onto the bus.
*   Romero admitted in a later letter that he drove without noticing Atty. Geronga was still holding the bus.

**Obligations:**

*   **Romero:** Duty of care as a professional driver to ensure the safety of passengers while boarding, during the trip, and when alighting the bus, as outlined in Administrative Circular No. 30-2004, Sec. 10(7). Obligation to exercise due diligence and avoid recklessness.
*   **Supreme Court/OAS:** Initiatory authority to discipline shuttle bus drivers.

**Liabilities:**

*   Romero found liable for gross negligence due to failure to exercise even slight care, constituting reckless disregard for passenger safety.
*   Romero's employment was terminated, effective immediately.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Substantial Evidence Standard:** The Court's reliance on the "substantial evidence" standard for administrative cases.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The Court explicitly rejects considering mitigating circumstances such as length of service or first offense, prioritizing passenger safety.
*   **Prior Case:** Romero has a pending administrative case (A.M. No. 2008-24-SC) which will likely result in a harsher penalty due to the Court's disfavor of negligence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Administrative Circular No. 30-2004:** Governs the operation of Supreme Court shuttle buses and outlines driver duties.
*   **Abueva v. Prople, G.R. No. 134387:** Defines the standard of care expected and the responsibility for foreseeable consequences.
*   **Mitsubishi Motors Philippines Corporation v. Chrysler Philippines Labor Union, G.R. No. 148738:** Defines "gross negligence."
*   **A.M. No. 2008-13-SC:** Government employees cannot be terminated without cause.

**Summary of Holding:**
Mr. Romero was found to be grossly negligent and was terminated from his position as shuttle bus driver.
