**Case Summary: Quirog and Relampagos v. Aumentado, G.R. Nos. 163443 & 163568 (November 11, 2008)**

This case consolidates two petitions challenging the CA's decision that invalidated the Civil Service Commission's (CSC) approval of Liza Quirog's permanent appointment as Provincial Government Department Head of the Office of the Bohol Provincial Agriculture (PGDH-OPA). The core issues are (1) Quirog's and former Governor Relampagos's legal standing to challenge the disapproval of the appointment, (2) whether the appointment violated CSC Resolution No. 010988 (regarding appointments after elections), and (3) whether it was a prohibited "midnight appointment."

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Appointment:** Relampagos appointed Quirog as PGDH-OPA; appointment confirmed by Sangguniang Panlalawigan.
*   **CSCROVII Disapproval:** CSC Regional Office No. VII (CSCROVII) invalidated the appointment, citing Item 3(d) of CSC Resolution No. 010988 (prohibition of mass appointments after elections).
*   **CSC Reversal:** CSC reversed CSCROVII, finding no "midnight appointment" and relaxing Item 3(a) of CSC Resolution No. 010988 (regarding PSB screening).
*   **CA Reversal:** CA reversed the CSC, holding Quirog lacked legal standing under Section 2, Rule VI of CSC Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 40, series of 1998, which seemingly limited the right to challenge a disapproved appointment to the *appointing authority*.
*   **Subsequent Action:** Aumentado later reinstated Quirog to the position of PGDH-OPA.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Obligation of appointing authority:** To adhere to CSC rules and regulations regarding appointments.
*   **Potential Liability of appointing authority:** For improper appointments that violate CSC rules, leading to potential administrative sanctions.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Misinterpretation of legal standing rules:** The CA's reliance on CSC MC No. 40, series of 1998 was deemed too restrictive. This case confirms that appointees *also* have standing to challenge appointment disapprovals, relying on *Abella, Jr. v. Civil Service Commission*.
*   **Violation of CSC Resolutions:** Failure to comply with CSC resolutions regarding appointments (e.g., timing, PSB screening) risks invalidation of appointments.
*   **"Midnight Appointment" challenges:** While local officials are not *per se* prohibited from making appointments near the end of their term, appointments intended to subvert incoming administrations or made purely for partisan purposes can still be challenged. *Aytona v. Castillo* is referenced in the ruling.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **CSC Resolution No. 010988:** Pertains to the disapproval of appointments made after elections unless certain conditions are met.
*   **CSC Memorandum Circular No. 40, series of 1998 (Rule VI, Sec. 2):** Initially interpreted as limiting the right to challenge disapproved appointments to the appointing authority; this interpretation was rejected by the Supreme Court.
*   **PD 807 & EO 292:** Served as basis of authority for the CSC to promulgate its rules and regulations.
*   **Abella, Jr. v. Civil Service Commission, G.R. No. 152574, November 17, 2004:** Key ruling establishing that *both* the appointing authority *and* the appointee have standing to challenge CSC disapproval of appointments.
*   **Mathay, Jr. v. Civil Service Commission, G.R. No. 1320214, August 9, 1999:** Distinguished; the Court clarified that the issue of appointee's standing was merely *obiter dictum* in *Mathay*.
*   **Aytona v. Castillo, G.R. No. L-19313, January 19, 1962:** Defines the concept of prohibited "midnight appointments."
*   **De Rama v. CA, G.R. No. 131136, February 28, 2001:** Regarding the prohibition on so-called "midnight appointments."

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Interpretation of Section 2, Rule VI of CSC MC No. 40, series of 1998: The word "may" was construed as *not* restricting the right to appeal solely to the appointing authority.
*   Application of CSC Resolution No. 010988: The resolution was held to have prospective application only, thus not applicable to Quirog's appointment.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA, affirming the CSC's resolutions and validating Quirog's appointment. The ruling emphasizes the appointee's right to challenge a disapproved appointment and clarifies the limitations on the prohibition against "midnight appointments" for local officials, focusing on the intent to subvert or abuse power rather than simply the timing of the appointment. The reinstatement of Quirog by Aumentado after the filing of these cases further weighs in favor of the SC's decision.
