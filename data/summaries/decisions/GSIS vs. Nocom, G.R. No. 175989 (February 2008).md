Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) vs. Mariano A. Nocom* (G.R. No. 175989, February 4, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision allowing Mariano Nocom to intervene in a case between GSIS and Bengson Commercial Buildings, Inc. (Bengson).

**Background:**

*   GSIS foreclosed on Bengson's properties due to loan defaults. Bengson sued to annul the foreclosure.
*   The RTC initially ruled in Bengson's favor, ordering the restructuring of loans, payment of rentals, and awarding costs of suit.
*   A key issue arose concerning the P31 million awarded to Bengson as costs of suit. GSIS failed to timely appeal an order relating to those costs due to its counsel's negligence. GSIS attempted, unsuccessfully, to obtain relief from this order.
*   Bengson executed on the award by garnishing and selling GSIS's San Miguel Corporation (SMC) shares.
*   Prior Supreme Court decisions (G.R. Nos. 137448 & 141454, Jan 31, 2002) reversed prior CA and RTC decisions related to these events and remanded the case to the RTC.
*   While proceedings were pending, Bengson assigned 2,406,666 SMC shares to Mariano Nocom.

**Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in allowing Nocom to intervene in the case.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *denied* the GSIS petition and *affirmed* the Court of Appeals' decision allowing Nocom to intervene.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   The Court applied Rule 19, Section 1 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, regarding who may intervene. Cites *Alfelor v. Halasan* (G.R. No. 165987, March 31, 2006, 486 SCRA 451) which outlines the conditions for valid intervention.
*   The Court focused on whether Nocom had a "legal interest in the matter in litigation" (*Perez v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 162580, January 27, 2006, 480 SCRA 411 defining such interest as direct and immediate, where the intervenor would either gain or lose by direct legal operation and effect of the judgement).
*   The Court held that Nocom *did* have such an interest because Bengson had assigned him a significant portion of the SMC shares that were subject to the execution to satisfy the costs of suit. The assignment created a direct interest in the outcome of the case.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Impact of the Intervention on Original Litigation:** The Court doesn't address how Nocom's intervention specifically affects the original litigation.
*   **Defense Against Assignment:** GSIS didn't appear to raise the issue of whether the assignment to Nocom was valid (e.g., whether Bengson had the right to assign, whether the assignment complied with any relevant restrictions or laws, or whether there was consideration). Had GSIS effectively challenged the Assignment the legal analysis may have shifted.

**Statutory and Case Law References:**

*   Rule 19, Section 1 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (Intervention)
*   *Alfelor v. Halasan*, G.R. No. 165987, March 31, 2006, 486 SCRA 451 (Conditions for Valid Intervention)
*   *Perez v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 162580, January 27, 2006, 480 SCRA 411 (Defining "Legal Interest")

**Summary for Lawyer:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision allowing intervention by Nocom, assignee of Bengson's SMC shares, finding he possessed a direct legal interest in the litigation's outcome concerning satisfaction of the costs of suit award. GSIS's main risk now lies in fully litigating the underlying case on remand, potentially facing further financial repercussions due to the costs of suit issue, with Nocom now as a party.
