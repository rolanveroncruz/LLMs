**Legal Document Summary: *Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Jerry Ocier*, G.R. No. 192023, November 21, 2018**

**Nature:** Tax assessment dispute involving deficiency capital gains tax (CGT) and documentary stamp tax (DST) arising from the respondent's transfer of shares of Best World Resources Corporation (BW Resources).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **CGT Liability:** Taxpayer is generally liable for CGT on the sale, barter, exchange, or other disposition of shares in a domestic corporation, except for transactions through the stock exchange (Section 24(C), NIRC).
*   **Definition of "Disposition":**  Broadly construed to include any act of disposing, transferring, parting with, alienation of, or giving up of property to another (Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Ed.).
*   **DST Liability:**  Arises from the exercise of a right or privilege to transfer obligations, rights, or properties incident thereto; DST covers stocks loan agreement/trust declaration.
*   **Formal Offer of Evidence:**  Evidence must be formally offered to be considered by the court (Section 34, Rule 132, Revised Rules on Evidence).
*   **CTA Duty:** Duty of court to consider all relevant and competent evidence on record.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially assessed CGT deficiency of P17,862,848.21 and DST deficiency of P71,703.76. The Supreme Court reinstated the DST assessment and remanded the CGT assessment to the CTA for recalculation.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Formal Offer:** BIR initially failed to formally offer key evidence, including the Memorandum detailing the net capital gains calculation (although SC ruled respondent's own admissions sufficient). This highlights the risk of procedural errors undermining the government's case.
*   **Nature of Transaction (Sale vs. Loan):**  Ocier argued that the transfer was a stock loan, not a sale, and thus not subject to CGT. The Supreme Court rejected this based on Ocier's admission of the transfer and the lack of substantiation for the "loan" claim.
*   **Computation of Net Capital Gains:**  Remand to CTA for proper determination of the amount of net capital gains introduces uncertainty and further litigation risk.
*   **Revenue Regulations No. 2-82:**  This regulation provides guidelines for CGT calculation. While the SC ultimately affirmed the assessment, proper application remains contentious for the CTA on remand.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 24(C) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC):** Governs capital gains from sale of shares of stock not traded in the stock exchange.
*   **Section 34, Rule 132, Revised Rules on Evidence:** Defines the necessity for a Formal Offer of Evidence.
*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. United Salvage and Towage (Phils.), Inc.*, G.R. No. 197515, July 2, 2014:**  Reinforces the necessity of a formal offer of evidence.
*   ***Vda. de OÃ±ate v. Court of Appeals***:  Sets out exceptions to the rule on formal offer of evidence, emphasizing the necessity of documents being recorded.
*    ***Black's Law Dictionary***:  6th Ed., defining "disposition" as any act of disposing, transferring to the care or possession of another, or the parting with, alienation of, or giving up of property.
*   **Revenue Regulations No. 2-82:**  Guidelines for CGT calculation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The exact terms and conditions, if any, of the alleged 'stock loan agreement/trust declaration' were not clearly defined, leading to uncertainty and challenging the legitimacy of the taxpayer's claim. The ambiguity resulted in classifying the share transfer as a disposition under Section 24(C) of the NIRC.

**Overall Outcome:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CTA En Banc's cancellation of the assessment notices, upholding the DST assessment and remanding the CGT assessment for recalculation. The decision underscores the importance of formally offering evidence and the broad interpretation of "disposition" under the NIRC, but leaves some uncertainty regarding the final amount of CGT owed.
