## Legal Document Summary: *Sari-Sari Group of Companies, Inc. vs. Piglas Kamao* (G.R. No. 164624, August 11, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which reversed the NLRC and LA rulings regarding an illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice claim.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Core Dispute:** Whether the termination of employees was a valid closure or an illegal retrenchment masked as closure. The Supreme Court (SC) found it was retrenchment.
*   **Substantial Losses:** The CA correctly ruled the company (Sari-Sari Group) failed to present *sufficient and convincing evidence* of *substantial* and *imminent losses* to justify the retrenchment, as required by *Lopez Sugar Corp. v. Federation of Free Workers* (G.R. Nos. 75700-01, August 30, 1990). The SC cited *Uichico v. National Labor Relations Commission* (G.R. No. 121434, June 2, 1997) on the need for audited financial statements as evidence. A bare allegation of irreversible loss without supporting evidence is insufficient.
*   **Theory of the Case:** The SC emphasized that the company initially presented its case before the LA as a retrenchment and cannot change its theory on appeal to a simple closure requiring no proof of losses. This is based on the principle enunciated in *Nielson & Company, Inc. v. Lepanto Mining Co.* (No. L-21601, December 28, 1968).
*   **Procedural Issues:**
    *   **Verification & Certification:** The SC held that one employee's verification and certification of non-forum shopping was sufficient for all respondents due to their common interest, representing substantial compliance with Rule 65 and Rule 46. This is supported by *Cavile v. Heirs of Clarita Cavile* (448 Phil 302 (2003)), drawing from the principle outlined in *Torres v. Specialized Packing Development Corporation* (G.R. No. 149634, July 6, 2004) and considering the nature of the action.
*   **Quitclaims:** The quitclaims executed by some employees did not bar their claims against illegal dismissal, as such releases are against public policy. Citing *Fuentes v. National Labor Relations Commission* (No. L-76835, November 24, 1988) and *Cariño v. Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration* (No. L-19808, September 29, 1966)

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The company is liable for illegal dismissal. Since reinstatement is no longer viable after many years, the company is liable to pay each respondent full backwages, computed from the date of their illegal dismissal on February 28, 1994, up to the finality of the judgment. (Masagana Concrete Products v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 106916, September 3, 1999).
*   **Requirement for Valid Retrenchment:** As outlined in *Lopez Sugar Corp.*, the company failed to meet the requirements for a valid retrenchment.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Initial Notice:** The initial notice to DOLE was ambiguous as to whether it was a retrenchment or a closure, creating grounds for argument on the applicable legal standards.
*   **Lack of Financial Records:** Failure to produce audited financial statements and other documentation substantiating financial losses was fatal to the company's defense.
*   **Changing Legal Theory:** The shift in legal theory during the appellate stage hurt the company’s credibility and legal position.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code Article 283:** Pertains to closure or cessation of operation.
*   **Rule 65 & Rule 46 of the Rules of Court:** Pertain to certiorari proceedings and the requirements of verification and certification.
*   **Lopez Sugar Corp. v. Federation of Free Workers (G.R. Nos. 75700-01, August 30, 1990):** Sets out the requisites for a valid retrenchment.
*   **Uichico v. National Labor Relations Commission (G.R. No. 121434, June 2, 1997):** Defines the type of evidence needed to prove irreversible loss
*    **Nielson & Company, Inc. v. Lepanto Mining Co (No. L-21601, December 28, 1968):** Illustrates a situation of inadmissibility of a new theory in a court of higher authority.
*   **Fuentes v. National Labor Relations Commission (No. L-76835, November 24, 1988):** Defines that a Deed of Release or Quitclaim cannot bar an employee from claiming benefits they are legally entitled to.
*   **Cariño v. Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration (No. L-19808, September 29, 1966):** Highlights that employers and employees are not on equal footing.

**Conclusion:**

The SC upheld the CA decision finding illegal dismissal. The company's failure to provide adequate proof of losses and the initial admission it was retrenching the employees, coupled with the invalid quitclaims, led to the adverse ruling. The company is liable for backwages from the date of dismissal until the finality of the judgment.
