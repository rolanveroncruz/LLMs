Here's a legal summary of *Labastida vs. Court of Appeals*, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Nonito Labastida and Constancia Labastida vs. Court of Appeals, Jose C. Deleste, Sr., Jose L. Deleste, Jr., Raul L. Deleste and Ruben L. Deleste.* G.R. No. 110174, March 19, 1998 (351 Phil. 162).

**Facts:**  Private respondents (Delestes) filed a complaint for "Recovery of Possession, Damages, with Preliminary Mandatory Injunction" in the RTC against petitioners (Labastidas), alleging the Labastidas unlawfully withheld possession of a leased portion of their land after multiple demands to vacate.  The Labastidas initially filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing the case was an unlawful detainer action that should have been filed in the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) due to the one-year period not having elapsed. The RTC denied the motion. The CA affirmed the RTC decision and ruled the petitioners were in estoppel from questioning the jurisdiction of the trial court.

**Issue:** Did the RTC have jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer case? Was the action filed within the statutory one-year period?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, declaring the RTC proceedings null and void for lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Nature of the Action:** The Supreme Court determined that the action was for *unlawful detainer* (desahucio) under Rule 70, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, based on the allegations of lease, demand to vacate, and unlawful withholding of possession.  This finding is critical, as it dictates the proper venue. The case cites *Acab v. Court of Appeals, 241 SCRA 546 (1995)*.

*   **Jurisdictional Time Bar:**  Rule 70, Section 1 dictates that an unlawful detainer action must be filed within *one year* of the unlawful withholding of possession, or the inferior court loses jurisdiction. The Court notes conflicting dates regarding when the suit was filed.

*   **Demand to Vacate:** The Court emphasized that the one-year period is reckoned from the *last* demand to vacate (*Sy Oh v. Garcia, 28 SCRA 735 (1969); Calubayan v. Pascual, 21 SCRA 146 (1967)*), accepting February 20, 1983 as the final demand date. Since the complaint was filed December 6, 1983, this placed it within the one-year period.

*   **Estoppel:** The CA incorrectly applied estoppel. While the Labastidas initially contested receiving notice, this did not automatically confer jurisdiction to the RTC. The Supreme Court reasoned that if the private respondents were to be bound by the argument that no demand had ever been served on them, then, as provided by Rule 70, §2, all the more no action can be brought against them.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70, Sections 1 & 2, Rules of Court:**  The core procedural rule governing unlawful detainer actions. The court highlights the requirements for demand and the one-year filing deadline.
*   **B.P. Blg. 25** (Rent Control Law): Was initially invoked by petitioners.
*   **P.D. No. 1517** (Urban Land Reform Act): Was also invoked by petitioners.
*   *Acab v. Court of Appeals, 241 SCRA 546 (1995)*: The Court cites *Acab* as a case wherein it was held that lease on a month-to-month basis is deemed to expire at the end of the month upon notice to vacate addressed by the lessor to the lessee.
*   *Sy Oh v. Garcia, 28 SCRA 735 (1969)* and *Calubayan v. Pascual, 21 SCRA 146 (1967)*: Established that the one-year period is counted from the date of the last demand.
*   *Racaza v. Susana Realty, Inc., 18 SCRA 1172 (1966)*: Established that any notice given only serves to negate any inference that the lessor has agreed to extend the period of the lease. Such a notice is needed only when the action is due to the lessee’s failure to pay rent or to comply with the conditions of the lease.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Delestes (Private Respondents):**  Their failure to file the unlawful detainer action in the proper court (MTC) within the prescribed timeframe resulted in the nullification of the proceedings and the loss of their initial judgment.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The primary risk revolves around misinterpreting the nature of the action and, consequently, filing in the wrong court. This highlights the importance of carefully examining the allegations in the complaint.
*   While the date of the demand and filing appear clear, the initial ambiguity caused issues during the CA review.

**Conclusion:**

*Labastida* underscores the critical importance of correctly identifying the cause of action in ejectment cases and adhering to the strict jurisdictional requirements of Rule 70, particularly the one-year filing deadline.  The case also clarifies that estoppel cannot be used to circumvent jurisdictional requirements.
