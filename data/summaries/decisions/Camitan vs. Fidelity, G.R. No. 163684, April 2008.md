**Case Summary: *Camitan v. Fidelity Investment Corporation*, G.R. No. 163684 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision annulling the RTC's order to issue a new owner's duplicate of a TCT.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioners (Camitan et al.) obtained a second owner's duplicate of TCT No. T-(12110) T-4342 from the RTC, claiming the original was lost (SLRC Case No. 1198-93-C).
*   Respondent (Fidelity) filed for annulment of judgment in the CA, alleging it purchased the property in 1967, received the owner's duplicate, possessed the land, and paid taxes. Fidelity was never titled in the land title and only filed adverse claim when the new duplicate title was issued to the Petitioners.
*   During preliminary conference, Petitioners' counsel admitted the genuineness of Fidelity's owner's duplicate.
*   Petitioners then tried to retract admission, citing honest mistake and negligence and raising discrepancies in the TCTs.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sec. 109, P.D. No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):**  Governs replacement of lost duplicate certificates of title. Requires notice under oath to the Register of Deeds and a court petition after notice and hearing.
*   **Judicial Admission (Rule 129, Sec. 4, Rules of Court):**  An admission made in the course of proceedings that dispenses with the need for proof. Can only be contradicted by showing it was made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Petitioners are bound by their counsel's judicial admission.** The CA held that honest mistake or negligence is insufficient to invalidate the admission. There was no proper showing of palpable mistake.
*   **RTC lacked jurisdiction to issue the new duplicate TCT.** The CA ruled the RTC lacked jurisdiction since the original owner's duplicate was not lost but possessed by Fidelity.  A reconstituted title is void if the original exists in the possession of another (citing *Feliciano v. Zaldivar* and others).
*   **Risk of losing property rights.** The decision effectively nullifies the duplicate title obtained by Petitioners, potentially jeopardizing their claim to the property.
*   **Limited Jurisdiction of Land Registration Court:** In a petition for the issuance of a new owner's duplicate, the court acting as a Land Registration Court has limited jurisdiction, and cannot pass upon the question of ownership. Any question involving the issue of ownership must be threshed out in a separate suit where the trial court will conduct a full-blown hearing with the parties presenting their respective evidence to prove ownership over the subject realty

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 109.**
*   **Rule 129, Section 4, Rules of Court.**
*   **Feliciano v. Zaldivar, G.R. No. 162593 (2006):** Reconstitution is void if the original TCT is not lost.
*   **Juani v. Alarcon, G.R. No. 166849 (2006):** Counsel's mistake binds the client unless it deprives them of due process.
*   **Macabalo-Bravo v. Macabalo, G.R. No. 144099 (2005)**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Arguments:**

*   **Petitioners' argument of "palpable mistake":** Petitioners tried to argue that counsel's "honest mistake and negligence" amounted to a palpable mistake, which might have permitted retraction of the admission. However, the court found the alleged discrepancies were imagined and that the counsel has opportunity to retract and failed to do so.
*   **Validity of Fidelity's ownership:** Although the court did not rule on ownership due to the limited jurisdiction of the registration court, the fact that Fidelity possessed the owner's duplicate and paid taxes since 1967 raises questions of laches and estoppel on the part of the petitioners. These are issues for a separate action on ownership.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, holding that the RTC lacked jurisdiction to issue a new owner's duplicate of the TCT because the original was in Fidelity's possession. The Petitioners were bound by their counsel's judicial admission and failed to prove any palpable mistake. Further litigation on the issue of ownership may be advisable.
