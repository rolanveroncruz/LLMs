**Case:** *People vs. Pimentel and Tujan* (G.R. No. 100210, April 1, 1998)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reviewed the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's quashal of an Information against Antonio Tujan for Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition in Furtherance of Subversion (P.D. No. 1866). The lower courts had ruled that subversion was the "main offense" and, given a prior pending subversion charge (R.A. No. 1700), double jeopardy applied. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that illegal possession of a firearm in furtherance of subversion is distinct from subversion itself.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **P.D. No. 1866, Sec. 1:** Defines and penalizes illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. Possession in furtherance of rebellion, insurrection, or subversion increases the penalty to death.
*   **R.A. No. 1700 (Anti-Subversion Law):** Penalizes membership in subversive organizations and taking up arms against the government.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** The Court held double jeopardy did *not* apply as the two charges are distinct offenses. R.A. 1700 punishes affiliation with subversive groups, while P.D. 1866 punishes illegal firearm possession, with the subversive element only aggravating the penalty. A key element is that Tujan had not been arraigned in the first subversion case. *Gaspar vs. Sandiganbayan, People vs. Obsania, People vs. Santiago, Ada vs. Virola, People vs. Pineda, People vs. Vergara, Paulin vs. Gimenez*
*   **Repeal of R.A. No. 1700 by R.A. No. 7636:** The Court, *motu proprio*, applied R.A. No. 7636 (repealing the Anti-Subversion Law) retroactively, benefiting Tujan. This required the dismissal of the subversion charge. *People vs. Simon, People vs. Moran, People vs. Tamayo, People vs. Sindiong, People vs. Jacinto*

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution:** Had the obligation to prove illegal possession of a firearm, even after R.A. No. 7636.
*   **Tujan:** Was liable for simple illegal possession of a firearm, the information being deemed amended to reflect this.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Amendment to Simple Illegal Possession:** The Court ordered the Information amended, however the court did release the accused from detention since he had already been detained longer than the new penalty prescribes.
*   **Impact of R.A. No. 8294:** The Court noted R.A. No. 8294 (further amending P.D. No. 1866) reduced the penalty for simple illegal possession.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Relevant Statutes:** P.D. No. 1866, R.A. No. 1700, R.A. No. 7636, R.A. No. 8294, Revised Rules of Court (Rules 112 and 117)
*   **Cited Cases:** Misolas vs. Panga, Enrile vs. Salazar, Tangan vs. People, Gaspar vs. Sandiganbayan, People vs. Obsania, People vs. Santiago, Ada vs. Virola, People vs. Pineda, People vs. Vergara, Paulin vs. Gimenez, People vs. Simon, People vs. Moran, People vs. Tamayo, People vs. Sindiong, People vs. Jacinto.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The primary ambiguity centered on whether illegal firearm possession "in furtherance of subversion" was a distinct offense meriting a separate prosecution given a pending subversion charge, or merely an aggravating circumstance.

**Overall, the court sided with a strict interpretation of what constitutes double jeopardy.**
