Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Mon C. Anuat vs. Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc., et al.*, G.R. No. 220898, July 23, 2018 (836 Phil. 618)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which reversed the NLRC's award of total and permanent disability benefits to the seafarer, Anuat.

**Facts:** Anuat, a seafarer, was injured during unloading operations and medically repatriated. He was examined by the company-designated physician (Dr. Cruz), who recommended further treatment. Anuat filed a claim for total and permanent disability benefits before the lapse of the 240-day extended medical treatment period. The Labor Arbiter (LA) granted total and permanent disability. The NLRC modified the LA's decision to apply the CBA and increased the disability benefits. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed, holding that Anuat prematurely filed his claim.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Disability Benefits:** The core issue is whether Anuat is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits under the Labor Code and the POEA Standard Employment Contract. The Supreme Court (SC) applied *Valenzona v. Fair Shipping Corp.*, and *Remigio v. NLRC* holding that entitlement hinges on the inability to work for more than 120 days, but this is extendable to 240 days per Sections 2 and 3(1), Rule X of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation if further medical treatment is required. The SC uses *Gomez v. Crossworld Marine Services, Inc.*, to emphasize temporary disability only becomes permanent when declared by the company physician, or after the 240-day period without a declaration.
*   **Premature Filing:** The SC, citing *C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. v. Taok*, agreed with the CA that Anuat's claim was premature as he filed it *before* the 240-day period expired, and while the company physician was still providing treatment.
*   **Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA):** Despite denying total and permanent disability, the SC found Anuat entitled to partial and permanent disability benefits under the CBA (Article 20.1.3.1) and applied the CBA over the POEA standard employment contract. The CBA provided a schedule of disability compensation.
*   **Employer's Admission:** Pacific, in its Position Paper, admitted that the company-designated physician determined that Anuat suffered a "Grade 10" and "Grade 11" disability, triggering obligations under CBA's Article 20.1.3.3. The Court cited *Alfelor v. Halasan* regarding admissions in pleadings being conclusive against the pleader.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The SC denied attorney's fees, citing *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Traverse Development Corp.*, and *Abante v. KJGS Fleet Management Manila*, finding no evidence of bad faith on Pacific's part that would compel Anuat to incur the expenses to protect his interest, since Pacific was providing continued medical care.

**Obligations:**

*   Pacific is obligated to pay Anuat US$31,257.00 based on the CBA's disability schedule for Grade 10 and Grade 11 disabilities.

**Liabilities:**

*   Pacific is liable for partial and permanent disability benefits under the CBA.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflicting Interpretations of Medical Assessments:** The initial finding of "fit for sea duty" clashes with later findings of Grade 10 and 11 disabilities, potentially raising questions about the thoroughness of pre-employment medical examinations.
*   **Reliance on CBA:** Reliance on the CBA rather than the POEA contract, when the claim was initially based on the POEA Contract.

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 442 (Labor Code of the Philippines), Art. 192.
*   Amended Rules on Employee Compensation, Sections 1, Rule XI and Sections 2 and 3(1), Rule X.
*   Rules of Court, Section 26 of Rule 130.
*   POEA Standard Employment Contract.
