**Case:** *XXX270257 vs. People of the Philippines and AAA* (G.R. No. 270257, August 12, 2024)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC conviction of XXX270257 for violation of Section 5(i) of RA 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Children Act), specifically Psychological Violence.

**Facts:**

*   XXX270257 (Petitioner) and AAA (Private Complainant) were married with three children.
*   XXX270257 abandoned AAA and their children to cohabit with another woman, CCC.
*   XXX270257 and CCC had a child whom he acknowledged.
*   XXX270257 failed to provide sufficient financial support and flaunted the new relationship, causing AAA emotional distress.
*   The RTC convicted XXX270257.
*   The CA affirmed the RTC decision.

**Issue:**

*   Whether the CA erred in finding XXX270257 guilty of violating RA 9262. Specifically, whether psychological violence was sufficiently proven.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court **denied** the petition, affirming the CA decision with modifications.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5(i) RA 9262:** Defines Psychological Violence as causing mental or emotional anguish, public ridicule, or humiliation.
*   **Section 6 RA 9262:** Prescribes the penalties for violations, including imprisonment (prision mayor), fine, and mandatory psychological counseling.

**Liabilities:**

*   Found guilty of violating Sec. 5(i) of RA 9262.
*   Sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of six months and one day of prision correccional, as minimum, to eight years and one day of prision mayor, as maximum.
*   Ordered to pay a fine of PHP 200,000.00.
*   Ordered to pay AAA moral damages in the amount of PHP 75,000.00.
*   Required to undergo mandatory psychological counseling.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Dinamling v. People*** (761 Phil. 356 (2015)):  Outlines the elements of Section 5(i) RA 9262 violation.
*   ***Labrador v. People*** (G.R. No. 260275, April 17, 2023):  States that a psychological evaluation is *not* indispensable to prove psychological violence under RA 9262. The court reiterated the ruling that no psychological evaluation is required.
*   ***Araza v. People*** (882 Phil. 905 (2020)): Victim's testimony can suffice to prove emotional anguish.

**Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The requirement of psychological evaluation is clarified; *Labrador v. People* establishes its non-indispensability.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Appeal on the sentencing.
*   Difficulty in complying with psychological counseling and reporting requirements.
*   Potential for further civil action for damages based on the same facts.

**Concurring Opinion (Caguioa, J.):**

*   Emphasizes the importance of *mens rea* (intent) in Section 5(i) violations.
*   Highlights that marital infidelity *per se* is not punished under RA 9262; rather, the act of flaunting the extramarital affair with intent to cause emotional distress constitutes the violation. Reference *Acharon v. People* clarified that the crimes penalized under Section 5(i) of Republic Act No. 9262 are mala in se.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act)
*   Section 5(i) of RA 9262 (Psychological Violence)
*   Section 6 of RA 9262 (Penalties)
