## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Torio y Paragas*

**Citation:** G.R. No. 225780, December 3, 2018 (844 Phil. 323)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) Decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) Joint Judgment convicting Jayson Torio y Paragas ("Appellant") for violations of Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession) of Article II of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Sections 5 & 11, Article II, RA 9165:** Defines and penalizes illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs (methamphetamine hydrochloride, "shabu").
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640):**  Outlines the chain of custody requirements for seized dangerous drugs, emphasizing the need for immediate inventory, photography, and witness requirements (elected public official, DOJ/National Prosecution Service/media representative).

**Facts:**

*   A buy-bust operation was conducted against the Appellant based on information from a civilian asset.  Appellant allegedly sold and possessed shabu.
*   Appellant was arrested, and two sachets of shabu were seized. They were marked by SPO1 Delos Santos as MDS1 (subject of the sale) and MDS2 (recovered from possession).
*   Inventory and photographs were taken at the police station in the presence of barangay officials, but no representatives from the DOJ/National Prosecution Service or media were present.
*   The forensic chemist confirmed the substances were shabu.
*   The RTC convicted the Appellant, and the CA affirmed.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and *acquitted* the Appellant.

**Reasoning:**

*   The prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody, specifically by failing to comply with the three-witness rule under Section 21 of RA 9165 (prior to the RA 10640 amendment applicable here).
*   The buy-bust operation occurred *before* RA 10640 amendment. Hence, DOJ and media representatives were required.
*   The arresting officers deliberately did not invite media representatives, and no justifiable reason was presented for the absence of representatives from both the DOJ and the media.
*   The Court reiterated that compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 is a matter of substantive law and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality. *People v. Macapundag* was cited.
*   Failure to justify non-compliance created reasonable doubt as to the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs.

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   **Violation of Chain of Custody Requirements:**  Non-compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 can lead to acquittals in drug cases due to reasonable doubt regarding the integrity of the evidence.
*   **Unjustified Non-Compliance:**  The arresting officers' decision to intentionally omit media representatives, without a justifiable reason, was a fatal flaw in the prosecution's case.
*   **Reliance on Presumption of Regularity:** The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty cannot prevail over the presumption of innocence, especially when there are clear procedural lapses.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Macapundag* (G.R. No. 225965, March 13, 2017):  Emphasizes the importance of strict compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165.
*   *People v. Alberto* (625 Phil. 545, 554 (2010)): Details the burden of proof to secure a conviction for illegal sale.
*   *Reyes v. Court of Appeals* (686 Phil. 137, 148 (2012)): Outlines the elements of illegal possession of drugs.
*   *People v. Viterbo* (739 Phil. 593, 601 (2014)):  Stresses the importance of establishing the identity of the drug with moral certainty.
*   *People v. Almorfe* (631 Phil. 51, 60 (2010)): Relates to the 'saving clause' and the necessity of justification for procedural lapses.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the "saving clause" in Section 21(a) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165, which allows for non-compliance with the requirements under justifiable grounds, is consistently litigated. The burden is on the prosecution to prove both the justifiable grounds and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were properly preserved.

In summary, the case highlights the importance of strict adherence to chain of custody procedures under RA 9165 in drug cases. The failure to comply with the witness requirements, absent a justifiable explanation, is a critical error that can lead to acquittal. The court prioritized the preservation of the accused's rights and due process over a conviction obtained through flawed procedures.
