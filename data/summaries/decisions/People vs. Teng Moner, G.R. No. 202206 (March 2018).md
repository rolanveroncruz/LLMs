## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Teng Moner y Adam* (G.R. No. 202206, March 5, 2018)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Accused-Appellant Teng Moner y Adam for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) – illegal sale of dangerous drugs (methylamphetamine hydrochloride or *shabu*).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, RA 9165:** Prohibits and penalizes the sale, dispensation, delivery, transportation, or distribution of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Pre-Amendment by RA 10640) and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR):** Outlines the chain of custody requirements for seized dangerous drugs, including immediate physical inventory and photography in the presence of the accused and representatives from media, DOJ, and elected public officials.

**Factual Background:**

*   Buy-bust operation conducted by Las Piñas Police Station based on information from a prior arrestee.
*   Poseur-buyer (PO2 Panopio) purchased *shabu* from Moner using marked money.
*   Moner arrested, additional *shabu* found at his residence along with co-accused.
*   Inventory and marking of evidence done at the Las Piñas Police Station, not at the scene of the arrest.

**Arguments on Appeal:**

*   Incredibility and inconsistencies in prosecution witnesses' testimonies.
*   Failure of the prosecution to present the informant.
*   Failure to comply with the mandatory provisions of Section 21 of RA 9165 regarding physical inventory, photography, and presence of required witnesses (media, DOJ, elected official).

**Court's Ruling:**

*   Affirmed the CA decision and Moner's conviction.
*   Held that the essential elements of illegal sale were proven: transaction, *corpus delicti* (illegal drug), and identification of buyer and seller.
*   Informant's testimony is not indispensable; testimony of the poseur-buyer is sufficient.
*   Minor inconsistencies in testimonies do not destroy credibility.
*   The Chain of custody requirements, substantial compliance with the requirements is sufficient provided the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Teng Moner y Adam:** Guilty of violating Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of Php500,000.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Deviation from Section 21 RA 9165 Chain of Custody Requirements:** The police did not conduct the physical inventory and photography in the presence of the accused and representatives from media, DOJ, and an elected official at the scene of the arrest. This has traditionally been a ground for acquittal in drug cases.
*  **The Dissenting Opinion notes**:
*   The Prosecution offered no explanation as to why there was non-compliance with the rule on the required witnesses.
*  The Arresting officers are compelled not only to state reasons for their non-compliance, but must in fact, also convince the Court that they exerted earnest efforts to comply with the mandated procedure, and that under the given circumstance, their actions were reasonable. Thus, for failure of the prosecution to provide justifiable grounds or show that special circumstances exist which would excuse their transgression, I respectfully submit that the integrity and evidentiary value of the items purportedly seized from the accused-appellant have been compromised.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sec. 5, Art. II:** Illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sec. 21:** Custody and Disposition of Confiscated Drugs.
*   **RA 10640:** Amendment to Section 21 of RA 9165 (not applicable as the crime occurred before the amendment).
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165:**  Details the procedures under Section 21.
*   **People v. Lafaran, 771 Phil. 311, 326-327 (2015):**  Informant's testimony not indispensable.
*   **People v. Mamalumpon, 767 Phil. 845, 855 (2015):** Minor inconsistencies do not destroy credibility.
*   **People v. Cunanan, 756 Phil. 40, 50 (2015):** Strict compliance with Section 21 is not required if the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs are preserved.
*  **People v. Usman, 753 Phil. 200 (2015):** The chain of custody is not established solely by compliance with the prescribed physical inventory and photographing of the seized drugs in the presence of the enumerated persons by law.
*   **Palo v. People, 780 Phil. 681 (2016):** Marking at the police station and lack of photograph does not compromise integrity.
*   **Saraum v. People, 779 Phil. 122, 133 (2016)** and **Mallillin v. People, 576 Phil. 576, 586-587 (2008)** Chain of Custody Ensures Authenticity of Evidence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Issues:**

*   The court relies on the "saving clause" in the IRR of RA 9165, emphasizing the preservation of integrity and evidentiary value over strict procedural compliance. However, a strong dissent argues that the prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for not fully complying with statutory requirements.
