Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document in markdown format:

**Case:** *Manuel P. Samson vs. Court of Appeals and Wilfro Luminlun* (G.R. No. 139983, March 26, 2008)

**Subject Matter:** Trademark License Revocation & Damages

**Facts:**

*   Samson owned the "OTTO" trademark for bags, shoes, sandals, slippers (Reg. No. 29840) and applied for registration for belts, bags, t-shirts, blouses, briefs, pants, jackets, jeans, and bras (App. Serial No. 47626).
*   Luminlun also applied for the "OTTO" trademark for jeans, sportswear, skirts, and socks.
*   Samson granted Luminlun a *non-transferable, non-assignable, non-exclusive* license to use the "OTTO" trademark *solely* for jeans via a written agreement dated December 29, 1983. The agreement stipulated that the authority would remain valid as long as Samson owned the trademark unless Luminlun prejudiced or discredited the OTTO trademark.
*   Samson revoked Luminlun's license in 1989, citing Luminlun's failure to pay royalties in the Revocation of Authority to Use Trademark filed at the Philippine Patent Office on March 21, 1989.
*   Luminlun sued, contesting the revocation and seeking damages for lost sales.
*   RTC ruled for Samson, finding Luminlun violated the terms of the license by using "OTTO" and "OTTO LTD." on products beyond jeans (belts, buttons, bags, skirts, shorts, pants).
*   CA reversed, holding Samson revoked the authority solely due to non-payment of royalties (which were unproven) and awarding damages to Luminlun.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **License Grant:** Non-transferable, non-assignable, non-exclusive, limited to "jeans only".
*   **Revocation Clause:**  Samson could revoke the authority if Luminlun prejudiced or discredited the "OTTO" trademark.
*   **Scope of Trademark:** Registration certificates/Application documents listed the products that the trademark was associated with and protected.
*   **Alleged Grounds for Revocation:** Initial claim was non-payment of royalties; later, unauthorized product usage.

**Obligations:**

*   **Luminlun:** Use "OTTO" trademark *only* on jeans; refrain from actions prejudicing the "OTTO" trademark; (allegedly) pay royalties.
*   **Samson:** Allow Luminlun to use the trademark as per the agreement's terms.

**Liabilities:**

*   CA awarded damages to Luminlun for lost sales due to the allegedly wrongful revocation (reversed by the Supreme Court).
*   Trial Court had awarded attorney's fees and moral damages in favor of Samson.
*   Luminlun was potentially liable for trademark infringement/unfair competition for unauthorized use.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Ambiguity in Revocation Grounds:** The initial justification (non-payment of royalties) was factually weak, while the later-asserted ground (unauthorized product usage) was the basis for the SC reversal. This raises issues of reliance and potential estoppel arguments.
*   **Scope of "Prejudice" or "Discredit":** The contract language is somewhat vague.  The SC determined that Luminlun's actions met this threshold. However, this could be a point of contention depending on the specifics of other licensing agreements.
*   **Valuable Consideration:** In the Authority to Use Trademark, it stated, “That for valuable consideration, I hereby grant…” The document does not disclose what that valuable consideration is.

**Statutory References:**

*   The case implicitly involves the Trademark Law (likely the law in effect in the 1980s). A lawyer would need to analyze the relevant provisions regarding licensing, infringement, and revocation remedies based on Philippine law.
*   Intellectual Property Code (Republic Act No. 8293)

**Case Law Relevance:**

*   The case turns on interpretation of the licensing agreement and the justification for its revocation. Relevant case law on contract interpretation, trademark rights, and the limitations on licenses is crucial. The Court used the agreement to determine whether Samson was justified in revoking Luminlun's authority to use the "OTTO" trademark.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and reinstated the trial court's decision. It held that Samson *was* justified in revoking the license because Luminlun violated the terms by using the "OTTO" trademark on unauthorized products, which was a valid ground for revocation per the agreement's terms. The initial focus on unpaid royalties did not negate the validity of the other, sufficient ground.
