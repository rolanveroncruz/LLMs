**Case Summary: *Abay, Jr. v. People*, G.R. No. 165896 (Sept. 19, 2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC conviction of petitioners for Highway Robbery/Brigandage under Presidential Decree No. 532 (Anti-Piracy and Anti-Highway Robbery Law of 1974).

**Facts:** Petitioners Rustico Abay, Jr. and Reynaldo Darilag were convicted of highway robbery, along with several co-accused, based on an Information alleging that they formed a band, armed with handguns and bladed weapons, robbed passengers of a Kapalaran Bus, and shot a passenger.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **P.D. No. 532, Section 2(e):** Defines Highway Robbery/Brigandage as seizing a person for ransom or extortion, or taking another's property through violence, intimidation, force, or unlawful means on a Philippine highway.

**Liabilities:**

*   The RTC sentenced petitioners to an indeterminate sentence and ordered them to indemnify the victims for their losses.
*   The CA affirmed the RTC decision on petitioners Abay Jr. and Darilag.

**Case Law:**

*   **People v. Puno, G.R. No. 97471 (Feb. 17, 1993):** Clarifies that brigandage requires indiscriminate robbery on highways, whereas a planned robbery against a specific victim constitutes simple robbery, or robbery in band if the requirements are met.

**Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities/Issues:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The petitioners challenged the credibility of Ramoncito Aban, an accomplice who pleaded guilty to simple robbery, arguing that his testimony was inconsistent and unreliable. They claimed that the crime occurred on February 22, 1994, instead of February 17, 1994, as alleged.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** Petitioners challenged the admissibility of Aban's extrajudicial confession. The court ruled that it was admissible because it was affirmed in open court.
*   **Defense of Alibi:** The petitioners raised the defense of alibi, claiming they were incarcerated at the time of the robbery. However, this defense was rejected due to the positive identification of petitioners by witnesses and the proximity of the prison to the crime scene, making it plausible for them to be present.
*   **Inconsistency of Evidence:** Petitioners alleged that a similar case was filed against them, but they were acquitted by the court. However, there was no evidence to show the amount and quality of evidence in both cases were similar.
*   **Lack of Physical Evidence:** The Petitioners questioned the lack of physical evidence linking them to the crime. However, the court ruled that it was not necessary because the testimonies of witnesses provided sufficient credible evidence.

**Potential Risks/Considerations:**

*   **Affirmance of Conviction:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, upholding the petitioners' conviction.
*   **Reliance on Accomplice Testimony:** The conviction relies heavily on the testimony of an accomplice. Defense counsel should have challenged the sufficiency of corroborating evidence to determine if accomplice testimony was sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Application of PD 532:** The case reinforces the broad application of PD 532 to highway robberies, even when directed at a specific vehicle, if the underlying intent is indiscriminate robbery.

**Conclusion:**

The *Abay* case highlights the importance of credible eyewitness testimony, the admissibility of affirmed extrajudicial confessions, and the limitations of the alibi defense. The Supreme Court's decision underscores the State's commitment to prosecuting highway robbery/brigandage under PD 532.
