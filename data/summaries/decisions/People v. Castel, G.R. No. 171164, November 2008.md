## Legal Document Summary: People v. Castel, G.R. No. 171164

**Type:** Criminal Case (Rape)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines (affirming CA conviction)

**Parties:** People of the Philippines (Plaintiff-Appellee) vs. Nasario Castel (Accused-Appellant)

**Key Issue:** Whether the accused, Nasario Castel, is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of multiple counts of rape against his daughter, AAA.

**Ruling:**  Affirmed conviction of the accused for six (6) counts of qualified rape.  Sentence modified from death to *reclusion perpetua* due to Republic Act No. 9346 (repealing the death penalty).  Ordered to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Facts:** Nasario Castel convicted of raping his daughter, AAA, on multiple occasions between December 1996 and November 1997. The RTC convicted Castel in six (6) out of the seven (7) informations of rape.
*   **Elements of Rape (Art. 335, RPC):** The Court reiterates the elements of rape: (1) sexual congress, (2) with a woman, and (3) by force and without consent. Prosecution established these elements beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Credibility of Complainant:**  The Court affirmed the trial court's assessment of the complainant's (AAA) credibility. Consistent and straightforward testimony, even under cross-examination, deemed credible. The court highlighted the trial court's advantage in observing demeanor of witnesses, with reference to cases such as *People v. Dy*.
*   **Positive Identification:** AAA positively identified Castel as the perpetrator. Positive identification prevails over the accused's denial and alibi, citing *People v. Abes*.
*   **Force and Intimidation:**  While some instances involved physical force (slapping, covering mouth), the Court emphasizes that in incestuous rape, the "overpowering moral influence" of the father is sufficient, citing *People v. Orillosa* and *People v. Chua*.  Actual force need not be proven.
*   **Desistance Letter(s):** Letters purportedly written by AAA, GGG, and FFF withdrawing the accusations were deemed inadmissible as hearsay and were never presented during the trial. Also, no concrete proof that the letters were written freely and voluntarily.
*   **Prosecution De Oficio:**  The Court notes that Republic Act No. 8353 reclassified rape as a crime against persons, allowing prosecution *de oficio*.  BBB's (grandmother) assistance in filing the complaint was deemed sufficient, especially since the mother (FFF) was not supportive.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Articles 266-A, 266-B, 335, 344.
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 7659:** Amended Article 335 of the RPC regarding the penalty for rape.
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 8353:** Amended RPC, reclassifying rape as a crime against persons; specifically cited regarding incestuous rape.
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 9346:** Repealed the death penalty.
*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 7, 2004, 433 SCRA 640:** Case cited pertaining to the procedural aspects of the case and the transfer of the case to the CA for action and disposition.
*   **People v. Dy, 425 Phil. 608, 637 (2002):** Case cited that highlights the court's assessment of credibility of witnesses.
*   **People v. Abes, 465 Phil. 165, 185 (2004):** Case cited pertaining to the credibility and testimony of witnesses.
*   **People v. Orillosa, G.R. Nos. 148716-18, July 7, 2004, 433 SCRA 689, 699:** Case cited pertaining to incestuous rape of a minor.
*   **People v. Chua, [102]:** Case cited explaining how the perpetrator takes full advantage of the blood relationship.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Desistance Letters:** While deemed inadmissible, the fact that these letters exist could be argued as mitigating factors in a petition for executive clemency (which the accused seemingly acknowledges by securing a medical abstract).
*   **Lack of Information in Crim. Case No. 1547-M-98:** There's mention that the prosecutor failed to elicit information related to the rape in the case. This suggests a potential weakness in the prosecution's evidence that was not fully explored.
* **Health Status:** Accused's suffering of multiple illnesses which may serve as ground for seeking for parole after serving his sentence.
