## Legal Document Summary: Iran v. NLRC, G.R. No. 121927

**Case Summary:** This case concerns a dispute between Antonio Iran (petitioner/employer) and his former driver/salesmen and truck helpers (respondents/employees) regarding alleged illegal dismissal, underpayment of wages, and other monetary claims. The Supreme Court (SC) reviewed the NLRC's decision, which affirmed the Labor Arbiter's (LA) findings.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Minimum Wage Compliance:** The central issue is whether commissions earned by employees can be included in the calculation of wages to meet minimum wage requirements. The SC held that **commissions *are* part of wages** under Article 97(f) of the Labor Code and must be considered when determining compliance with minimum wage laws.
*   **13th Month Pay:** P.D. No. 851 mandates 13th-month pay. Employer is obligated to pay it's employee their 13th month pay, but the voucher that cover only a particular year.
*   **Procedural Due Process in Termination:** The SC affirmed that the employer failed to comply with procedural due process requirements during the termination of the employees. Two written notices are required: (1) apprising the employee of the grounds for dismissal and (2) informing the employee of the decision to dismiss.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Wage Differential Liability:** Due to the erroneous exclusion of commissions from wage calculations, the employer potentially faces liability for wage deficiencies if the calculated wage (including commissions) falls below the statutory minimum.
*   **Liability for Procedural Defects in Dismissal:** The employer is liable for failing to provide proper notice of the intention to dismiss, resulting in an award of nominal damages of P5,000.00 per employee.
*   **Potential 13th Month Pay:** The petitioner may have a financial obligation because the vouchers that were presented as evidence of payment were not for every year that payment was required.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Recomputation of Wage Differentials:** The case is remanded to the Labor Arbiter for recomputation of wage deficiencies, exposing the employer to potential financial liability based on the outcome.
*   **Continued Litigation:** The case is remanded, increasing legal costs and uncertainty.
*   **Damage to Reputation:** Adverse publicity surrounding the labor dispute could harm the employer's reputation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 97(f) of the Labor Code:** Defines "wage" to include commissions.
*   **P.D. No. 851:** Mandates 13th month pay.
*   **Philippine Duplicator’s, Inc. vs. NLRC, 227 SCRA 747 (1993):** Clarifies that commissions are part of wages/salary.
*   **Philippine Agricultural Commercial and Industrial Workers Union vs. NLRC, 247 SCRA 256 (1995):** Drivers paid purely on commission are entitled to the basic minimum pay if their commissions are less than that for an eight-hour work day.
*   **Malaya Shipping vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 121698, March 26, 1998:**  Established the two-notice requirement for terminating employees.
*   **Section 2 of Book V, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code:** In cases of abandonment of work, notice should be sent to the worker’s last known address.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credit for 13th Month Pay Vouchers:** The court acknowledges that vouchers presented can be counted but for a specific year only. The ambiguity here lies in the fact that the voucher for a specific year cannot be counted for the following years.
*   **Just Cause for Termination:** While the NLRC and LA initially upheld the "just cause" for termination (alleged misappropriation), the SC focuses on the lack of procedural due process.  The underlying issue of the alleged irregularities remains somewhat unresolved, although the procedural deficiencies are the primary concern.
