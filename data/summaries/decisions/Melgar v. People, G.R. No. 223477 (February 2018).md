## Legal Document Summary: *Celso M.F.L. Melgar v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 223477)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC conviction of petitioner for violating Section 5(e) of RA 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004).

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA correctly upheld Melgar's conviction for economic abuse under RA 9262, specifically Section 5(e), for failure to provide financial support to his illegitimate child.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court DENIED the petition, affirming Melgar's conviction for violation of Section 5(e) of RA 9262. The Court affirmed that the deprivation or denial of financial support to a child constitutes an act of violence under the law, as defined as "Economic Abuse."

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 5(e) RA 9262:** Criminalizes depriving a woman or her children of financial support legally due, or deliberately providing insufficient financial support.
*   **Section 3(D) RA 9262:** Defines economic abuse to include depriving support of a common child, legitimate or not.
*   **Obligation of Parents:** Based on the Family Code, to provide support to children (legitimate and illegitimate). Articles 194, 195, and 203.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Imprisonment for an indeterminate period of six (6) months of *arresto mayor* to four (4) years and two (2) months of *prision correccional*.
*   **Financial Liability:** Fine of P300,000.00.
*   **Remedial Measures:** Mandatory psychological counselling or psychiatric treatment with reporting obligation to the trial court.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9262 (Anti-VAWC Act):** Basis for the charges and conviction.
*   **Family Code Articles 194, 195, & 203:** Defines parental obligation for support.
*   **Act No. 4103 (Indeterminate Sentence Law):** Used to determine the correct indeterminate sentence based on special penal law (RA 9262) adopting penalties under Revised Penal Code.
*   **People v. Simon (G.R. No. 93028, July 29, 1994, 239 SCRA 555)** Used to differentiate from special laws.
*   **Quimvel v. People (G.R. No. 214497, April 18, 2017):** Application of ISL to special penal laws adopting RPC penalties.
*   **Del Socorro v. Van Wilsem, 749 Phil. 823, 839 (2014):** Denial of support is a continuing offense.
*   **Dinamling v. People, 761 Phil. 356, 376 (2015):** Discussion on psychological violence as element of Section 5(i).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Information Inconsistency:** The Information alluded to Section 5(i) (psychological violence), while the conviction was under Section 5(e). The Court invoked the variance doctrine to justify the conviction, which could be argued as a denial of due process.
*   **Lack of Evidence of Psychological Anguish:** While the Information mentioned "mental or emotional anguish," the Court noted a lack of specific evidence proving such anguish, meaning a conviction under Section 5(i) was not possible.
*   **Continuing Offense:** The Court reinforced that denial of support is a continuing offense. The implications are that the respondent could continue to accrue criminal and civil liability as the obligation for support continues.
*   **Compromise Agreement:** The initial compromise agreement and its subsequent setting aside are a potential area for appeal, arguing that the terms were unfair or improperly rescinded.
*   **Waiver of Evidence:** The petitioner waived the right to present evidence due to repeated failure to appear. This could be grounds for appeal if the petitioner can show a valid reason for the absences.
