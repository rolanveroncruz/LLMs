Okay, here's a summary of the provided *Republic of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals and Loh Khuan Fatt* case, focusing on the relevant legal points for a lawyer:

**Case Summary: Republic vs. CA and Loh Khuan Fatt, G.R. No. 109564 (July 22, 1998)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's grant of Loh Khuan Fatt's petition for naturalization.

**Key Issue:** Whether Loh Kuan Fatt met the statutory requirements for naturalization under the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding the grant of naturalization.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Residency Requirement:** The Republic argued Loh failed to accurately state all prior residences in his petition, citing *Republic vs. Barcelona* and related cases. The Court held that the omission was inadvertent and cured by the inclusion of police clearances from all residences and testimony during the hearing.

*   **Character Witness Sufficiency:** The Republic argued that the character witnesses did not know Loh for the *entire* required period of residence. The Court ruled that knowing the applicant for a substantial period is sufficient, particularly given Loh's marriage to a Filipino citizen, which reduces the required residency period from ten to five years under Section 3 of the Revised Naturalization Law.

*   **Witness Bias:** The Republic challenged the credibility of one witness because she was Loh's sister-in-law. The Court rejected this, stating that interest in the outcome is not a ground for disqualification under the Rules of Court.

*   **Income Disclosure and Good Moral Character:** The Republic alleged that Loh misrepresented his income to evade taxes, thus lacking good moral character. The Court found no evidence of untrustworthy motives and accepted the discrepancy as a "rough estimate." Citing *Republic vs. Li Yao* and *Lim Eng Yu vs. Republic*.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473), specifically:
    *   Section 2 (general requirements for naturalization)
    *   Section 3 (reduced residency requirement for those married to Filipino citizens)

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The case highlights the importance of meticulous adherence to the requirements of the Revised Naturalization Law.
*   While the Court took a lenient view on the residency and income disclosure issues in this specific case, future applicants should be aware that even seemingly minor inaccuracies could be grounds for denial.

**Overall Assessment:**

The case solidifies the principle that substantial compliance with the naturalization law is sufficient, especially considering the reduced residency requirement for those married to Filipino citizens. The Court emphasized a reasonable interpretation of the law, avoiding overly technical or restrictive readings.
