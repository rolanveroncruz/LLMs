## Legal Document Summary: CIR vs. CA, CTA, & YMCA (G.R. No. 124043)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari challenging CA Resolutions that affirmed the CTA's decision to grant YMCA tax exemption on rental income.

**Key Issue:** Is rental income from real property owned by YMCA, a non-stock, non-profit welfare, educational, and charitable corporation, subject to income tax under the NIRC and the Constitution?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) GRANTED the petition, holding that YMCA's rental income is taxable under the NIRC.  The CA Resolutions were reversed, reinstating its original decision that the rental income is subject to income tax.

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **NIRC (National Internal Revenue Code), Section 27 (now Section 26):** Exempts certain organizations from income tax "in respect to income received by them as such." However, the last paragraph states that income "from any of their properties, real or personal, or from any of their activities conducted for profit" is taxable.
    *   **SC Interpretation:** The SC applies a strict interpretation against tax exemptions. The last paragraph of Section 27 unequivocally subjects rental income from the YMCA's property to tax, regardless of its use (profit or non-profit). Verba legis non est recedendum (from the words of the law, there must be no departure). The phrase "activities conducted for profit" does not qualify the word "properties," thus, making income from the property taxable.
*   **1987 Constitution, Article VI, Section 28, par. 3:** Provides exemptions from taxation for "charitable institutions, churches... and all lands, buildings, and improvements actually, directly, and exclusively used for religious, charitable, or educational purposes."
    *   **SC Interpretation:** This provision only provides exemption from property taxes, not income tax. The intent of the framers, based on constitutional debates, confirms this.
*   **1987 Constitution, Article XIV, Section 4, par. 3:** Exempts "all revenues and assets of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes... from taxes and duties."
    *   **SC Interpretation:** YMCA did not prove it qualifies as an "educational institution" under the Education Act of 1982 (schools, formal education) or that the rental income was used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **YMCA:** Liable for income tax on rental income derived from its real property.
*   **CIR:** Responsible for assessing and collecting the income tax.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in "conducted for profit":** The YMCA argued the last paragraph of Section 27 should be interpreted to mean only income from activities "conducted for profit" is taxable. The SC rejected this, applying the plain meaning rule to subject income from property (rent) to tax, regardless of purpose.
*   **YMCA's reliance on Constitutional Provisions:**  YMCA's claim that Article VI, Section 28, paragraph 3 of the 1987 Constitution exempts "charitable institutions" from income tax from any source was rejected, citing the intent of the framers of the Constitution. The Court also clarified that to be exempt under Article XIV, Section 4, par. 3, the YMCA must first prove it is an educational institution, and that the income is actually, directly, and exclusively used for educational purposes, which it did not do.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Principle of Strict Interpretation Against Tax Exemptions:** The SC emphasizes the doctrine of strict interpretation when construing tax exemptions, placing the burden on the claimant to demonstrate clear entitlement. *Davao Gulf Lumber Corporation v. CIR*
*   **Distinction Between Question of Fact and Law:** The CA did not alter any fact or evidence as found by the CTA, but applied the law to the facts. *Ramos et al. v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of the P.I. et al.*
*    **Cases Cited by YMCA**: The SC distinguished the prior cases of *YMCA of Manila v. Collector of Internal Revenue*, *Abra Valley College, Inc. v. Aquino* and *Hospital de San Juan de Dios, Inc. v. Pasay City* because they concerned exemption from *property tax*, not income tax.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses (argued but rejected):**
* the wording of the NIRC Sec. 27, last paragraph.

**Concise Legal Assessment:**

This case reinforces the principle that tax exemptions are to be construed strictly against the claimant.  Despite YMCA's charitable purpose, the plain language of the NIRC dictates that rental income is taxable. The SC's interpretation of the constitutional provisions further limits the scope of tax exemptions for charitable and educational institutions. A potential risk for similar organizations is reliance on constitutional arguments without sufficient evidence and without adhering to a strict interpretation of the law. This decision highlights the importance of careful structuring of revenue streams to potentially avail of available exemptions.
