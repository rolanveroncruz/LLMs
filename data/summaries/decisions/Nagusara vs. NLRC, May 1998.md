**Case Summary: *Francisco U. Nagusara, et al. v. NLRC, et al.* (G.R. Nos. 117936-37, May 20, 1998)**

**Nature:** Petition to annul the NLRC resolution dismissing the illegal dismissal complaint of petitioners Nagusara, Pamilara, and Cruz against respondents Dy and Amurao.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Petitioners allege illegal dismissal from Dynasty Steel Works owned by Dy. Dy contends petitioners were employees of Amurao, a subcontractor.
*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The central issue is whether an employer-employee relationship existed between petitioners and Dy.
*   **Subcontracting:** Dy claims Amurao was a legitimate job contractor per Articles 106, 107 & 109 of the Labor Code, thus absolving Dy of direct employer responsibility.
*   **Project Employees vs. Regular Employees:** Amurao contends petitioners were merely project employees for a specific project.
*   **Reliefs:**  Petitioners sought reinstatement, backwages, and other monetary claims.

**Decision & Rationale:**

The Supreme Court SET ASIDE the NLRC decision and held:

1.  **Employer-Employee Relationship Existed with Dy:** SSS Premium Certifications and Dynasty's payroll records prove that Petitioners were employees of respondent Dy, establishing an employer-employee relationship, despite the alleged subcontract.
2.  **Sham Subcontracting:** The alleged subcontract between Dy and Amurao was deemed a subterfuge. Amurao failed to meet the requirements of a legitimate job contractor as defined in *Tiu v. NLRC, 254 SCRA 1 (1996)*, specifically failing to show independent business operations and substantial capital investment.
3.  **Regular Employees:** Petitioners were deemed regular employees under Article 280 of the Labor Code because their activities (carpentry) were necessary/desirable in Dy's business, and they were not informed of any specific project at time of engagement. This distinguishes it from a project-based employment (*ALU-TUCP v. NLRC, 234 SCRA 678 (1994)* and *J & D.O. Aguilar Corp. v. NLRC, 269 SCRA 596 (1997)*).
4.  **Illegal Dismissal Established:**  Dy failed to meet burden of proof that the dismissal was for just cause (*Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 99030, July 31, 1997; JGB and Associates, Inc. v. NLRC, 254 SCRA 457 (1996)*).  Self-serving allegations of drinking on the premises were insufficient without corroborating evidence.

**Reliefs Granted:**

*   **Separation Pay:** Due to the closure of Dynasty Steel Works in May 1985 (as documented in the respondent's comment), reinstatement was not feasible.
*   **Backwages:**  From the date of illegal dismissal until the date of Dynasty's closure in May 1985 (*Pizza Inn/Consolidated Foods Corp. v. NLRC, 162 SCRA 773 (1988)*).
*   **Other Money Claims Denied:** Overtime, holiday pay, and premium pay were dismissed for lack of sufficient evidence based on the Labor Arbiter's findings.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Closure Date:**  The exact closure date of Dynasty Steel Works is based on Dy's comment, requiring verification as it directly impacts the backwages calculation.
*   **Calculation of Separation Pay and Backwages:** Requires precise determination based on petitioners' last salaries and service duration.
*   **Liability of Dy:** This case focuses primarily on the liability of Dy as the principal employer; however, potential liabilities related to Amurao's role as a "labor-only contractor" should be explored further, particularly concerning potential joint and several liability with Dy for backwages and separation pay.

**Conclusion:**

This case hinges on demonstrating the true nature of the employment relationship and the validity of the subcontracting arrangement. The Supreme Court applied relevant Labor Code provisions and jurisprudence to find illegal dismissal.  Key to the decision was the failure to prove Amurao was a legitimate independent contractor. The limited relief (separation pay instead of reinstatement) due to business closure needs to be carefully calculated and documented.
