## Legal Document Summary: *Rural Bank of Sta. Barbara v. Manila Mission of the Church* (G.R. No. 130223)

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Rural Bank of Sta. Barbara (Pangasinan), Inc. (Attaching Creditor)
*   **Respondent:** The Manila Mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Inc. (Purchaser/Vendee)

**Key Issue:** Priority dispute between a prior unregistered sale of land and a subsequent registered attachment of the same land.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Soliven owned a parcel of land.
*   May 18, 1992: Spouses Soliven sold the land to Manila Mission (unregistered sale).
*   April 15, 1993: Rural Bank filed a complaint against Spouses Soliven for a sum of money and sought a writ of preliminary attachment (Civil Case No. D-10583).
*   May 7, 1993: RTC issued a writ of preliminary attachment.
*   May 21, 1993: Writ of Attachment issued.
*   May 24, 1993: Attachment annotated on TCT in the name of Spouses Soliven.
*   April 28, 1994: TCT of spouses Soliven cancelled and a new TCT issued in favor of Manila Mission, annotation of attachment carried over.
*   Manila Mission filed a Motion to Release Property from Attachment in Civil Case No. D-10583.
*   RTC granted the Motion, discharging the property from attachment.
*   Rural Bank appealed, eventually reaching the Supreme Court.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *granted* the Petition for Review, reversing the Court of Appeals and RTC. The Court held that the duly registered levy on attachment by the Rural Bank takes preference over the prior but then unregistered sale of the Manila Mission.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

1.  **Propriety of Motion to Release Attachment:**
    *   Rural Bank argued Manila Mission's remedy should have been a third-party claim with the Sheriff (Rule 57, Section 14, Rules of Court).
    *   Manila Mission argued filing was done on the advice of the sheriff
    *   The Court of Appeals construed the Motion as an invocation of the RTC's power of control over its officers. The Supreme Court agreed, deeming it a continuation of the third-party claim or, alternatively, a Motion for Intervention (Rule 19, Rules of Court).
    *   Court emphasized technicalities should not take precedence over substantive rights.
2.  **Unregistered Sale vs. Registered Attachment:**
    *   General rule: Duly registered levy on attachment takes preference over a prior unregistered sale (*Valdevieso v. Damalerio*, 492 Phil. 51 (2005)).
    *   Manila Mission argued there was a "special circumstance" of constructive registration due to building a church on the property.
    *   **Court's Analysis:**
        *   Affirmed the general rule; the bank's duly registered lien trumps the prior unregistered sale.
        *   The Court relied on *Ruiz, Sr. v. Court of Appeals*, 414 Phil. 311 (2001) for the concept of constructive registration. Acknowledged that knowledge of an unregistered sale is equivalent to registration *but* the Bank lacked actual or constructive knowledge of the sale and construction to be affected.
        *   Distinguished *Ruiz* because the attaching party in that case was related to the vendor, and thus, likely had knowledge of the prior sale. No such relationship existed here.
        *   Mere existence of the church construction was deemed insufficient to impute knowledge of the sale to the Rural Bank.
3.  **Available Remedies for Respondent**
    *   Can file a counter-bond pursuant to Section 12, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court in order to discharge the attachment
    *   If property ends up being subjected to execution, respondent can redeem the property and seek reimbursement from the spouses Soliven.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Factual Dispute Regarding Knowledge:** The central point of contention hinges on whether the Rural Bank had knowledge of the prior sale. The Court found insufficient evidence to establish this.
*   **Constructive Notice Doctrine:** Application of the constructive notice doctrine is always fact-dependent. Arguably, building a church could be considered substantial enough to trigger a duty of inquiry by the attaching creditor. Future litigation could revisit this issue if more compelling evidence arises.
*   **Spouses Soliven Liability:** The decision doesn't directly address Spouses Soliven's liability to either party, but their involvement in the prior sale creates potential claims against them, particularly if the Manila Mission sustains losses as a result of the attachment.
*   **Rule 57, Sec 14 Application**
    *   The Court ruled that the Motion to Discharge Attachment could be deemed as Motion for Intervention per Rule 19, but the appropriateness may be contested.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 45, Rules of Court (Petition for Review on Certiorari)
*   Rule 57, Rules of Court (Preliminary Attachment), especially Sections 12 (Discharge of Attachment upon giving Counter-Bond) and 14 (Proceedings where Property claimed by Third Person)
*   Rule 19, Rules of Court (Intervention)

**Case Law:**

*   *Valdevieso v. Damalerio*, 492 Phil. 51 (2005) - Reiterated the rule that a registered attachment takes precedence over a prior unregistered sale.
*   *Ruiz, Sr. v. Court of Appeals*, 414 Phil. 311 (2001) - Established the exception that knowledge of a prior unregistered interest is equivalent to registration.
*   *Coronel v. Desierto, 448 Phil. 894, 902-903 (2003).*
