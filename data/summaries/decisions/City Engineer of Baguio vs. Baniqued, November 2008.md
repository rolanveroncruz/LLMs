## Legal Document Summary: *City Engineer of Baguio vs. Baniqued* (G.R. No. 150270)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming the Court of Appeals' decision to set aside the RTC's dismissal of a complaint for prohibition with TRO/injunction filed against the City Engineer and Mayor of Baguio City.

**Key Issue:** Whether the City Mayor's issuance of a Notice of Demolition constitutes a quasi-judicial function, thereby making the remedy of prohibition appropriate.

**Facts:**  Rolando Baniqued filed a complaint for prohibition to prevent the demolition of his house in Baguio City, arguing lack of due process. The demolition was initiated by a Notice of Demolition issued by the City Mayor based on a complaint from a third party and a City Engineer's Office finding of construction without a building permit in violation of PD 1096 and RA 7279.  Baniqued claimed he was not given notice or an opportunity to be heard. The RTC dismissed the complaint, finding the Mayor's action executive and Baniqued's failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The CA reversed, holding the Mayor exercised quasi-judicial functions and Baniqued stated a cause of action.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Notice of Demolition:** Issued by the City Mayor based on alleged violations of PD 1096 (National Building Code) and RA 7279 (Urban Development and Housing Act).
*   **Right to Due Process:**  Central argument is the violation of Baniqued's right to due process, specifically the lack of notice and opportunity to be heard before the demolition notice was issued.
*   **Prohibition as a Remedy:** The core legal question is whether a writ of prohibition is the proper remedy to challenge the Mayor's action.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **City Officials' Potential Liability:**  If the demolition proceeds without due process, the city officials could face liability for violating Baniqued's constitutional rights.
*   **Delay in Enforcement:** The litigation delays the city's ability to enforce building codes and address illegal construction.
*   **Impact on other Cases:** The case sets a precedent regarding the scope of a mayor's quasi-judicial powers and the availability of prohibition as a remedy in similar situations.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **PD 1096 (National Building Code):** Alleged violation regarding building permits.  Relevant sections pertain to permit requirements and demolition of dangerous or ruinous structures. Section 213 is noted for outlining criminal prosecution as a remedy, instead of demolition, for violations of the code.
*   **RA 7279 (Urban Development and Housing Act):** Potential violation related to illegal structures. Section 28 requires adequate relocation before demolition, and Section 44 outlines penalties for squatting.
*   **Civil Code Article 536:** Baniqued argued this provision requires a court action before demolition and eviction.  The applicability of this provision is contentious.
*   **Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 65, Section 2 (Prohibition):** Defines the requirements for a petition for prohibition.
*   **_Reyes v. Romero_, G.R. No. L-14917:** Cited by Petitioners, the Supreme Court distinguishes this case by pointing out that it involved a different factual background.
*   **_Paat v. Court of Appeals_, G.R. No. 111107:** The Supreme Court cites this case regarding the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Distinction between Notice and Order of Demolition:** The city argued the notice was not a final order, while the court saw the distinction as immaterial.
*   **Mayor's Quasi-Judicial Role:** The key contentious issue is whether the Mayor was exercising a quasi-judicial function when issuing the notice. The Supreme Court found that while executing executive functions, the office of the mayor has the authority to hear issues involving property rights, as such, the mayor executes quasi-judicial functions.
*   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** The Supreme Court determined that the exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine applied, excusing Baniqued's failure to pursue administrative remedies, because of the urgent need for intervention.
*   **Article 536 of the Civil Code:** There is contention in whether this article applies.

**Potential Risks for Petitioners (City Engineer and Mayor):**

*   The case could be remanded to the lower court and an injunction could be granted, permanently preventing the demolition.
*   The case could encourage similar suits against the city's demolition efforts if proper due process isn't followed.
*   They could face further legal challenges if the court rules the City Mayor was acting beyond their jurisdiction.
