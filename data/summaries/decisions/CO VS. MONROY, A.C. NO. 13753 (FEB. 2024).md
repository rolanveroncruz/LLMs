## Legal Document Summary: *Co v. Monroy* (A.C. No. 13753)

**Nature:** Disbarment proceeding against Atty. Jorge P. Monroy.

**Holding:** Atty. Monroy is disbarred for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), specifically Canon II, Sections 1, 2, and 28, and fined PHP 20,000 for disobedience to the IBP.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Canon II, Sections 1, 2, and 28 of CPRA:** Requires lawyers to act with propriety, maintain the appearance of propriety, observe honesty, respect and courtesy, and uphold the dignity of the legal profession. Further requires dignified conduct and respect for government agencies, and prohibits use of public position to advance private interests.
*   **Obligation of Lawyers in Government Service:** Cannot use their public position for private gain or allow it to interfere with public duties.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Disbarment:** The most severe penalty, permanently revoking Atty. Monroy's license to practice law.
*   **Fine of PHP 20,000:** For failure to comply with IBP-CBD orders (failure to file an answer, mandatory conference brief, appear at the mandatory conference, and submit a position paper).

**Case Facts and Rationale:**

Atty. Monroy, while Director III at the Bureau of Customs (BOC), offered to sell a confiscated Toyota Land Cruiser to the complainant, Julieta Co, for PHP 1.4 million. He misrepresented the legality of the transaction and used his position to convince Julieta to pay. After receiving the money, he failed to deliver the vehicle and claimed the money was stolen.

**Rationale for Disbarment:** The Court found that Atty. Monroy, by leveraging his government position and engaging in a scheme to defraud Julieta, violated the CPRA. He demonstrated a lack of honesty, integrity, and respect for the law and his public duties, rendering him unfit to continue practicing law. His actions were characterized by the Sandiganbayan as highly irregular.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **CPRA (A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC):** The basis for the disbarment, specifically Canon II, Sections 1, 2, and 28.
*   **Rule 138, Section 27 of the Rules of Court:** Initially considered for disbarment based on conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude but ultimately not relied upon due to lack of proof of finality of conviction.
*   **RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) and Revised Penal Code (Estafa):** Basis of criminal conviction at Sandiganbayan.
*   **Buenafe v. COMELEC & Teves v. COMELEC:** Cited for definition of moral turpitude.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Proof of Finality of Criminal Conviction:** The Court did *not* rely on the Sandiganbayan conviction of Estafa and violation of RA 3019 as grounds for disbarment due to the absence of proof the decision had become final and executory. This highlights a procedural hurdle in disbarment cases based on criminal convictions.
*   **Service of Notice:** The Court acknowledged difficulties in serving notices to Atty. Monroy but deemed he waived his right to refute allegations due to his failure to update his address with the IBP, referencing *Ollada v. Laysa*.
*   **Retroactive Application of the CPRA:** The Court expressly applied the new CPRA to this pending case, citing its transitory provision. This confirms the broad application of the CPRA to ongoing disciplinary matters.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court disbarred Atty. Monroy, finding him in violation of the CPRA based on his conduct involving fraud and abuse of his government position. While a criminal conviction was initially considered, the disbarment ultimately rested on his ethical violations as a lawyer. The Court's decision reaffirms the high ethical standards expected of lawyers, especially those in public service. The reliance on the CPRA, with its retroactive application, underscores the Court's commitment to upholding these standards. The case highlights the importance of providing proof of the finality of criminal convictions in disbarment cases.
