**Case:** *Cherry J. Price, et al. v. Innodata Phils. Inc., et al.* G.R. No. 178505, September 30, 2008

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over the alleged illegal dismissal of formatters (petitioners) by Innodata, a data encoding company. The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) and National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) decisions, ruling that the petitioners were regular employees, not fixed-term or project employees, and were therefore illegally dismissed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Employment Contract:** A "Contract of Employment for a Fixed Period" was executed, stipulating a one-year term. The employer reserved the right to pre-terminate the contract under various conditions (completion of project, lack of work, business losses, new production processes, overstaffing), with short notice periods.
*   **Article 280 of the Labor Code:** Defines regular employment as engagement in activities necessary or desirable to the employer's usual business or trade, or after one year of service, regardless of initial employment status.
*   **Article 279 of the Labor Code:**  Guarantees security of tenure to regular employees, requiring just or authorized cause for termination.

**Liabilities & Remedies:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:**  Innodata's termination of petitioners' employment was found to be illegal due to the misclassification of employees.
*   **Reinstatement (in lieu of):** Reinstatement was impossible due to Innodata's closure.
*   **Separation Pay:**  Innodata was ordered to pay separation pay equivalent to one month's pay for every year of service, computed from the commencement of employment until the company's closure.
*   **Backwages:** Innodata was ordered to pay full backwages from the time the petitioners' compensation was withheld until the company's closure.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Petitioners were awarded 10% of the total monetary award for attorney's fees.
*   **Exemption of Individual Respondents:** The Court exempted individual respondents, Leo Rabang and Jane Navarette, from any personal liability for the illegal dismissal of petitioners in the absence of evidence that they acted with malice or bad faith.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Fixed-Term Contract Validity:**  The validity of the fixed-term contracts was challenged. The Court found the contracts were a circumvention of security of tenure due to the employer's reserved pre-termination rights and questionable contract alterations.
*   **Project Employee vs. Regular Employee:**  Innodata's claim that petitioners were project employees was rejected due to the lack of specificity in the contracts regarding the project's nature and duration, and the fact that petitioners worked on multiple projects.
*   **Ambiguous Contract Clauses:** The Court construed ambiguities in the contract of adhesion strictly against Innodata, the drafting party.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 279 & 280 of the Labor Code:** Defines Regular employment and the rights of a tenured regular employee.
*   ***Brent School, Inc. v. Zamora***:  Discusses the validity of fixed-term contracts but warns against using them to circumvent security of tenure.
*   ***Villanueva v. National Labor Relations Commission***:  Establishes that ambiguous contracts of adhesion are construed against the drafting party.
*   ***Philex Mining Corp. v. National Labor Relations Commission***: Defines "project employees".

**Legal Precision & Considerations:**

*   **Emphasis on Security of Tenure:** The decision strongly upholds the constitutional right to security of tenure and disallows contractual stipulations designed to circumvent this right.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The decision reiterates that the burden of proof in illegal dismissal cases rests on the employer.
*   **Corporate Liability:**  The decision clarifies the distinction between corporate and personal liability, exempting individual officers absent evidence of malice or bad faith.
