## Legal Document Summary: *Bernaldez Pen v. De Castro*

**Case:** *Alelio Bernaldez Pen v. Hon. Anita Amora De Castro*, G.R. No. 104645, July 23, 1998

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari challenging the issuance of an alias warrant of arrest.

**Key Provisions:**

*   Accused, Alelio Bernaldez Pen, was charged with Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale (Art. 38(a)(b) in relation to Art. 39(a) of the Labor Code).
*   Amended Information filed naming Pen as co-accused.
*   Trial court ordered preliminary investigation after initial failure to conduct one properly.
*   Despite the pending preliminary investigation, the trial court issued an alias warrant of arrest for Pen.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Pen):** Potential liability for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale, punishable under Art. 39(a) of the Labor Code (potentially life imprisonment and P100,000 fine).  Obligation to answer to charges after the trial.
*   **City Prosecutor:** Obligation to conduct a proper preliminary investigation.
*   **Trial Judge (De Castro):** Obligation to determine probable cause personally before issuing a warrant of arrest (Section 2, Article III, 1987 Philippine Constitution); obligation to balance defendant's right with the needs of justice and speedy administration of justice.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Propriety of Alias Warrant:** The central issue is whether the trial court erred in issuing the alias warrant while the preliminary investigation was ongoing. Petitioner argued violation of right to due process and lack of probable cause.
*   **Determination of Probable Cause:** Whether the Judge properly assessed probable cause *before* issuing the alias warrant.  The case hinges on whether the existing information, affidavits, and the fact that the accused was at large provided sufficient probable cause independent of the pending preliminary investigation.
*   **"Fugitive from Justice" Argument:** The Court used Pen being "at large" as one factor in upholding the alias warrant. This may be problematic if the original warrant was questionable.
*   **Delayed Preliminary Investigation:** Although a motion for preliminary investigation was filed, no actual order for it's suspension of all prior actions was granted by the court. The motion was filed but not acted upon until the court's decision.
*   **Reliance on Unrebutted Evidence:** Resolution mentioned that because Pen could not be subpoenaed, his lack of response counted against him.
    *   **Rule 112, Sec. 3(d):** If the respondent cannot be subpoenaed, the investigating officer shall base his resolution on the evidence presented by the complainant.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 38(a)(b) and 39(a) of the Labor Code:** Defines and penalizes Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale.
*   **Section 2, Article III, 1987 Philippine Constitution:** Guarantees the right against unreasonable searches and seizures, requiring probable cause for warrants.
*   **Section 3, Rule 112, 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Governs preliminary investigations.

**Case Law:**

*   ***Hadji Ibrahim Solay Pangandaman, et al. vs. Dimaporo T. Casar, as Municipal Circuit Trial Judge of Poonabayabao, et al., L-71782, April 14, 1988, 159 SCRA 599*** establishes the two phases of preliminary investigations.
*   ***Roberts, Jr. vs. Court of Appeals, 254 SCRA 307.*** states that a warrant can be issued if the judge is satisfied after an examination in writing and under oath of the complainant and the witnesses, in the form of searching questions and answers, that a probable cause exists and that there is a necessity of placing the respondent under immediate custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice.
*   ***Joaquin G. Bernas, “The Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines: A Commentary.” Vol. I., 1987 ed., p. 86 citing People vs. Sy Juco, 64 Phil. 674 (1937).*** defines probable cause as “such reasons, supported by facts and circumstances, as will warrant a cautious man in the belief that his action, and the means taken in prosecuting it, are legally just and proper.”
*   ***Webb vs. De Leon, 247 SCRA 653 (1995).*** defines probable cause to warrant arrest requires “such facts and circumstances which would lead a reasonably discreet and prudent man to believe that an offense has been committed by the person sought to be arrested.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Issues:**

*   The Court found that probable cause can be determined before the completion of the preliminary investigation.  Defense counsel could argue this improperly circumvented the right to a full preliminary investigation before a warrant issues.

**Outcome:** Petition DISMISSED. The Court upheld the trial court's Order and alias warrant of arrest, finding no grave abuse of discretion.

**Strategic Implications:**

The case highlights the interplay between the right to a preliminary investigation and the power of the court to issue arrest warrants.  The decision gives significant weight to the court's assessment of probable cause based on available evidence, even while the preliminary investigation is ongoing.  It also suggests that being at large strengthens the justification for issuing an arrest warrant.
