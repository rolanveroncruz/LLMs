**Case:** *Paguio Transport Corporation vs. National Labor Relations Commission and Wilfredo Melchor*, G.R. No. 119500, August 28, 1998 (356 Phil. 158)

**Summary:**

This Supreme Court decision affirms the NLRC's ruling that Wilfredo Melchor was illegally dismissed by Paguio Transport Corporation. The Court reiterates established labor law doctrines regarding the "boundary system," just cause for termination, due process, strained relations, and remedies for illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The Court confirms that the "boundary system" (P650/trip) establishes an employer-employee relationship between taxi owners and drivers (citing *Martinez v. NLRC*, 272 SCRA 793). Paguio Transport had supervisory control.
*   **Just Cause for Termination:**  The employer bears the burden of proving just cause for dismissal (Art. 282, Labor Code). The employer's allegation of reckless driving causing multiple accidents was unsubstantiated.
*   **Due Process:**  Dismissal requires two written notices: (1) notice of the specific acts/omissions leading to dismissal, and (2) notice of the employer's decision to dismiss.  Also requires opportunity to be heard (*Conti v. NLRC*, 271 SCRA 114). Paguio Transport failed to provide these notices.
*   **Reinstatement and Back Wages:**  Illegal dismissal entitles the employee to reinstatement without loss of seniority and full back wages from the time compensation was withheld until actual reinstatement (Art. 279, Labor Code). *Bustamante v. NLRC*, 265 SCRA 61, establishes that "full backwages" means *without* deducting earnings derived elsewhere during the dismissal period.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Paguio Transport Corporation:** Liable for reinstatement of Wilfredo Melchor and payment of full back wages (modified by NLRC to P86,400, based on P600/day assumption of the illegally dismissed worker).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Strained Relations:** Paguio Transport unsuccessfully argued "strained relations" to avoid reinstatement. The Court emphasized this must be *demonstrated as a fact*, not merely presumed due to the filing of a labor dispute (*Capili vs. NLRC*, 270 SCRA 488).
*   **Evidence on Appeal:** Petitioner attempted to submit police reports and prosecutor's resolution for the first time on appeal to the Supreme Court. The court denied this admission of evidence, because it is not a trier of facts.
*   **Computation of Backwages:** The computation method for back wages can be contentious.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Articles 279, 282, 283**: Governing termination of employment, just cause, and authorized causes for dismissal.
*   **Art. 221 Labor Code**: states Technical rules not binding and prior resort to amicable settlement.
*   **Martinez v. NLRC, 272 SCRA 793**:  Establishes the employer-employee relationship in "boundary system" arrangements.
*   **Bustamante v. NLRC, 265 SCRA 61**: Defines "full backwages."
*   **Capili vs. NLRC, 270 SCRA 488**: addresses strained relations.
*   **Doce v. WCC,[5] 104 Phil. 946, December 22, 1958** states that “the relationship created between the parties operating under a ‘boundary system’ is one of an employer and employee, and not of a lessor and a lessee.
*   **PMI Colleges v. NLRC,[18] GR No. 121466, August 15, 1997**: Factual issues are not a proper subject for certiorari, as the power of the Supreme Court to review labor cases is limited to the issue of jurisdiction and grave abuse of discretion.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The computation of the back wages, although modified by the NLRC, was not challenged by either party. The Court upheld the NLRC's calculation but emphasized that the back wages period extends until actual reinstatement, potentially creating future disputes over the exact amount owed.
