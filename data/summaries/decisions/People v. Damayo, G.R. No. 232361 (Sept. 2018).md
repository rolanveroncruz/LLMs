**Case:** People of the Philippines vs. Francisco Damayo y Jaime (G.R. No. 232361, September 26, 2018)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Francisco Damayo for Kidnapping for Ransom under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code. The RTC and CA found Damayo guilty beyond reasonable doubt for kidnapping an 11-year-old boy, Jerome Rosario, and demanding a ransom of P150,000.00. The Court highlighted the consistent and credible testimony of the victim, Jerome, and his mother, Edna.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 267, Revised Penal Code (Kidnapping for Ransom):** Damayo was indicted under this article, which defines and penalizes the crime of kidnapping for ransom. The elements of the crime, as established in the case, include: (a) the offender is a private individual; (b) he kidnaps or detains another, or in any manner deprives the latter of his liberty; (c) the act of detention or kidnapping must be illegal; and (d) the kidnapping was for the purpose of extortion, regardless of the duration of detainment.
*   **Obligation to Pay Civil Indemnity, Moral Damages, and Exemplary Damages:** Damayo is ordered to pay P100,000.00 each for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to the victim, Jerome. These are consistent with current jurisprudence regarding damages in kidnapping cases.
*   **Penalty of Reclusion Perpetua (without eligibility for parole):** Due to Republic Act No. 9346 (prohibiting the death penalty), Damayo was sentenced to reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole.  The "without eligibility for parole" qualification is applied because the death penalty would have been imposed were it not for RA 9346.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Damayo is criminally liable for Kidnapping for Ransom.
*   **Civil Liability:** Damayo is civilly liable for the damages caused to the victim and his family (P100,000 each of Civil indemnity, Moral and Exemplary damages).  Interest at 6% per annum is imposed on all damages from the finality of the Decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Damayo argued that inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses (Jerome and Edna) should have resulted in his acquittal. The court rejected this argument, stating that the minor discrepancies didn't undermine the overall credibility of their accounts.
*   **Defense of Denial/Alleged Affair:** Damayo claimed he was having an affair with Edna and acted on her instructions to take Jerome, but that was rejected by the court who put more weight to the testimony of Edna.
*   **Qualifying Circumstance of Extortion:** The court affirmed that the prosecution adequately established that the kidnapping was for the purpose of extortion.
*   **No actual payment:** Actual payment of ransom is not necessary for the crime to be committed. It is enough that the kidnapping was committed for the purpose of extorting ransom.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines Kidnapping for Ransom.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty in the Philippines.
*   **A.M. No. 15-08-02-SC:** Guidelines for the Proper Use of the Phrase "Without Eligibility for Parole" in Indivisible Penalties.
*   The decision cites several cases relating to the elements of Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention, witness credibility, child testimony, and damages. For instance, *People v. Anticamara, et al., 666 Phil. 484, 511 (2011)* re: elements of the crime.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   None apparent from the summary, though Damayo likely perceived the application of the law to his version of the facts as contentious. The Court unequivocally rejected his defense.
