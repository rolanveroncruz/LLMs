**Summary of *Moreno v. Bragat*, A.M. No. P-94-1072 (1998)**

**Case Overview:** This is an administrative case against Vilma A. Bragat, a Clerk II, for grave misconduct, slander by deed, oral defamation, and falsification of a public document (her Daily Time Record or DTR). The charges stem from an incident where Bragat allegedly assaulted and defamed Marites R. Moreno at Moreno's workplace, and subsequently falsified her DTR to conceal her absence from the office.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Falsification of Public Document (DTR):** The Court found Bragat guilty of falsifying her DTR by claiming she was at the MCTC the entire day when she was actually at the Singer/World Appliance Center. This is a violation of Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code (Falsification by Public Officers).
*   **Violation of Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 5 (1988):** Bragat admitted to being a part-time sales agent, which directly violates the prohibition against Judiciary employees engaging in outside employment to ensure full-time dedication to government service. This circular is aimed at maintaining public confidence in the Judiciary.
*   **Misconduct/Scandalous Behavior:** While the assault itself was not work-related, the Court held that such behavior, especially while claiming to be on official business, degraded the image of the judiciary. This relates to Section 46 of the Civil Service Law, which defines misconduct.
*   **Acquittal in Criminal Cases Irrelevant:** The RTC acquittal of Bragat on appeal for slander by deed and grave oral defamation, based on reasonable doubt, did not preclude the Court from finding her administratively liable. The standard of proof is lower in administrative proceedings. See *Gratela v. Yonzon, Jr.*, A.M. Nos. P-91-590 & P-93-818, 256 SCRA 587.
*   **Official Travel as Subterfuge:** The Court deemed Bragat's claim of official travel to the Public Attorney's Office (PAO) as a mere pretext to mask her intention to confront Moreno.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Bragat had the obligation to accurately record her attendance in her DTR.
*   She was obligated to comply with Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 5 and refrain from outside employment.
*   She had the obligation to conduct herself in a manner befitting a Judiciary employee, both on and off duty.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Official Time" vs. Personal Time:** The ambiguity surrounding Bragat's official travel authorization. The lack of specificity in the Clerk of Court's certification leaves room for dispute.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The conviction relies heavily on circumstantial evidence, like the testimony of the driver and medical certificate, to contradict Bragat's version of events.
*   **Proportionality of Penalty:** The Executive Judge recommended a 15-day suspension, which was deemed too lenient by the Supreme Court, resulting in dismissal. This highlights the Court's serious view of the offense.

**Case Law References:**

*   *Gratela v. Yonzon, Jr.*, A.M. Nos. P-91-590 & P-93-818, 256 SCRA 587: Addresses the distinct standards of proof in criminal versus administrative proceedings.
*   *Orfila v. Quiroz*, A.M. No. P-97-1234: Highlights the need for judicial employees to act with propriety and decorum at all times.
*   *Tablate v. Tanjutco-Seechung*, A.M. No. 92-10-425-OMB, 234 SCRA 161.
*   *Apaga v. Ponce*, A.M. No. P-95-1119, 245 SCRA 233: Reinforces the State policy of promoting high ethical standards in public service as enshrined in RA No. 6713.

**Outcome:** Bragat was DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government.
