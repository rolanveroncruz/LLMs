## Legal Document Summary: *Sigma Homebuilding Corporation vs. Inter-Alia Management Corporation et al.* G.R. No. 177898

**Nature:** Resolution denying Petitioner's (Sigma Homebuilding Corporation) "letter-appeal," effectively a prohibited second Motion for Reconsideration, regarding a complaint for annulment of sale, cancellation of titles, reconveyance, and damages.

**Background:** Sigma sued Inter-Alia, DBR, Intercon, Hasting Realty, and the Register of Deeds of Cavite, alleging its properties were fraudulently sold by its AVP Parcero to Inter-Alia without authorization. Inter-Alia sold to DBR, DBR to Intercon, and Intercon to Hasting. The RTC dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, finding the properties had passed to innocent purchasers for value. The CA and the Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. Sigma then filed a petition for annulment of the RTC order, alleging lack of jurisdiction, which the CA denied due to the prior availment of appeal.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Grounds for Complaint:** Unauthorized sale of property by AVP, lack of board resolution authorizing the sale.
*   **Basis for Dismissal:** Failure to state a cause of action; properties passed to innocent purchasers for value.
*   **Attempted Annulment of Judgment (Rule 47, Rules of Court):** Argued RTC lacked jurisdiction by dismissing against all respondents when only Hasting moved for dismissal. This was denied because an appeal on the merits was already taken.
*   **Real Party in Interest (Rule 3, Rules of Court):** The Court determined that only Sigma and Hasting were real parties in interest.
*   **Prohibited Second Motion for Reconsideration (Rule 56-B, Rules of Court):** The Court found Sigma's letter-appeal to be an impermissible attempt to circumvent final and executory judgments.
*   **Finality of Judgment:** Court emphasizes the need for litigation to end and upholds the principle of *res judicata*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Sigma Homebuilding:** Liable for treble costs. Estopped from further litigation on the matter.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Sanctions for Frivolous Litigation:** Further attempts to relitigate the matter could result in additional sanctions.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 3 (Real Party in Interest), Rule 47 (Annulment of Judgments), Rule 56-B (Procedure in Supreme Court, specifically prohibiting second motions for reconsideration).
*   **Veneracion v. Mancilla, G.R. No. 158238, 20 July 2006, 495 SCRA 712, 724**
*   **Republic v. "G" Holdings, G.R. No. 141241, 22 November 2005, 475 SCRA 608, 617**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The core contention revolves around the initial unauthorized sale and whether subsequent purchasers were bona fide. However, these issues were effectively mooted by procedural bars and the failure to properly contest the AVP's authority during the initial stages.

**Conclusion:**

This case is closed and cannot be relitigated. Sigma Homebuilding faces potential sanctions if it persists in attempting to reopen the matter.
