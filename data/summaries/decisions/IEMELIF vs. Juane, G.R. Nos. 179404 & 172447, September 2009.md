## Legal Document Summary: IEMELIF vs. Juane (G.R. Nos. 172447 & 179404)

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari arising from an Unlawful Detainer action (Rule 70, Rules of Court).

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner/Plaintiff:** Iglesia Evangelica Metodista en las Islas Filipinas (IEMELIF), Inc. (Religious Corporation)
*   **Respondent/Defendant:** Rev. Natanael B. Juane (Former Pastor)

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   IEMELIF owns property (TCT Nos. 62080 & 14366) where its Cathedral, pastor's residence, and school are located.
*   Juane was assigned as Resident Pastor of the Tondo Cathedral Congregation, authorized to reside on the premises. This assignment was renewed annually.
*   Juane was reassigned to the Sta. Mesa Congregation on March 3, 2002, terminating his authority over the Tondo Cathedral premises.
*   On May 10, 2002, the Highest Consistory of Elders expelled Juane as pastor for acts of defiance.
*   IEMELIF demanded Juane vacate the premises on May 23, 2002, but he refused.
*   IEMELIF filed an Unlawful Detainer action against Juane in the MeTC.
*   Juane disputed his reassignment and expulsion and argued the complaint involved intra-corporate controversy, falling within the jurisdiction of the RTC under the Securities Regulation Code.

**Issues:**

1.  **Jurisdiction (G.R. No. 172447):** Does the Complaint constitute an intra-corporate dispute, thus depriving the MeTC of jurisdiction? Held in the negative. Jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint. _Magay v. Estiandan, Abrin v. Campos_.
2.  **Propriety of Ejectment (G.R. No. 179404):** Did IEMELIF have the legal capacity to eject Juane, considering his argument that IEMELIF's transformation from a corporation sole to a corporation aggregate was defective? Held in the affirmative.

**Rulings:**

*   **G.R. No. 172447 (Jurisdiction):** The Supreme Court *GRANTED* IEMELIF's Petition. The Unlawful Detainer action was properly filed in the MeTC because it involved the recovery of physical possession based on the termination of Juane's authorized stay, not the validity of his reassignment or expulsion. The reassignment and expulsion are simply the termination of the contract, express or implied, that gave him authority to stay on the land.
*   **G.R. No. 179404 (Ejectment):** The Supreme Court *DENIED* Juane's Petition.  The transformation issue was irrelevant. Either as a corporation sole (Bishop Lazaro) or a corporation aggregate (Highest Consistory of Elders), IEMELIF had the authority to appoint and remove Juane from his pastoral assignment. The Court emphasized that the issue in unlawful detainer is *de facto* possession, not ownership. _Del Rosario v. Jimenez, Guzman v. Court of Appeals, Sy v. Court of Appeals, Co v. Militar, Barnes v. Padilla, Umpoc v. Mercado._. Furthermore, factual findings of the lower courts are binding on the Supreme Court.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Juane is obligated to:**
    *   Vacate the IEMELIF property, including the cathedral, pastoral house, school, and church premises in Tondo, Manila.
    *   Peacefully turn over possession to IEMELIF.
    *   Pay attorney's fees of P10,000 and the costs of the suit.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Corporation Sole vs. Corporation Aggregate Status:** While the Court downplayed its impact, a defective transformation could potentially open IEMELIF to future challenges regarding its authority over property and internal governance. However, this issue was not crucial to this unlawful detainer case.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70, Rules of Court:** Unlawful Detainer
*   **Republic Act No. 8799 (Securities Regulation Code):** Jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes (now governed by the Revised Corporation Code, specifically regarding internal disputes)
*   **Corporation Code, Section 110:** Definition of Corporation Sole
*   **Magay v. Estiandan (69 SCRA 456):** Jurisdiction based on the allegations in the complaint.
*   **Abrin v. Campos (203 SCRA 420):** Jurisdiction based on the allegations in the complaint.
*   **Del Rosario v. Jimenez (118 Phil. 565):** Action for reconveyance does not bar an ejectment case.
*   **Guzman v. Court of Appeals (177 SCRA 604):** Action for reconveyance does not bar an ejectment case.
*   **Sy v. Court of Appeals (200 SCRA 117):** Action for reconveyance does not bar an ejectment case.
*   **Co v. Militar (466 Phil. 217):** Issue in ejectment cases is *de facto* possession.
*   **Barnes v. Padilla (461 SCRA 533):** Purpose of ejectment cases is to restore physical possession.
*   **Umpoc v. Mercado (449 SCRA 220):** Ownership may only be provisionally ruled upon to determine *de facto* possession.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** None explicitly stated in the provided decision; however, the underlying tension regarding the propriety of the transformation of the corporation remains a potential future source of conflict.
