## Legal Document Summary: People v. Lopez, Jr. G.R. No. 232247 (2018)

**Type:** Criminal Case - Appeal of Parricide Conviction

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Holding:** Affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision finding Ronillo Lopez, Jr. guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Parricide under Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Ronillo Lopez, Jr. charged with Parricide for the death of his father, Ronillo Lopez, Sr., by stabbing.
*   **Defense:** Ronillo admitted to the stabbing but claimed self-defense. The defense argued the father was the initial aggressor.
*   **Self-Defense Elements:** The Court reiterated the requirements for self-defense: (1) unlawful aggression by the victim; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation by the accused.  Referenced *Razon v. People, 552 Phil. 359 (2007)*.
*   **Unlawful Aggression:** The critical element of unlawful aggression by the father was not proven. The court relied on the absence of significant injuries on the accused, contradicting his claim of a severe beating, as well as the nature, gravity, and location of the victim's stab wound. Referenced *People v. Nugas, 677 Phil. 168 (2011).* The Court also cited *Macalino, Jr. v. People, 394 Phil. 309 (2000)* regarding the burden of proof when self-defense is pleaded.
*   **Reasonable Necessity:** The means employed (stabbing the father in the chest with a kitchen knife) was deemed unreasonable and excessive, especially considering the father was allegedly intoxicated.
*   **Inconsistent Behavior:** The Court noted that the accused did not report the incident as self-defense immediately, nor did he surrender the weapon. Flight from the scene was considered an indication of guilt. Referenced *People v. Diaz, 443 Phil. 67 (2003)*.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Court gave credence to the testimony of the prosecution's medical expert who found no injuries on the accused, dismissing the defense's argument regarding the time it takes for injuries to appear.
*   **Elements of Parricide:** The Court confirmed that all elements of Parricide were met: (1) death of the victim; (2) accused caused the death; and (3) familial relationship (father-son).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Ronillo Lopez, Jr.):**  Convicted of Parricide.  Sentenced to *Reclusion Perpetua*.  Ordered to pay actual damages (P60,000), civil indemnity (P75,000), moral damages (P75,000), and exemplary damages (P75,000).
*   **State:** Successfully prosecuted the case, demonstrating guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity in "Reasonable Necessity":**  The determination of whether the means employed in self-defense were "reasonable" is inherently subjective and fact-dependent.
*   **Reliance on Lack of Visible Injury:** The reliance on the lack of visible injuries on the accused as definitive proof against the claim of unlawful aggression could be challenged.  The absence of visible injuries doesn't definitively negate the occurrence of an attack.
*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony**: The court highlighted inconsistencies in the defense's testimony and stance, suggesting lack of credibilty.
*   **Sentencing:** No parole eligibility due to the crime of Parricide.
*   **Interest:** A 6% per annum interest is imposed on all damages from the date of finality until fully paid.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 246:** Defines and penalizes Parricide.
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016):** Establishes the amounts for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in murder/homicide cases.
*   **People v. Romobio, G.R. No. 227705, October 11, 2017** - Confirmed imposition of 6% interest per annum.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction based on the failure of the accused to adequately prove self-defense. The absence of unlawful aggression by the victim was the crucial factor, supported by the lack of evidence of injury to the accused and the nature of the fatal wound.  The sentence and damages were upheld, with the inclusion of interest.
