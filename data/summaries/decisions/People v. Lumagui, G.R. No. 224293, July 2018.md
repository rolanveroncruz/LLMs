## Legal Document Summary: People v. Lumagui, G.R. No. 224293

**Nature of the Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court reversing the Court of Appeals and acquitting the accused-appellant, Allan Lumagui, of violations of Sections 11 and 26, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charges:** Lumagui was charged with:
    *   Possession of 0.12 grams of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (shabu) (Sec. 11, Art. II, RA 9165).
    *   Conspiracy with co-accused Rueda to sell 0.02 grams of shabu in a buy-bust operation (Sec. 26, Art. II, RA 9165).
*   **Chain of Custody:** The SC emphasizes the critical importance of establishing an unbroken chain of custody for the seized drugs, citing existing jurisprudence (e.g., *People v. Jaafar*, *Belmonte v. People*, *People v. Macud*). The chain of custody is defined through seizure/marking, turnover to investigating officer, turnover to forensic chemist, and presentation in court.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 and its IRR:** The decision extensively discusses the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) regarding the handling, inventory, and photographing of seized drugs in the presence of specific witnesses.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** Discusses when presumption of regularity will not hold.
*   **Reasonable Doubt:** The SC acquits based on reasonable doubt, emphasizing the accused's constitutional right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Obligations:**

*   **Prosecution:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving all elements of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. This includes establishing an unbroken chain of custody for the seized drugs.
*   **Law Enforcement:** Apprehending officers have a strict duty to comply with the procedures outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR, or to provide justifiable grounds for any non-compliance, to ensure the integrity and evidentiary value of seized drugs.

**Liabilities:**

*   N/A - Accused Acquitted.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Breaks in the Chain of Custody:** The SC identified multiple breaks in the chain of custody:
    *   Conflicting testimony regarding *when* markings were placed on the seized items. Photo evidence contradicted PO1 Cruz's testimony.
    *   Lack of evidence of physical inventory, as required by Sec. 21(a). The court rejected recording the event in the barangay blotter as a sufficient substitute.
    *   No record of who possessed the drugs between the crime scene and the police station.
    *   Failure to establish how PO2 Llorente came into possession of the drugs before delivery to the laboratory and his authority to deliver the same.
    *   The stipulation regarding the forensic chemist's (Ong-Rodrigo's) testimony failed to include crucial details about the receipt, sealing, and marking of the evidence, leading to doubts about the integrity of the examination. No proof as to the safekeeping and transfer of drugs from the laboratory to the court.
*   **Inconsistent Testimonies Regarding the Buy-Bust Operation:** The SC found inconsistencies in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses regarding key aspects of the alleged buy-bust operation:
    *   PO1 Cruz and PO2 Llorente provided conflicting accounts of who served as the poseur-buyer.
    *   Conflicting accounts regarding the pre-arranged signal for the consummation of the sale.
    *   There was no secured warrant of arrest from the court.
*   **Overreliance on Presumption of Regularity:** The RTC and CA erroneously relied on the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty by the police officers, despite the significant gaps and inconsistencies in the evidence. The SC emphasized that the presumption of regularity cannot overcome the accused's constitutional right to be presumed innocent.
*   **Lack of Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance with Sec. 21:** The prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for the police officers' non-compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002)**: The core statute at issue.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 and its IRR:**  Specific provisions regarding chain of custody requirements.
*   **People v. Jaafar, G.R. No. 219829:** Establishes that corpus delicti is dangerous drug itself.
*   **Belmonte v. People, G.R. No. 224143:** Highlights need for prosecution to account for each link in the chain of custody.
*   **People v. Macud, G.R. No. 219175:**  Outlines the chain of custody, including possession by the arresting officer, transfer to the investigation officer, turnover to forensic chemist, and turnover to court.
*   **People v. Pajarin, 654 Phil. 461, 466 (2011).** Chemist should testify that he received the seized article as marked, properly sealed and intact.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decisions due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. The SC held that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty cannot overcome the accused's constitutional right to be presumed innocent. This case underscores the importance of strict adherence to the procedures outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR in drug-related prosecutions.
