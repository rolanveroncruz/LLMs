## Legal Document Summary: *Norgie Cruz y Castro v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 164580)

**Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to overturn a Court of Appeals decision affirming conviction for illegal sale of shabu.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Illegal Sale of Shabu (Violation of Section 15, Article III, RA 6425 as amended by RA 7659). The CA acquitted the petitioner of illegal possession of shabu because the search of the petitioner's house was deemed illegal, and the shabu obtained from the house was excluded as evidence
*   **Elements of Illegal Sale:** Established: (1) Identity of buyer and seller, object, and consideration; (2) Delivery of the thing sold and its payment (citing *People v. Macabalang*).

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioner was obligated to refrain from the illegal sale of shabu.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner was found liable for illegal sale of shabu.
*   Initially sentenced by RTC to imprisonment ranging from six months of arresto mayor as minimum to four years, two months and one day of prision correccional as maximum. The CA affirmed.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Affirmance of the conviction and possible re-incarceration.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6425 (as amended by RA 7659):** Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, specifically Section 15, Article III (Illegal Sale) and Section 16, Article III (Illegal Possession)
*   **People v. Macabalang (G.R. No. 168694):** Established elements of illegal sale of shabu.
*   **People v. Lacbanes (336 Phil. 933 (1997):** Failure of the poseur-buyer to testify on the actual purchase is not fatal to the prosecution's cause.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's arguments:**
    *   Failure to present poseur-buyer as a witness. (Rejected, as the Court cites the rule that the testimony of the poseur-buyer is not indispensable)
    *   Failure to present buy-bust money. (Rejected, court states it is merely corroborative evidence)
    *   Claimed inconsistencies in police testimonies (Rejected, the court states the inconsistencies regard the credibility of witnesses and is a question of fact)
    *   Arguments concerning alleged violations of petitioner's constitutional rights (rejected, the court states the declaration of the Court of Appeals that the search of his house was unconstitutional does not mean the presumption of regularity has been rebutted).
*   The validity of the search of the petitioner's house without a warrant was a key contentious point, though ultimately did not impact the sale charge.

**Notes**

The court ultimately denied the petition for review, and affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals.
