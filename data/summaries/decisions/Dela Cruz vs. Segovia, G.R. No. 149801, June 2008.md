**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Renato and Florinda Dela Cruz vs. Spouses Gil and Leonila Segovia*, G.R. No. 149801, June 26, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC decision dismissing a complaint for Nullity of Contract/Agreement with Damages.

**Key Provisions & Agreements:**

*   **Verbal Agreement (July 1985):** Florinda (Petitioner) and Leonila (Respondent), sisters, agreed to jointly purchase two properties. Leonila would own Lot 503 with apartment after paying P80,000.00; Florinda would own Lot 505 with residential house. Leonila and family would stay at Lot 505 until Lot 503 was fully paid.
*   **Note of Agreement (April 28, 1990):** Handwritten document outlining payment terms for Lot 503. Specifies P18,000 with 2% interest and P34,000 without interest, both payable by 1999. Florinda collects apartment rent in exchange for residence at house.
*   **Agreement (September 9, 1991):** Formal contract prepared by sister Linda. Leonila agreed to pay Florinda P34,000 in installments over 10 years, with no specific monthly amount. Real property at 505B Paltok Street (TCT #177862) secured the loan, with rents of P1,200 collected by Florinda. If payment not made in 10 years, Florinda takes ownership of 505B Paltok St.

**Obligations:**

*   **Leonila Segovia:** Obligated to pay Florinda Dela Cruz the remaining balance of P34,000.00 for Lot 503 under the terms of the September 9, 1991 Agreement.
*   **Florinda Dela Cruz:** Obligated to transfer ownership of Lot 503 to Leonila upon full payment.

**Liabilities:**

*   The petitioners (Spouses Dela Cruz) were ordered to surrender ownership of the property, and to pay attorney fees in the amount of P50,000.00 to the respondents.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Statute of Limitations:** The core issue is whether the action for annulment, based on alleged mistake, prescribed. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' finding that the four-year prescriptive period under Article 1391 of the Civil Code began on September 9, 1991 (date of the Agreement), and thus the March 8, 1996 complaint was filed too late.
*   **Consent of Renato dela Cruz:** Petitioners argued the Agreement was invalid because Renato (Florinda's husband) did not sign it, citing Article 124 of the Family Code. The Court found that this article wasn't applicable and the absence of Renato's signature was immaterial because the agreement didn't involve conjugal assets.
*   **Parol Evidence Rule & Interpretation of Contracts:** The Petitioners tried to invoke a verbal agreement stating a different commencement date.
*   **Ambiguity/Inconsistencies:** The *Note of Agreement* and the *Agreement* have slightly different terms, but the latter explicitly supersedes previous agreements. This could have been litigated to clarify which agreement held more weight, but the Supreme Court did not address this due to the prescription ruling.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 1391:** Governs the prescriptive period for actions for annulment.
*   **Family Code, Article 124:**  Concerns the administration and disposition of conjugal property.
*   *Isaias F. Fabrigas and Marcelina R. Fabrigas v. San Francisco Del Monte, Inc.*, G.R. No. 152346, November 25, 2005: Cited regarding factual findings of lower courts not subject to review at a later stage.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Paragraph 3 of the Agreement:** "The borrowers (Sps. Segovia) agree to put their real property located at 505 B Paltok St., Sta. Mesa, Mla., with TCT # 177862- Registry of deeds (public document) as guarantees for the above loan, which has a monthly rent of P1,200.00 and will be collected by the Lender (Florinda) as part of the agreement of the loan.": The clause suggests that the respondents may not have been aware of the true nature of the document they were signing, and whether the guarantee was a true transfer of ownership.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Agreement, primarily because the action to annul it was time-barred under Article 1391 of the Civil Code. The court also rejected the argument that the absence of the husband's signature invalidated the agreement, because the Court determined the lack of transfer of marital assets.
