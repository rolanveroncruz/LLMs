## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. MTJ-23-017

**Case:** *Aldrin B. Magaoay vs. Hon. Ateneones S. Bacale*

**Nature:** Administrative complaint charging Judge Bacale with gross misconduct in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   Complainant (Magaoay) alleges Judge Bacale, in conspiracy with his wife (Romilda Bacale, Executive Secretary to then Mayor Estrada) and Joaquin Ashley Dela Cruz (Judge Bacale's assistant), defrauded him of PHP 20,000,000.00 by promising a facilitated medical supply contract with the City of Manila, circumventing the required bidding process.
*   Judge Bacale allegedly received PHP 100,000.00 from Magaoay as an "accreditation fee." (Documented by photo evidence of Judge Bacale counting money)
*   Judge Bacale admits to meeting Magaoay and receiving a sealed envelope from him but denies knowledge of its contents and denies promising to secure a contract.
*   Romilda Bacale admits to receiving around PHP 18,000,000.00 from Magaoay, which she gave to Casimiran and Madayag, also claiming she was deceived by her colleagues.

**JIB Findings & Recommendations:**

*   The Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) found Judge Bacale guilty of gross misconduct, specifically violating Sections 1 & 2 of Canon 2 (Integrity) and Sections 1 & 2 of Canon 4 (Propriety) of the Code of Judicial Conduct.
*   The JIB recommended dismissal from service, forfeiture of benefits (excluding accrued leave credits), and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office.
*   Additionally, the JIB recommended disbarment for violating Sections 1, 2, & 12 of Canon II, and Section 2 of Canon III of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), and requested his name to be stricken from the Roll of Attorneys.

**Court Ruling & Justification:**

*   The Court adopted the JIB's recommendations with modification.
*   The Court found Judge Bacale *GUILTY* of **gross misconduct**.
*   **Sanction:** Dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all benefits (except accrued leave benefits), and disqualification from re-employment in any government branch.
*   **Rationale:** Judge Bacale knowingly participated in an illegal manipulation of the bidding process, acted as his wife's "bag man", used his judicial position to give Magaoay the impression that the irregular project would proceed, therefore violating RA 7160 Secs. 356 and 366, in relation to RA 3019 Sec. 3(e)
*   The court cited *Office of the Court Administrator v. Reyes, A.M. No. RTJ-20-2579* and *Tan v. Rosete, 481 Phil. 189, 202*, to emphasize the high standards of conduct expected of judges.
*   The court cited *Tobias v. Limsiaco, Jr., 655 Phil. 1, 10-11* and *Gacad v. Clapis, Jr., 691 Phil. 126, 136* in defining and emphasizing the existence of the *gross misconduct*.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conspiracy:** While the Court found Judge Bacale guilty of gross misconduct, the extent of his direct involvement in the alleged fraud remains open to interpretation. The focus is on his violation of judicial conduct rather than a definitive finding of conspiracy.
*   **Disbarment Proceedings:** Judge Bacale has been ordered to show cause why he should not be disbarred, in line with the ruling in *Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Eliza B. Yu, 800 Phil. 307* and pursuant to A.M. No. 02-9-02-SC. The success of the potential disbarment depends on his response and any additional evidence presented.
*   **Withdrawal of Complaint:** Complainant's initial withdrawal motion is irrelevant, as the Court retains the power to investigate and punish judicial misconduct independently.
