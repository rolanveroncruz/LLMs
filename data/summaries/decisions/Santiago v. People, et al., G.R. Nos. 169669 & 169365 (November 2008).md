**Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 169365 & 169669 (Consolidated)**

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 assailing CA decisions that reversed RTC orders granting the withdrawal of Informations for murder, frustrated murder, and illegal possession of firearms.

**Key Provisions & Ruling:**

*   **Resolution:** The Supreme Court denied the consolidated petitions due to petitioners' (Spouses Santiago) failure to properly serve copies of the petitions on respondents Lantoria and Mas.

*   **Service Issues:** The petitioners attempted service on respondents Lantoria and Mas by sending copies of the petitions to the deceased lawyer Atty. Navarro. The Court highlighted that with Atty. Navarro's death, the lawyer-client relationship was terminated, and service should have been made directly on the respondents per Section 7, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court. The Court deemed the service of the petition was insufficient.

*   **Addresses:**  Petitioners admitted to not knowing the whereabouts of Lantoria and Mas, even before Atty. Navarro's death. Mrs. Navarro could not provide addresses of Lantoria and Mas.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioners had the obligation to properly serve copies of the petition on all respondents.

**Liabilities:**

*   The petitioners' failure to properly serve all respondents led to the denial of the consolidated petitions.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The denial of the petitions leaves the CA decisions intact, effectively reinstating the criminal cases against the Petitioners.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Section 5, Rule 45 and Section 5(d), Rule 56 of the Rules of Court:** Basis for the denial of the petitions due to failure to submit proof of service and to effect proper service.
*   **Section 7, Rule 13 of the Rules:** Addresses service of papers.
*   This case hinges primarily on procedural deficiencies (improper service) rather than substantive legal issues regarding the murder, frustrated murder, and illegal possession of firearms charges.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The issue surrounding the inclusion of "People of the Philippines" as a respondent, though clarified by the Court, initially presented some ambiguity regarding the proper parties.
*   The petitioners' argument of using the deceased counsel's address for "expediency" raises ethical concerns, although not explicitly addressed by the Court.
*   The lack of known address of Lantoria and Mas is a significant factor and highlights a potentially problematic situation, suggesting a deliberate effort to avoid service.

**Recommendations:**

*   Consider the statutes of limitations of the charges and if they are still active.
*   Identify the strategy in facing the reopened charges.
*   Consider seeking relief to reverse the procedural deficiencies.
