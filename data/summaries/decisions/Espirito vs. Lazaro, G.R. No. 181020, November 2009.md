**Case Summary: *Espiritu v. Lazaro*, G.R. No. 181020 (2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmation of the trial court's dismissal of a case for failure to prosecute.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioners (Espiritu and Lazaro, Jr.), along with Mariquit Lazaro, filed a complaint against Respondents (Vladimir Lazaro et al., China Banking Corporation, and Winifrida Sison) for recovery of personal property (USD time deposit accounts of the deceased Porfirio Lazaro, Sr.) and damages.
*   Petitioners claimed entitlement to a share of the deceased's time deposit accounts, alleging the funds were transferred to Respondent children and the bank refused to disclose account details citing the Bank Secrecy Law.
*   Preliminary attachment was granted and levied on five real properties.
*   Respondents filed motions to dismiss and to discharge the attachment, which were denied. They appealed, which was eventually denied by the Supreme Court.
*   Respondents then filed a "Cautionary Answer" reserving the right to file a Supplemental/Amended Answer.
*   Trial court dismissed the case *motu proprio* for failure to prosecute, noting Petitioners' failure to set the case for pre-trial after the "Cautionary Answer" was filed.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Duty to Prosecute:** Section 1, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court (duty of the plaintiff to set the case for pre-trial after the last pleading is served and filed).  Petitioners failed to do so after receiving the Cautionary Answer.
*   **Dismissal for Failure to Prosecute:** Section 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court (dismissal for failure to prosecute for an unreasonable length of time or failure to comply with the rules).  The trial court invoked this provision.
*   **Last Pleading:** The court determined the "Cautionary Answer" constituted the "last pleading", triggering Petitioner's duty to set a pre-trial.
*   **A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC:** Petitioners argued that the Clerk of Court also has a duty to set the pre-trial. The Court held that since the relevant events occurred *before* the effectivity of A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC, it was inapplicable.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:**  Had the obligation to diligently prosecute the case, including timely setting the case for pre-trial after the filing of the last pleading (the Cautionary Answer in this case).  Their inaction resulted in dismissal.
*   **Respondents:**  While not explicitly stated, implicit is the duty to file a proper answer and participate in pre-trial upon being served.
*   **China Banking Corporation and Winifrida Sison:** Liability hinges on the Bank Secrecy Law exception for a court order to disclose the time deposit accounts.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Claim:** Petitioners permanently lose the opportunity to recover the alleged share of the time deposit accounts. The dismissal, if affirmed, is likely with prejudice.
*   **Liability for Damages:** The counterclaim of Respondent Sison remains pending and could result in a judgment for damages against Petitioners.
*   **Risk of Appeal:** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' decisions. Further appeals are unlikely to succeed.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Olave v. Mistas***:  Cited by the CA to support the dismissal, emphasizing the plaintiff's duty to promptly set a case for pre-trial.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rules of Court, Rule 17, Section 3 (Dismissal due to Plaintiff's failure to prosecute)
*   Rules of Court, Rule 18, Section 1 (Pre-Trial)
*   A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC (Guidelines for Pre-Trial) - deemed inapplicable in this case.
*   Bank Secrecy Law (potentially relevant to the bank's refusal to disclose account information).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Cautionary Answer":**  The court's determination that this constituted the "last pleading" is a key point.  Whether it effectively served as an answer triggering the pre-trial duty could be debated, but the court's interpretation prevailed.
*   **"Supplemental Answer" Expectation:**  Petitioners' argument that they were awaiting the filing of a supplemental answer is contentious and ultimately rejected by the courts.
*   **Lack of Prejudice to Respondents:**  Petitioners argument that the delay did not prejudice the respondents and that the court must consider the merits of the case was dismissed. The Court held that the failure to prosecute is grounds for dismissal, regardless of any actual prejudice to the Respondents.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal based on Petitioners' failure to diligently prosecute the case by not timely setting it for pre-trial after the filing of the "Cautionary Answer". The key takeaway is the plaintiff's non-delegable duty to move the case forward, regardless of pending motions or anticipated filings by the opposing party.
