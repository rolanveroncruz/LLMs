**Case Summary: *Victor Africa v. Sandiganbayan, et al.* (G.R. No. 124478, March 11, 1998)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 seeking to annul Sandiganbayan resolutions dismissing Civil Case No. 0146.

**Facts:**

*   PCGG sequestered ETPI shares in 1986.  Sequestration was later lifted on 40% of the capital stock (Class "B" shares) owned by Cable and Wireless, Ltd.  It remained in force on 60% of the capital stock (Class "A" shares).
*   Civil Case No. 0009 was filed with the Sandiganbayan for reconveyance, reversion, accounting, and restitution of alleged ill-gotten ETPI shares.
*   After a stockholders meeting, Victor Africa was ousted from his positions within ETPI, leading to G.R. No. 83831, which was referred to the Sandiganbayan and consolidated as Civil Case No. 0146. Africa sought to enjoin PCGG nominees from ousting him.
*   Sandiganbayan initially granted Africa's motion for production of documents but later dismissed Civil Case No. 0146, prompting this petition.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Injunction:** The main issue was whether the Sandiganbayan erred in dismissing Africa's petition for injunction as moot, given his ouster had already occurred.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction over private respondents Mabanta and De los Angeles was challenged, considering their positions as nominees of Cable and Wireless, Ltd., whose shares were no longer sequestered.
*   **Propriety of Remedy:** The Supreme Court questioned Africa's use of Certiorari (Rule 65) instead of a Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45) as the proper mode of appeal from a final order of the Sandiganbayan under P.D. No. 1606, as amended by R.A. No. 7975.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, affirming the Sandiganbayan's resolutions.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Improper Remedy:** The court stated that under Section 7 of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by Section 3 of R.A. No. 7975, the proper remedy was a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.
2.  **Mootness:**  The petition for injunction was moot as the act sought to be enjoined (Africa's ouster) had already been consummated.
3.  **Lack of Jurisdiction:** The Sandiganbayan lacked jurisdiction over Mabanta and De los Angeles because their shares were no longer subject to sequestration (Class "B" shares owned by Cable and Wireless, Ltd). The court referenced *PCGG v. Peña* (159 SCRA 556 [1988]) and *San Miguel Corporation v. Khan* (176 SCRA 447 [1989]).
4.  **Scope of Dismissal:** The dismissal was appropriate for all respondents because the petition was solely for the prevention of Africa's ouster by the respondents as a board.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Africa's Liability:** Africa is liable for costs.
*   **Risk:**  The case highlights the risk of seeking injunctive relief after the act sought to be enjoined has already occurred.
*   **Jurisdictional Risk:**  This case reinforces the jurisdictional limits of the Sandiganbayan to cases involving ill-gotten wealth and sequestered assets.

**Statutory References:**

*   Executive Order No. 1 (Creating the PCGG)
*   Presidential Decree No. 1606 (Sandiganbayan Law)
*   Republic Act No. 7975 (Amending P.D. No. 1606)
*   Rules of Court (Rules 45 and 65)

**Case Law References:**

*   *Africa v. PCGG* (205 SCRA 38 [1992])
*   *PCGG v. Peña* (159 SCRA 556 [1988])
*   *San Miguel Corporation v. Khan* (176 SCRA 447 [1989])

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   None explicitly highlighted; however, the procedural misstep regarding the mode of appeal and the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction were contentious points.
