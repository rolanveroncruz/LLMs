## Legal Document Summary: Davao Gulf Lumber Corporation vs. CIR and CA

**Case:** Davao Gulf Lumber Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue and Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 117359, July 23, 1998.

**Nature:** Petition for review assailing the CA decision affirming the CTA decision regarding a claim for refund of specific taxes.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 1435, Section 5:** Grants a 25% refund of specific taxes paid on manufactured oils used by miners and forest concessionaires, subject to proof of actual use. This provision intended to provide relief to entities whose vehicles did not benefit directly from the Highway Special Fund.
*   **NIRC Sections 153 and 156:** Imposed specific taxes on manufactured oils and fuels (amended over time). The petitioner seeks a refund based on the rates set by these sections, as amended during the period of purchase.
*   **Obligation to Prove Actual Use:** Petitioner must submit proof of actual use of the oils in its forest concession to qualify for the refund.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Strict Construction of Tax Exemptions:** The Court reiterates the principle that tax exemptions (including partial refunds) are construed *strictissimi juris* against the grantee (Davao Gulf Lumber) and liberally in favor of the government.
*   **Limitation of Refund Amount:** The core issue is whether the refund is calculated based on the *actual* specific taxes paid under the amended NIRC (Sections 153 and 156), or the amounts "deemed paid" under Sections 1 and 2 of RA 1435 (which prescribed lower rates).
*   **Basis for Computation:** The Court sides with the CIR, holding that the refund under Section 5 of RA 1435 should be computed based on the lower rates specified in Sections 1 and 2 of RA 1435, *not* the higher rates later imposed by the NIRC.
*   **Prescription:** Claims for refund must be filed within the prescribed period.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 1435:** The central statute granting the refund privilege.
*   **NIRC Sections 153 and 156:** Defined specific tax rates during the relevant period; however, the court ruled that this was not a proper basis for refund.
*   **Insular Lumber Co. vs. Court of Tax Appeals (104 SCRA 710):** Distinguished; the case addressed a claim for refund based on taxes paid in 1963 before the tax rates were modified. This case discusses procedure for claiming refund not the tax rates applicable.
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Rio Tuba Nickel Mining Corporation (207 SCRA 549):** Controlling doctrine, holding that refunds under RA 1435 are based on the amounts "deemed paid" under Sections 1 and 2 of that Act. This case is the source for determining the tax rates.
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Court of Appeals and Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation (232 SCRA 321):** Affirmed that Atlas was only entitled to refunds based on sections 1 and 2 of RA 1435

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity arises from Section 5 of RA 1435. The taxpayer argued that the phrase “twenty-five per centum of the specific tax paid thereon shall be refunded” is clear and unambiguous, referring to the actual tax paid. The Court rejects this argument, construing the statute against the taxpayer and finding no explicit legislative intent to base the refund on the higher rates under the NIRC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Petitioner (Davao Gulf Lumber) faces the risk of receiving a significantly lower refund amount than claimed.
*   The ruling reinforces the principle of strict construction against tax exemptions, making it harder for taxpayers to claim such benefits.
*   The case clarifies that subsequent amendments to tax rates do not automatically entitle refund claimants under RA 1435 to higher refund amounts.
