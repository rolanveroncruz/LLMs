**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Salvador Dumlao for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) â€“ illegal sale of dangerous drugs. The Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, which affirmed the trial court's finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Dumlao was sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Violation:** Illegal sale of 0.07 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride ("shabu").
*   **R.A. 9165, Section 5:** Prohibits the unauthorized sale, trading, etc., of dangerous drugs, prescribing penalties of life imprisonment to death and fines ranging from P500,000 to P10,000,000.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The prosecution must establish (1) the identity of the buyer, seller, object, and consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment. *See People v. Villanueva, G.R. No. 172116, October 30, 2006, 506 SCRA 280, 287*.
*   **Consummation:** The crime is consummated upon delivery of the drugs to the buyer. *See People v. Bandang, G.R. No. 151314, June 3, 2004, 430 SCRA 570, 579*.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Life imprisonment.
*   **Financial Liability:** Fine of P500,000.
*   **Costs:** Payment of court costs.

**Potential Risks & Issues:**

*   **Defense of Denial:** The appellant relied on a defense of denial, which the Court considered self-serving and insufficient to overcome the positive identification by prosecution witnesses.
*   **Minor Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The appellant pointed to inconsistencies in the police officer's testimony, but the court dismissed these as minor and not affecting the substance of the testimony.
*   **Lack of Documentary Evidence:** The non-presentation of pre-operation and post-operation reports was raised, but the Court held these were not indispensable elements to prove the illegal sale and did not invalidate the buy-bust operation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Section 5 (illegal sale).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The defense's challenges centered on the credibility of the buy-bust operation, citing procedural lapses (non-presentation of reports) and inconsistencies in the arresting officer's testimony. However, the court found these arguments unpersuasive.

**Overall Assessment:**

The court heavily relies on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties by law enforcement and the positive identification of the accused by the police officer involved in the buy-bust operation. The defense failed to raise sufficient doubt to overcome the prosecution's evidence.
