## Legal Document Summary: People v. Cervantes, G.R. No. 181494 (2009)

This is a Philippine Supreme Court decision acquitting Monalyn Cervantes of violating Section 15, Article III of RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, as amended) due to reasonable doubt. The case revolves around a buy-bust operation where Cervantes was allegedly involved in selling *shabu* (methamphetamine hydrochloride).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Sec. 15, Art. III of RA 6425 (selling or distributing a regulated drug).
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** Cervantes allegedly participated in a transaction to sell *shabu* to poseur-buyers for Php 500,000.
*   **Evidence:** Testimony of PO3 Ramos (poseur-buyer), forensic chemist's report (identifying the substance as *shabu*), seized drugs.
*   **Chain of Custody Issues:**  Significant lapses in the chain of custody of the seized drugs, particularly in the handling, storage, and transfer of the evidence between seizure and laboratory analysis.
*   **Forensic Chemist Testimony:** The forensic chemist who initially analyzed the drug (C/I Geronimo) did not testify; another inspector (Tria) testified in her place, raising questions of admissibility and competency regarding the drug's identification.
*   **RTC Decision:** Convicted Cervantes, acquitted co-accused Del Monte and Requiz.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC decision.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Reversed the CA decision, acquitting Cervantes.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Obligation:** The prosecution has the burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, including establishing the identity of the buyer, seller, the object of the sale (the drug), and the consideration. Crucially, the prosecution must demonstrate an unbroken chain of custody to ensure the integrity of the seized drug.
*   **Police Obligations (as per RA 9165):** Immediately after seizure, law enforcement is obligated to physically inventory and photograph the drug in the presence of the accused, representatives from the media, the DOJ, and an elected public official.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody Breakdown:** The most significant risk for the prosecution was the flawed chain of custody. The Court found a lack of documentation and testimony regarding the handling of the evidence after seizure. This created doubt as to whether the substance tested was the same one seized from the defendant, calling into question the integrity of the evidence. The absence of testimony and documentation on the transfer of the drug, including the unnamed person who delivered it and its recipient were problematic.
*   **Competency of Forensic Chemist Testimony:** The testimony of Inspector Tria regarding C/I Geronimo's report was deemed insufficient to establish the identification of the drug and compliance with the chain of custody.
*   **Inconsistent Verdicts:** The acquittal of Del Monte, who physically held the bag, while Cervantes was convicted, raised questions of equal treatment and the reliability of PO3 Ramos' testimony. The rationale for the disparate treatment was unclear, as the evidence against both was primarily based on PO3 Ramos's testimony.
*   **Presumption of Regularity vs. Presumption of Innocence:** The Court emphasized that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties does not outweigh the presumption of innocence and the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, as amended):** The law under which Cervantes was charged.
*   **Sec. 15, Art. III of RA 6425:** Selling or distributing a regulated drug.
*   **RA 9165:** Referenced regarding the inventory and photograph of drugs as part of the procedure, as well as reference to Sec. 21(1), Art. II of RA 9165.
*   **Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002:** Defines "chain of custody."
*   **People v. Malillin, G.R. No. 172953 (2008):** Emphasizes the importance of chain of custody in drug cases, especially when the evidence is not distinctive and susceptible to alteration. Sets a more stringent standard for authenticating narcotics due to their susceptibility to tampering.
*   **People v. Sanchez, G.R. No. 175832 (2008):** Highlights the non-fatality of non-compliance to police procedures of the Dangerous Drug Act, as amended.
*   **People v. Bandang, G.R. No. 151314 (2004):** Discusses the presumption of regularity in the performance of duties of a forensic chemist and the admissibility of official records. Distinguished by the court in the present case.
*   **People v. Ong, G.R. No. 137348 (2004):** Emphasizes the importance of the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt of appellants' guilt.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court acquitted Cervantes because the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs. The failure to present the initial forensic chemist, coupled with the lapses in documenting the handling and transfer of the evidence, created a reasonable doubt as to whether the substance tested was the same one seized. This reinforces the necessity of strict compliance with chain of custody procedures in drug cases to ensure the integrity of the evidence and protect the rights of the accused. The Court emphasizes that the prosecution has not proven that the substance seized was the same substance adduced in court as an element of *corpus delicti*.
