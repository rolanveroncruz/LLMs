**Legal Document Summary: *Materrco, Inc. vs. First Landlink Asia Development Corporation*, G.R. No. 175687 (2008)**

**Subject:** Motion for Reconsideration regarding the applicable filing fees for an ejectment case filed in 1996.

**Key Issue:** Determination of the correct filing fee for an ejectment case under Rule 141, Section 8, as amended by Administrative Circular No. 11-94 (A.C. No. 11-94), effective June 28, 1994.

**Court's Holding:** The Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED. The Court affirms its previous ruling, interpreting Section 8(b)(4) of A.C. No. 11-94 as a catch-all provision applicable to ejectment cases, prescribing a filing fee of P150.  Even if this weren't the case, the prior fee of P100 for ejectment cases would apply because the graduated fees were not applicable.

**Key Provisions and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 141, Section 8, Rules of Court (pre- and post-amendment by A.C. No. 11-94):** Dictates the legal fees payable to Clerks of Metropolitan and Municipal Trial Courts.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 11-94:** Amended Rule 141, Section 8. The core issue revolves around the proper interpretation of this amendment.
*   **Section 8(a) of Rule 141 (as amended):** Establishes a graduated fee schedule based on the value of the subject matter. Materrco argued this should apply to ejectment cases.
*   **Section 8(b)(4) of Rule 141 (as amended):** Sets a flat fee of P150 for "each proceeding other than allowance of wills (probate), granting of letter of administration, settlement of estates of small value..." The Court interprets this to include ejectment cases.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980), Section 33(2):** Defines the jurisdiction of Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts over ejectment cases.
*   **Republic Act No. 7691:** Expanded the jurisdiction of lower courts, prompting the issuance of A.C. No. 11-94.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The core obligation in dispute is the payment of the correct legal filing fee. Materrco argued that First Landlink underpaid, potentially affecting jurisdiction.
*   Liability: Impliedly, if Materrco's interpretation of the filing fee rules were correct, First Landlink would be liable for the deficiency.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of Section 8(b)(4):** The scope of the phrase "each proceeding other than..." is the central point of contention. The lack of explicit mention of ejectment cases creates ambiguity.
*   **Risk of jurisdictional challenge:** If the filing fee was indeed deficient, the court's jurisdiction over the ejectment case could be challenged.

**Case Law Relevance:**

*   The interpretation of A.C. No. 11-94 is critical. The Court considered the intent behind the amendment (due to R.A. 7691) and sought to avoid an "absurd consequence" of eliminating fees for appeals and marriage ceremonies.
*   The ruling sets a precedent for interpreting similar ambiguities in legal fee schedules, emphasizing a broad, practical approach.

**Concise Assessment:** The Supreme Court rejected a narrow, literal reading of A.C. No. 11-94, opting for a purposive interpretation that maintains the established legal fee structure for ejectment cases. The decision highlights the importance of considering the legislative intent and avoiding unintended consequences when interpreting amendments to procedural rules.
