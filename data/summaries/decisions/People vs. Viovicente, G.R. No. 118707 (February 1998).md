**Case Summary: People v. Viovicente, G.R. No. 118707 (1998)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a conviction of Murder certified to the Supreme Court due to the Court of Appeals' modification of the penalty.

**Facts:** Fernando Viovicente was convicted of murder for the stabbing death of Fernando Hoyohoy. The prosecution presented an eyewitness, Fernando Flores, who testified Viovicente held the victim while two others stabbed him. The victim's brother, Tomas, testified that the victim identified Viovicente as one of his assailants in an ante-mortem statement. The accused presented alibi as a defense.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for murder, modifying the penalty to reclusion perpetua and increasing damages.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Liability:** Viovicente is criminally liable for murder under the Revised Penal Code. He is also civilly liable to the victim's heirs for damages.
*   **Penalty:** Sentenced to reclusion perpetua.
*   **Damages:** Required to pay:
    *   P9,000.00 actual damages (burial expenses)
    *   P50,000.00 moral damages
    *   P50,000.00 civil indemnity

**Key Evidence & Case Law:**

*   **Eyewitness Testimony (Fernando Flores):** Crucial in identifying the accused and establishing conspiracy. Positive identification prevails over alibi (citing *People v. Obzunar, 265 SCRA 547 (1996)*). Credibility of witnesses is given great respect unless there is an error (citing *People v. Apongan, G.R. No. 112369, April 4, 1997*).
*   **Ante-Mortem Statement (to Tomas Hoyohoy):** Admissible as a dying declaration under Rule 130, ยง37 of the Rules on Evidence. The court emphasizes that a dying declaration need not be in writing. Requirements: concerns declarant's death, consciousness of impending death, declarant's competency, offered in a homicide/murder/parricide case where declarant is victim (citing *People v. Garma, G.R. No. 110872, April 18, 1997*).
*   **Alibi:** Rejected due to positive identification by the eyewitness and inconsistencies in the testimonies of the accused and his mother. Alibi cannot prevail against positive identification.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Discrepancy in victim's statements:** The victim's initial statement to police (Cpl. Combalicer) only named "Maning" as the assailant, creating a conflict with the later ante-mortem statement to his brother. The Court dismisses this by prioritizing the eyewitness account and implicitly discounting the police statement.
*   **Delayed Reporting of Ante-Mortem Statement:** The defense argued that the delay in reporting the ante-mortem statement to the police (until after the accused was arrested) should render it suspect. The court allows the explanation that the family thought matter was under investigation.
*   **Conspiracy:** The conviction hinges on the finding of conspiracy. The evidence shows Viovicente holding the victim. The Court does not explicitly discuss the legal elements required to prove conspiracy.
*   **Sentencing Discrepancy:** The Court of Appeals corrected the trial court's erroneous imposition of an indeterminate sentence, which was inconsistent with the finding of murder and the absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (Murder)
*   Rules of Evidence, Rule 130, ยง37 (Dying Declaration)
*   Rules of Court, Rule 124, ยง13 (Certification to Supreme Court)
