Here's a concise legal summary of the *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Gallego* case:

**Case:** *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Manuel O. Gallego, Jr., et al.*, G.R. No. 173226, January 20, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision modifying the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) just compensation award for land expropriated under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).

**Facts:** Respondents owned agricultural land expropriated by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) under P.D. No. 27 (later covered by R.A. No. 6657).  Disagreement arose regarding just compensation. The RTC fixed compensation based on P.D. No. 27 formula using a higher Average Gross Production and Government Support Price than Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) claimed was correct. The CA modified the award, using current market value. LBP appealed.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Just Compensation:** The central issue is the determination of just compensation for land expropriated under P.D. No. 27 but where the process was incomplete before the enactment of R.A. No. 6657.
*   **Applicable Law:**  Whether P.D. No. 27/E.O. No. 228 or R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law) applies. The Court clarified that R.A. 6657 applies retroactively, with P.D. 27 and E.O. 228 having suppletory effect, relying on *Paris v. Alfeche* and *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals*.
*   **Valuation Formula:** Whether the trial court can use current market value without considering DAR's (Department of Agrarian Reform) formula and the Government Support Price at the time of taking.
*   **DAR Administrative Orders:** Applicable DAR A.O. No. 5, Series of 1998, requiring Capitalized Net Income, Comparable Sales, and Market Value, should be the basis for compensation calculation but needs to be formally presented as evidence, referencing *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada*.
*   **Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657:** Provides factors for determining just compensation: acquisition cost, current value of like properties, nature, actual use and income, sworn valuation by owner, tax declarations, and government assessments.
*   **Interest:** CA correctly rejected the RTC's imposition of "interest in kind" under Article 1958 of the Civil Code, as that article applies to mutuum loans, not expropriation.
*   **Execution Pending Appeal:** The Court allowed immediate execution of the CA's award despite the pending appeal based on humanitarian reasons due to the respondent's age, health, and the long pendency of the case (*Borja v. Court of Appeals* cited).

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA's and RTC's decisions and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals with direction to act as agent of the Supreme Court:
1. To receive evidence and determine the just compensation based on R.A. No. 6657, Sec. 17; DAR A.O. No. 5, Series of 1998; and prevailing jurisprudence.
2. To submit its findings and recommendations to the Supreme Court within 45 days.
3. Ordered the LBP to immediately pay the respondents the amount of P30,711,600.00 awarded by the Court of Appeals, less whatever amounts they have been paid thus far.

**Obligations:**

*   **LBP:** Obligated to pay just compensation as determined by the CA, acting under the instructions of the SC, following DAR A.O. No. 5 and R.A. 6657, Section 17 and to immediately pay P30,711,600.00, less previous payments.
*   **DAR:** Implicitly obligated to ensure proper implementation of CARP and to provide accurate data for just compensation calculations.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Valuation Disputes:** Determining the "current value of like properties" and other factors under Section 17 of R.A. 6657 can be contentious. The appraisal and reception of evidence will be contested.
*   **DAR A.O. No. 5:** Applying DAR A.O. No. 5 requires reliable data on Capitalized Net Income, Comparable Sales, and Market Value, which may be difficult to ascertain and subject to challenge.
*   **Delays:** Despite the remand to the CA for expedited proceedings, further delays are possible in evidence gathering and valuation.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Paris v. Alfeche*
*   *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals*
*   *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada*
*   *Borja v. Court of Appeals*

**Statutory References:**

*   P.D. No. 27
*   E.O. No. 228
*   R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law)
*   DAR A.O. No. 5, Series of 1998
*   Civil Code, Article 1958

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The term "current value of like properties" under Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 is subject to interpretation and could lead to valuation disputes.
*   The mandate to use DAR A.O. No. 5 implies the necessity of providing fair and competitive pricing that reflects market value that will compensate the landowners fairly and justly.
