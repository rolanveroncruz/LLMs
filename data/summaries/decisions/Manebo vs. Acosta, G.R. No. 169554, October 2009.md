**Case Summary: *Nieva M. Manebo v. SPO1 Roel D. Acosta and Numeriano Sapiandante***

**Citation:** 619 Phil. 614 (G.R. No. 169554, October 28, 2009)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision which affirmed the Office of the President's (OP) affirmance of the Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary's resolution directing the withdrawal of the Information for Murder against respondents.

**Facts:**

*   Victim, Bernadette M. Dimatulac, was shot and killed.
*   Witnesses identified SPO1 Roel D. Acosta as the shooter and Numeriano Sapiandante as the driver of the getaway vehicle.
*   A murder complaint was filed against Acosta, Sapiandante, and a "John Doe".
*   The State Prosecutor recommended filing an Information for Murder against respondents; however, the DOJ Secretary reversed the appealed resolution.
*   The Office of the President (OP) affirmed the resolution of the DOJ Secretary.
*   Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed the appeal of Manebo.
*   Petitioner (sister of the victim) argues that the CA, OP, and DOJ Secretary committed grave errors in dismissing the complaint.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Determination of Probable Cause:** The core issue is whether there is probable cause to indict Acosta and Sapiandante for murder.
*   **DOJ Circular No. 70 (2000 NPS Rule on Appeal):** Petitioner argued that the respondents failed to comply with Sections 5 and 6 of this circular, specifically regarding the submission of a motion to defer proceedings. However, the court found that the respondents did substantially comply with the rules and the complaint was dismissed.

**Liabilities:**

*   If probable cause exists, Acosta and Sapiandante are liable for murder under the Revised Penal Code.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Witness Credibility:** The DOJ Secretary questioned the credibility of key witnesses (Bagasan and Sardia) due to inconsistencies and delayed reporting, leading to the initial reversal of the prosecutor's recommendation.
*   **Inconsistencies in Initial Police Report:** The initial police report identified the witness as "Liza Gragasan," while the affiant was "Flordeliza Bagasan," raising questions about the witness's presence at the scene.  The Supreme Court resolved this inconsistency by using the rule of *Idem Sonans*, determining that Liza and Flordeliza and Gragasan and Bagasan sounded similar.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** The DOJ questioned the delayed execution of Sardia's affidavit, but the Supreme Court attributed this delay to the witnesses being reluctant to volunteer information or get involved in a criminal case.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (Murder)**
*   **Department Circular No. 70 (2000 NPS Rule on Appeal):** Failure to comply with the requirements of Sections 5 and 6 of the rules shall constitute sufficient ground for the dismissal of the petition.
*   **Probable Cause Standards:** Case law defining probable cause, emphasizing that it need not be based on clear and convincing evidence but on reasonable belief.  *Chan v. Secretary of Justice* (G.R. No. 147065, March 14, 2008, 548 SCRA 337, 352).
*   ***Idem Sonans*** The legal principle where minor differences in names do not invalidate a document if the names sound the same when pronounced, preserving legal intent. *People v. Salas, G.R. No. 115192, March 7, 2000, 327 SCRA 319, 333, citing Martin v. State, 541 S.W. 2d 605, 606.*
*   **Preliminary Investigation:**  Preliminary Investigation constitutes a realistic judicial appraisal of the merits of a case and determines which person or persons may be reasonably charged with a crime. *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Hon. Secretary of Justice Raul M. Gonzales, Oliver T. Yao and Diana T. Yao, G.R. No. 180165, April 7, 2009.*

**Holding/Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition and **REVERSED** the CA decision. The Court found that the DOJ committed a manifest error in finding no probable cause. The DOJ Secretary was ordered to direct the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila to withdraw the Motion to Withdraw the Information for Murder already filed in the trial court. The Court emphasized that inconsistencies in the initial police report did not invalidate the witness testimony and that the delay in reporting the crime could be explained by fear and reluctance to get involved. The Court gave more weight to the positive identification of the respondents by witnesses and the corroborating circumstances.

**Actionable Items/Recommendations:**

*   Proceed with the prosecution of Acosta and Sapiandante for murder, as the Supreme Court found probable cause exists based on the evidence presented.
*   Prepare for a full trial, focusing on reinforcing the credibility of the eyewitnesses and addressing any inconsistencies or challenges to their testimonies.
*   Anticipate defenses based on alibi and potential attacks on the witnesses' motives and credibility.
