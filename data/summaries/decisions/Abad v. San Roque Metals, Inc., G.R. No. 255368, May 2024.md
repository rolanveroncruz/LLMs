**Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 255368**

**Case:** *Leo A. Abad, et al. vs. San Roque Metals, Inc.*

**Court:** Supreme Court, Second Division

**Decision Date:** May 29, 2024

**Subject Matter:**  Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding the validity of compromise agreements in an illegal dismissal case.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Initial ELA Decision:** Declared illegal dismissal by Prudential Customs Brokerage Services, Inc. (PCBSI) and San Roque Metals, Inc. (SRMI), holding them solidarily liable for backwages and separation pay.
*   **Final Judgment:** The ELA decision was affirmed through the CA, and the SC denied review.
*   **Compromise Agreements:** Twelve employees (Petitioners) entered into individual compromise agreements with PCBSI and SRMI, receiving settlement amounts and employment with SRMI, stated to be "full, complete, and final satisfaction" of claims.
*   **ELA Order (Post-Compromise):**  Executive Labor Arbiter (ELA) ruled the compromise agreements were merely "advances" and not full payments, relying on a handwritten notation stating "without prejudice to the outcome of the pre-execution conference/proceedings," and issued a writ of execution for a larger amount.
*   **NLRC Ruling:** Upheld the ELA, invalidating the compromise agreements because of unconscionably low consideration and ambiguity created by the ELA's note.
*   **CA Ruling (Overturned by SC):**  Partially granted SRMI's petition, validating the compromise agreements as full payment and deleting awards of backwages and separation pay to petitioning employees.

**Liabilities:**

*   **SRMI & PCBSI:** Initially held solidarily liable for backwages and separation pay, but the CA ruling reversed this, finding the compromise agreements to release them. SC reverses the CA and holds them solidarily liable based on the affirmed ELA decision.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Validity of Compromise Agreements:** The central dispute revolves around whether the compromise agreements constitute a full and final settlement of the employees' claims, given the comparatively low consideration in relation to the judgment.
*   **Solidary Liability of SRMI:** SRMI argued it should not be held solidarily liable, especially for punitive damages like backwages and separation pay, absent evidence of conspiracy in the illegal dismissal, citing jurisprudence. This argument was rejected due to the finality of the earlier judgment on the issue.
*   **ELA's Note:** The legal effect of the ELA's handwritten note on the compromise agreements ("without prejudice...") is contentious.  SRMI argued it lacked legal effect because it was not signed by the parties. SC's final order did not touch on the ELA's note, but focused on the unconscionable consideration of the compromise agreements.
*   **Reasonableness of Consideration:** The settlement amounts, ranging from 5.20% to 23.42% of the final monetary awards, are challenged as unconscionably low, rendering the quitclaims invalid. The SC ultimately agrees with the NLRC and sides with the employees in this matter.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Quitclaims:** The court emphasizes that quitclaims are generally frowned upon as contrary to public policy.
*   **Validity of Quitclaims:**  The court reiterates the requirements for a valid quitclaim: voluntary execution, no fraud or deceit, credible and reasonable consideration, and compliance with law and public policy. *Inter-Orient Maritime Incorporated v. Candava, 712 Phil. 628 (2013)*
*   **Substantial Evidence:**  The Court references that the NLRC is to make decisions based on "substantial evidence."
*   **Reasonableness of Consideration in Compromise Agreements** While there is no standard formula to define reasonableness in compromise agreements, *Cadalin vs. CA, 593 Phil. 170 (2008)*, *Galicia vs. NLRC, 342 Phil. 342 (1997)*, *Castillon vs. Magsaysay Mitsui Osk Marine, Inc., 872 Phil. 92 (2020)* and *R&E Transport vs. Latag, 467 Phil. 355 (2004)*, the Supreme Court has held varying percentages to be unreasonable on a case-to-case basis.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the Petition and REVERSED the CA ruling, thereby AFFIRMING the NLRC Resolutions that invalidated the compromise agreements. SRMI remains solidarily liable with PCBSI for the full monetary awards due to the Petitioners, minus amounts already received, plus legal interest from the finality of the decision. This decision hinges on the finding that the consideration for the compromise agreements was unconscionably low.
