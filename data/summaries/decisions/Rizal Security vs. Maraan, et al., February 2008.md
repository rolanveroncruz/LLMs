## Legal Document Summary: Rizal Security vs. Maraan

**Document:** G.R. No. 124915, February 18, 2008 (569 Phil. 355) - Rizal Security & Protective Services Inc. vs. Hon. Director Alex E. Maraan, et al.

**Nature:** Decision on a Petition for Certiorari challenging an Order of the DOLE-CAR Regional Director.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Initial Complaint:** Private respondents (security guards) filed a complaint with DOLE-CAR alleging violations of labor standards (illegal deductions, underpayment of wages, nonpayment of overtime, holiday pay, and 13th-month pay).
*   **DOLE Inspection:** DOLE inspection found violations, including underpayment of wages, COLA, overtime pay, service incentive leave, night-shift differential, frequency of payment, nonpayment of 13th-month pay, and lack of emergency medicines.
*   **Resignation & Termination:** Security guards resigned. Rainbow End Village terminated its security contract with Rizal Security, both effective September 1, 1995.
*   **DOLE Order (Jan 24, 1996):** DOLE-CAR denied Rizal Security's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, ordering payment of P560,989.70 to the security guards and held Resident Manager of Rainbow End Village jointly and severally liable.
*   **Writ of Execution (March 12, 1996):** DOLE-CAR issued a writ of execution to enforce the Order.
*   **Petition for Certiorari:** Rizal Security filed this petition arguing lack of jurisdiction, premature issuance of the writ of execution, and improper finding of personal liability against Rufino Antonio.

**Obligations:**

*   **Rizal Security:** Alleged obligation to pay back wages, COLA, overtime pay, service incentive leave, night-shift differential, and 13th-month pay to former employees.
*   **Dominador Valmonte (Rainbow End Village):** Joint and several liability with Rizal Security for the deficiencies.

**Liabilities:**

*   Rizal Security faces monetary liability for labor standards violations. The amount is P560,989.70.
*   Potential for liability of Rufino S. Antonio Jr., as president of Rizal Security. The initial DOLE order held him jointly and severally liable, but this issue remains unresolved in this particular decision.
*   Dominador Valmonte faces potential joint and several liability.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdictional Challenge:** Rizal Security argued that the DOLE-CAR lost jurisdiction after the employees resigned, claiming the case should have been transferred to the NLRC. Court rejected that argument, citing that jurisdiction is determined at the time of the filing of the original complaint.
*   **Premature Execution:** The court found that the Writ of Execution was issued prematurely because Rizal Security's counsel never received an official copy of the January 24, 1996 Order. This lack of notice violated due process and prevented Rizal Security from filing a motion for reconsideration, delaying its finality.
*   **Joint & Several Liability:** The personal liability of Rufino S. Antonio Jr. remained an open question in this particular decision, pending further action by the DOLE-CAR after proper notice and opportunity to exhaust administrative remedies.
*   **Articles 107 and 109 of the Labor Code:** the case refers to these articles regarding joint and several liability, and the order by DOLE relies upon them.
*   **Art. 128 of the Labor Code:** This article vests the Secretary of Labor and Employment or their authorized representatives with visitorial and enforcement powers, including the authority to issue compliance orders based on labor standards violations.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 128 of the Labor Code:** Grants DOLE visitorial and enforcement powers.
*   **Articles 107 and 109 of the Labor Code:** These articles dictate potential joint and several liability in this context.
*   **Rule II, Section 3 of the Rules on the Disposition of Labor Standards Cases in the Regional Offices:** Pertains to jurisdiction when employer-employee relationship no longer exists.
*   **Rule II, Section 4 of the Rules on the Disposition of Labor Standards Cases in the Regional Offices:** Addresses the process for the service of orders and notices, emphasizing service to counsel of record.
*   **Rule III, Section 17 of the Rules on the Disposition of Labor Standards Cases in the Regional Offices:** Sets the timeline for motion for reconsideration of the Regional Office order
*   **Jurisdiction over the subject matter:** Defined by allegations in the complaint at filing. Encarnacion v. Amigo, G.R. No. 169793, 15 September 2006, 502 SCRA 172, 178
*   **Certiorari:** Limited to jurisdictional issues and grave abuse of discretion.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court PARTIALLY GRANTED the petition, quashing the Writ of Execution dated March 12, 1996, due to premature issuance. The DOLE-CAR was directed to proceed with CAR00-9507-CI-25 with dispatch, ensuring proper notice to Rizal Security.

**Next Steps:**

The DOLE-CAR must reissue its Order after ensuring proper service of the Order to Rizal Security's counsel. Once properly served, Rizal Security will have the opportunity to file a Motion for Reconsideration. The issue of Antonio's personal liability will then need to be addressed in the administrative process. Counsel should monitor the proceedings closely to protect Rizal Security's interests and preserve appellate options. Counsel should revisit the Articles 107 and 109, as well as the records of the DOLE inspection and internal processes, to confirm the accuracy of the DOL-CAR's re-evaluated order, and defend the client accordingly.
