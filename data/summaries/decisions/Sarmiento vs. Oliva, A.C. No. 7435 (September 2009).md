Okay, here is a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Rey C. Sarmiento, et al. v. Atty. Edelson G. Oliva*, A.C. No. 7435, September 10, 2009 (615 Phil. 79)

**Nature:** Disbarment complaint (later modified).

**Facts:**

*   Complainants (Sarmientos) sold a property to Respondent (Oliva), receiving postdated checks as payment.
*   Initial checks were dishonored due to "closed account."
*   Respondent requested a reduction of the obligation, complainants agreed to a reduced amount of P11 million.
*   Respondent made a partial payment of P200,000 and issued new checks, one of which was also dishonored due to "closed account."
*   Complainants filed a disbarment complaint with the IBP.
*   Respondent claimed the checks were conditional on a third-party buyer's loan approval and that the deposit violated their agreement.
*   Respondent failed to attend IBP hearings and was deemed to have waived his right to participate.
*   The IBP CBD recommended a two-year suspension and restitution of P11 million.
*   The IBP Board of Governors approved the CBD recommendation.
*   The Supreme Court discovered that the Respondent had already been disbarred in a previous case, *Libit v. Attys. Edelson G. Oliva and Umali*, A.C. No. 2837, 237 SCRA 375 (1994).
*   The complainants were not aware of this disbarment, and the Respondent did not disclose it to the IBP.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Payment for Property:** The core issue is the failure of Respondent to fully pay for the property he acquired from the Complainants.
*   **Restitution:** The IBP initially ordered the Respondent to restitute P11 million to the complainants, which the Supreme Court affirmed.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Financial Liability:** Respondent is liable for the unpaid balance of P11 million.
*   **Contempt of Court:** The Supreme Court ordered Respondent to SHOW CAUSE why he should not be cited for indirect contempt of court.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Judgment:**  Complainants bear the risk of enforcement of the judgment against the Respondent for the P11 million. The decision notes this is subject to the presumption that complainants have not sought to enforce their right to collect on the amount of the check either by a criminal action for violation of BP 22 or estafa or by civil action for a sum of money.
*   **Criminal Charges:** Aside from potential contempt charges, Respondent may face criminal liability for estafa or violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law), depending on the circumstances and the actions of the Complainants.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   ***Libit v. Attys. Edelson G. Oliva and Umali***, A.C. No. 2837, 237 SCRA 375 (1994): The previous disbarment case against Respondent.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law):** Potential criminal liability for issuing dishonored checks.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 71, Section 3(e):** Basis for potential indirect contempt charge for unauthorized practice of law.
*   **Tan v. Baton, Jr., A.C. No. 6483, 31 August 2007, 531 SCUA 645:** Case law cited for the principle that a disbarred lawyer who continues to represent himself as a lawyer is liable for indirect contempt.
*   **Estafa:** Potential criminal liability.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Respondent's claim regarding conditional deposit of checks (tied to a third-party loan) is a potentially contentious issue. While the IBP dismissed this due to Respondent's failure to participate, it could be relevant in separate civil or criminal proceedings.
*   The Supreme Court's qualification on whether the Complainants had already pursued actions for BP 22 or Estafa implies a concern about double recovery.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court focused on the Respondent's deception in continuing to act as a lawyer after disbarment and his unjust enrichment from the property transaction. The case highlights the importance of candor to the court and the consequences of misrepresenting one's status as a member of the bar.
