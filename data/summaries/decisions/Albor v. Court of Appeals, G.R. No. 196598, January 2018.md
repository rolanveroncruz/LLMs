## Legal Document Summary: Albor v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 196598

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65) challenging CA Resolutions that dismissed Editha Albor's Rule 43 Petition for Review of a DARAB decision for being filed out of time.

**Facts:**

*   Editha Albor was an agricultural lessee of land owned by the heirs of Rosario Andrada.
*   The heirs sold the land to Nerva Macasil and Norma Beluso (Respondents) via an extrajudicial settlement with deed of sale.
*   Albor filed a complaint before the PARAD for redemption under Section 12 of RA 3844 (as amended by RA 6389), alleging she wasn't properly notified of the sale.
*   The PARAD dismissed the complaint because Albor did not consign the full redemption price (determined to be P600,000.00, the sale price in the deed).
*   Albor appealed to DARAB, which affirmed the PARAD decision.
*   Albor's counsel received the DARAB decision. Albor sought extensions to file a Rule 43 petition with the CA. The CA ultimately dismissed the Petition for being filed out of time.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Right of Redemption (Section 12, RA 3844 as amended by RA 6389):**  Albor's primary claim hinges on her statutory right to redeem the property within 180 days of proper written notice of the sale from the vendees, affecting all lessees and the Department of Agrarian Reform. The main debate revolves around whether she received valid written notice of the sale.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal (Rule 43, Rules of Court):** The CA dismissed Albor's Petition for Review for failure to perfect appeal within the allowed timeframe. Key issue is whether the CA abused its discretion in denying a second extension for filing the petition.
*   **Consignation of Redemption Price:** The PARAD and DARAB decisions were premised on the argument that Editha did not consign the correct redemption value (full P600,000.00). This has been supported by Quiño v. CA (353 Phil. 499, 458) which requires payment of the full redemption price.
*   **Propriety of Remedy:**  The Supreme Court highlights that Albor improperly filed a Rule 65 Petition for Certiorari instead of a Rule 45 Petition for Review on Certiorari. This procedural error is fatal to her case.

**Obligations:**

*   **Lessee (Albor):** Obligation to pay rent, comply with procedural rules for appealing decisions, and tender the full redemption price to exercise the right of redemption.
*   **Vendees (Macasil & Beluso):** Obligation to provide proper written notice of the sale to affected lessees and the Department of Agrarian Reform to trigger the redemption period.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Albor:**  Risk of losing the right to redeem the land, obligation to pay back rentals to respondents, and potentially liable for legal costs.
*   **Macasil & Beluso:** While they prevailed in this case, they faced potential liability had Albor successfully exercised her right of redemption.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Notice Requirement:** Was the notice provided to Albor by the heirs of Rosario or the respondents sufficient to comply with Section 12, RA 3844? The PARAD found it was insufficient because it did not indicate the terms and particulars of the sale.
*   **Second Extension for Filing:** The rule regarding second extensions (Rule 43, Section 4) is strictly construed. The CA did not find "compelling reasons" for a second extension based on the withdrawal of Albor's original counsel.
*   **Impact of Albor's own action:** The Court emphasized Albor's agency in causing the issue. She signed off on her previous council's withdrawal, knowing there was a need for a new council to be onboarded and familiarized with the case.
*   **"Sudden withdrawal":** The court found that the motion was done with at least 7 days remaining, and Albor failed to seek assistance of new council until one day before the expiration.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code) as amended by RA 6389:**  Governs the right of redemption for agricultural lessees.
*   **Rule 43, Rules of Court:** Governs appeals from quasi-judicial agencies to the Court of Appeals.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs appeals from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for certiorari.
*   **Quiño v. CA, 353 Phil. 499 (1998):**  Establishes the requirement of consigning the full redemption price for a valid offer to redeem.
*   **Sps. Dycoco v. Court of Appeals, 715 Phil. 550 (2013):** Similar case regarding denial of a second extension for filing a petition due to change of counsel.
*   **Cesar Naguit v. San Miguel Corp, 761 Phil. 184 (2015):** Reiterated workload and resignation as insufficient justification for procedural rules.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court dismissed Albor's petition. Procedurally, she chose the wrong mode of appeal (Rule 65 instead of Rule 45). Substantively, she failed to consign the full redemption price, and the CA did not abuse its discretion in denying a second extension for filing her Petition for Review. The case underscores the importance of adhering to procedural rules and fulfilling statutory requirements to preserve legal rights, especially in agricultural land disputes.
