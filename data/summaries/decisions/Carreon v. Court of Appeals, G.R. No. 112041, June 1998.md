**Case Summary: Carreon v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 112041 (June 22, 1998)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court ruling in an ejectment case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Ejectment:** The core issue is the right to physical possession (possession *de facto*) of the property. The court emphasizes that ejectment actions are distinct from actions concerning title/ownership (*de jure*).
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1517 (Urban Land Reform Act):**  Defines "tenant" in Section 3(f). Specifically excludes those whose presence is merely tolerated, those without a contract, those who entered by force or deceit, or those whose possession is under litigation. Also addresses "legitimate tenants" rights to first refusal to purchase land under Section 6.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 877:** Section 5(c) outlines grounds for judicial ejectment, including the owner's legitimate need to repossess the property for their own use or for immediate family member's use, provided certain conditions are met (expired lease, 3-month notice, no other residential unit owned, no lease to third parties for one year).
*   **Rule 70, Section 4, Revised Rules of Court:** Rules on evidence of title in ejectment cases.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners (Virginia Carreon, et al.):**  Ordered to vacate the property.
*   **Private Respondents (Honorio L. Carreon):** Right to repossess the property for use by immediate family member.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Petitioners:** Risk of forcible eviction. Potential liability for damages related to unlawful detainer, if any.
*   **Private Respondents:** Risk of challenges to ownership separate from the ejectment action.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Mataas na Lupa Tenants Association, Inc. vs. Carlos Dimayuga, et al., 130 SCRA 30:** Addresses rights of tenants association.
*   **Banson vs. Court of Appeals, 246 SCRA 42 (1995):** Defines occupation by mere tolerance.
*   **Reyes vs. Villaflor, 2 SCRA 247(1961):** Estoppel for tenants denying landlord's title.
*   **Del Rosario vs. Court of Appeals, 241 SCRA 519(1995):** Independence of ejectment actions from ownership claims.
*   **Asset Privatization Trust vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 103277, February 3, l994, 229 SCRA 627:** Judgments in ejectment cases do not bar action between the same parties respecting title to the land.
*   **San Pedro vs. Court of Appeals, 235 SCRA 145 (1994), Soco vs. Court of Appeals, 263 SCRA 449:** Finality of ejectment decisions not affected by pending ownership disputes.
*   **Dizon vs. Court of Appeals, 264 SCRA 391 (l996):** Certificate of title conclusive evidence of ownership in ejectment cases.
*   **Trinidad vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 204 SCRA 524:** Certificate of title cannot be subject to collateral attack.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses and Points:**

*   **"Legitimate Tenant" Status:** Petitioners claim that the respondent court erred in declaring their eviction from the disputed premises, contending that they were the actual occupants of the said property and were among those listed in the NHA census conducted thereon. This is based on their argument that they meet the criteria of "legitimate tenants" with rights under PD 1517 and PD 2016.

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 1517 (Urban Land Reform Act)
*   Presidential Decree No. 2016 (Amendment to PD 1517)
*   Batas Pambansa Blg. 877 (Rent Control Law)
*   Rule 70, Revised Rules of Court (Forcible Entry and Unlawful Detainer)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA decision ordering the petitioners to vacate the property. The court found that the petitioners were not "legitimate tenants" under P.D. 1517, as their occupancy was based on mere tolerance, not a lease agreement. Furthermore, Honorio Carreon II (respondent's son) legitimately needed the property for residential use, satisfying the conditions under B.P. 877 for judicial ejectment. The court emphasized that the central issue was possession *de facto*, not ownership, and that an ejectment action is independent of any disputes about title. The court also ruled that petitioners cannot claim protection afforded by presidential decrees 1517 and 2016 because they are not legitimate tenants or occupant families who have resided on the land for ten years or more. The Court also ruled that even if the question of ownership is raised in the pleadings the court may pass upon such issue but only to determine the question of possession especially if the former is inseparably linked with the latter and that it cannot resolve the issue of ownership.
