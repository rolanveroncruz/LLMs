## Legal Document Summary: People v. ABC260708 (G.R. No. 260708)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision

**Date:** January 23, 2024

**Subject Matter:** Proper designation of rape when elements of both statutory and qualified rape are present.

**Parties:**

*   **Plaintiff-Appellee:** People of the Philippines
*   **Accused-Appellant:** ABC260708 (father of the victim)

**Factual Background:**

ABC260708 was charged with two counts of rape against his 8-year-old daughter (AAA260708): (1) qualified rape (Criminal Case No. 17006); and (2) rape through sexual assault (Criminal Case No. 17007), under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 8353 and in relation to Section 5(b) of RA No. 7610

He was convicted by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), with the Court of Appeals (CA) affirming the conviction, but modifying the nomenclature to qualified statutory rape.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **Criminal Case No. 17006 (Qualified Rape/Qualified Statutory Rape):**

    *   **Elements:** The issue is whether the crime should be denominated as "qualified rape" or "qualified statutory rape" given that the victim was a minor (under 12 at the time of the incident), and the accused was her father (relationship as a qualifying circumstance).
    *   **The SC ruled that the proper designation is *qualified rape*, abandoning the nomenclature of 'qualified statutory rape' in this context.** It held that the minority of the victim is an inherent aggravating circumstance, while the relationship between the offender and the victim constitutes a special qualifying aggravating circumstance which elevates the crime to qualified rape, and thus, subsumes the inherent circumstance. Appreciating both would be prejudicial to the accused.
    *   **Rationale:** *Statutory Rape:* Refers to carnal knowledge with a person below the statutory age of consent, regardless of consent. *Qualified Rape:* Is simple or statutory rape attended by specific aggravating circumstances that qualify the offense. The Court noted conflicting jurisprudence on whether the additional factor of minority means the crime is “qualified statutory rape.”
    *   **Held:** Guilt affirmed. Reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole. Civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages of PHP 150,000 each were awarded.
2.  **Criminal Case No. 17007 (Rape through Sexual Assault):**

    *   **Elements:** Insertion of the accused's penis into the victim's mouth, where the victim is under 12 years old.
    *   **Held:** Guilt affirmed. Indeterminate sentence of 13 years, 9 months, and 11 days to 16 years, 5 months, and 10 days of reclusion temporal. A fine of PHP 15,000.00 was imposed, and civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages of PHP 50,000 each were awarded.
3.  **Evidentiary Issues:** The Court reiterated that a photocopy of the birth certificate can be admitted as secondary evidence of age if the original is a public record, especially if the defense does not dispute its content. The accused's admission of paternity is a judicial admission that does not need further proof.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Art. 266-A (Rape; When and How Committed); Art. 266-B (Penalties), specifically the special qualifying circumstances.
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 8353:** An Act Expanding the Definition of the Crime of Rape...
*   **Republic Act No. 7610:** Provides stronger deterrence and special protection against child abuse, exploitation, and discrimination.
*   **Republic Act No. 11648:** Increased the age for determining the commission of statutory rape from "under twelve (12) years of age" to "under sixteen (16) years of age."
*   **Revised Rules of Court:** Rule 130, Section 3(d) - Admissibility of public records. Rule 129 sec. 4 - Judicial Admissions
*   **People v. Cayabyab (503 Phil. 606):** Admissibility of a photocopy of the rape victim's birth certificate to prove her age because its original is a public record.
*   **People v. Tipay (385 Phil. 689):** Recognized that the "minority of a victim of tender age who may be below the age of ten is quite manifest and the court can take judicial notice thereof."
*   **People v. Tulagan (849 Phil. 197):** Held that if the victim of rape through sexual assault is below 12 years old, the nomenclature of the crime should be "Sexual Assault under Article 266-A(2) of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of [Republic Act] No. 7610"
*   The decision discusses and abandons the line of cases that used the term "qualified statutory rape" (e.g., People v. Bantolo, People v. Reyes, People v. Laceste), aligning itself with earlier jurisprudence designating the crime as "qualified rape."
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806:** Civil liability: the law and jurisprudence set the minimum amounts of civil indemnity and damages but do not provide for a ceiling. Thus, the minimum amounts can be validly increased when the circumstances warrant.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Accused is found guilty and must serve the sentence.
*   Accused is liable for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to the victim in both cases.
*   Accused must pay a fine in Criminal Case No. 17007.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The court acknowledged a divergence in jurisprudence regarding the proper designation of the crime when elements of both statutory and qualified rape are present. This decision aims to clarify and settle this ambiguity by abandoning the label of "qualified statutory rape."
*   The decision creates a clearer rule for future cases but could potentially open avenues for challenging past convictions labeled as "qualified statutory rape."
*   The discrepancies in dates in the victim's testimony were resolved based on corroborating evidence but could have been a point of contention.

**Summary of Guidelines:**

The Court provided guidelines for the designation of rape offenses:

1. The crime shall be denominated as QUALIFIED RAPE of a minor and not qualified statutory rape if any of the special qualifying aggravating circumstances is present, i.e., twin circumstances of minority and relationship, or the age of the victim being below 7 years old, or the accused's knowledge of the mental disability of the victim at the time of the commission of rape. This rule shall apply whether the victim is below the statutory age or is suffering from mental retardation comparable to the intellectual capacity of a child below the statutory age.
2. The crime shall be denominated as QUALIFIED RAPE of a minor and not qualified statutory rape if the crime is attended with two or more special qualifying aggravating circumstances, i.e., twin circumstances of minority and relationship, or the age of the victim being below 7 years old, or the accused's knowledge of the mental disability of the victim at the time of the commission of rape. One of these aggravating circumstances is sufficient to qualify the crime. The unutilized special qualifying aggravating circumstances will be deemed as generic aggravating circumstances which may be appreciated if the facts warrant the imposition of a divisible penalty, i.e., existence of privileged mitigating circumstances under Article 69 of the RPC, and penalties in cases of frustrated and attempted felonies, and.for accomplices and accessories pursuant to Articles 50 to 57 of the RPC. Otherwise, any unutilized aggravating circumstances shall not be considered in the application of penalties.
3. The term "statutory age" in these guidelines shall mean either "below 12 years old" or "under 16 years old" depending on whether the crime of rape was committed before or after the effectivity of Republic Act No. 11648, respectively.
