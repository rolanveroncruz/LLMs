## Legal Document Summary: People v. Nepomuceno (G.R. No. 216062)

**Type of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (Reversal of CA Decision)

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, acquitting Hilario Nepomuceno of violating Sections 5 (sale of dangerous drugs) and 11(3) (possession of dangerous drugs) of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002). The SC found that the prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt due to violations of Section 21 of RA 9165 regarding chain of custody and handling of seized evidence.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Section 5, RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs):**  Requires proof of sale, trade, delivery, or giving away of dangerous drugs without legal authorization.  Conviction by RTC and affirmed by CA initially.
*   **Section 11(3), RA 9165 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs):** Requires proof of unauthorized possession of dangerous drugs. Conviction by RTC and affirmed by CA initially.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):** This is the core issue. The law mandates specific procedures for handling seized drugs, including:
    *   Immediate physical inventory and photographing of the seized items at the place of seizure, or nearest police station in case of warrantless arrest, in the presence of the accused/representative/counsel, elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media, who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof
*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21:** The arresting officers *failed to conduct the physical inventory and photograph the confiscated drug* as required by Section 21 *in the presence of required witnesses*.  Marking of evidence occurred at the police station, not at the scene.
*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:**  The last sentence of Section 21's implementing rules allows for non-compliance under justifiable grounds, *provided the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved*. However, the prosecution failed to adequately explain the procedural lapses. Lack of camera was considered improbable.

**Legal Arguments & Rationale:**

*   **Corpus Delicti:**  The SC emphasizes that the dangerous drug itself is the corpus delicti.  Its identity must be established beyond reasonable doubt. This requires a clear and unbroken chain of custody to prevent tampering, alteration, or substitution.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:**  The SC notes that the police's procedural lapses negate the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duties.
*   **Prosecution's Burden:** The prosecution bears the burden to prove justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21, and to demonstrate that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved despite the lapses. Failure to do so warrants acquittal.
*   **People v. Pagaduan:**  This case is cited to emphasize the importance of compliance with Section 21 and the consequence of acquittal when the prosecution fails to provide a justification for non-compliance.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Potential Civil Liability:** While the case addresses criminal liability, the accused might have grounds for civil action against the officers if the arrest and prosecution were found to be conducted with gross negligence or malicious intent.
*   **Reputational Risk:** The PNP risks reputational damage due to non-compliance with established procedures and the consequent acquittal of the accused.
*   **Evidence Suppression:**  The failure to follow procedure could lead to the suppression of illegally obtained evidence in future cases.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "justifiable grounds" exception in Section 21 is inherently ambiguous. What constitutes "justifiable grounds" is highly fact-dependent and subject to judicial interpretation. The subjective element introduces uncertainty.

**Recommendations:**

*   This case underscores the critical importance of strict adherence to Section 21 of RA 9165.  The PNP must implement rigorous training programs and monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance with the procedural requirements for handling seized evidence.
*   The prosecution should meticulously document the chain of custody and anticipate potential challenges to the admissibility of evidence due to procedural irregularities.
*   When procedural lapses occur, the prosecution must be prepared to present credible and compelling evidence to establish justifiable grounds and demonstrate the preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items.
*   The prosecution's explanation that "no camera available" for photography is incredibly weak. Proper tools must be supplied, and if not available, then *this* should be part of the explanation for justifiable grounds.
