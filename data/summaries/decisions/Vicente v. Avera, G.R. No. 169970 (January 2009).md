**Case Summary: Protacio Vicente and Dominga Vicente v. Delia Soledad Avera and Ronberto Valino (G.R. No. 169970, January 20, 2009)**

**Core Issue:** Whether the petitioners, as registered owners, are entitled to injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of a writ of execution arising from a separate case (Declaration of Nullity of Marriage case or JDRC case) where a notice of lis pendens was annotated on the property's title *after* the petitioners acquired the property.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Petitioners, granting the injunction.  The Court of Appeals' decision was reversed and set aside.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Ownership & Right to Possession:**  Petitioners are the registered owners of the property via a Deed of Absolute Sale dated October 1, 1987, and holding TCT No. 14216. Registration, under P.D. No. 1529 Section 51, is the operative act affecting land against third parties, making the TCT best proof of ownership (citing *Lee Tek Sheng v. Court of Appeals*). As registered owners, they have the right to possession (citing *Miranda v. Besa*).

*   **Injunction:** The Court lays out the requirements for granting an injunction: (1) a right *in esse* (right to be protected); and (2) a violation of that right (citing *Borbajo v. Hidden View Homeowners, Inc.*). The Court finds these requisites are met, the petitioner has a "clear legal right" as registered owner.

*   **Collateral Attack:** Respondents are improperly challenging the validity of the petitioner's title by claiming the Deed of Absolute Sale is nonexistent. This constitutes a prohibited collateral attack on a Torrens title under P.D. No. 1529, Section 48. (citing *Zaragoza v. Court of Appeals*). A direct action is necessary to challenge title validity.

*   **Lis Pendens:** The notice of lis pendens, annotated *after* the petitioners' acquisition (but before their registration), does *not* bind the petitioners. Constructive notice from a lis pendens applies only from the time of filing and only to parties designated by their real names, per Rule 14, Section 24 of the 1964 Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 13, Section 14 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. A lis pendens relates to litigation between a transferor and a third party, affecting subsequent transferees. Here, the JDRC case does not involve Rebuquiao (the original transferor to petitioners) and his title; thus, it doesn't affect petitioners. (citing *Yu v. Court of Appeals*, *Carrascoso, Jr. v. Court of Appeals*, *Po Lam v. Court of Appeals*, *Romero v. Court of Appeals*)

*   **Writ of Execution:** Enforcing the writ of execution from the JDRC case would violate petitioners' rights as registered owners to possess and enjoy the property. The registered owner is entitled to their ownership rights unless legally limited. (citing *Heirs of Rosendo Sevilla Florencio v. Heirs of Teresa Sevilla De Leon*)

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timing of Acquisition vs. Registration:** The court emphasizes the importance of the date of the Deed of Sale and the transfer of ownership as the basis for the decision. If evidence existed to challenge the veracity of the date on the Deed of Sale, the outcome might have differed.
*   **Bona Fide Purchaser:** The decision implies but doesn't explicitly state whether the petitioners are considered bona fide purchasers for value. If there was evidence of bad faith or knowledge of a prior claim at the time of acquisition, this could affect the outcome.
*   **Nature of Co-ownership in JDRC Case:**  The JDRC case involved the dissolution of a cohabitation and the determination of property rights. While the Supreme Court emphasizes the separate nature of this case from the Rebuquiao's title, complexities might arise in the future regarding the potential existence of a co-ownership claim existing prior to the sale by Rebuquiao, though it was not successfully claimed.
*   **No direct proceeding to nullify title**: In the future, the respondents could launch a separate, direct proceeding to declare the Deed of Sale and the petitioner's title void. If successful, this ruling could undo the current decision.
