## Legal Document Summary: *Television and Production Exponents, Inc. v. Servaña* (G.R. No. 167648)

**Core Issue:**  Determination of the nature of employment of Roberto Servaña by Television and Production Exponents, Inc. (TAPE) and the legality of his termination.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision that Servaña was a *regular employee* of TAPE, and that while his termination was for an authorized cause (redundancy), TAPE failed to observe statutory due process.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Regular Employment:** The Court applied the "four-fold test" (selection, wages, control, dismissal) and Art. 280 of the Labor Code to determine that Servaña, having worked for TAPE for 5 years, was a regular employee, despite TAPE's claims he was a "talent" or independent contractor.
*   **Redundancy Termination:** TAPE terminated Servaña due to redundancy (engaging a professional security agency). This is an authorized cause under Art. 283 of the Labor Code.
*   **Due Process Violation:**  The Court found that TAPE failed to provide the required one-month prior written notice to both Servaña and the Department of Labor and Employment before his termination. The *rollo* stated effectivity of his dismissal is fifteen days from the start of the agency’s take over which was on 3 March 2000.
*   **Separation Pay:** Despite the due process violation, the Court upheld the validity of the termination due to the authorized cause of redundancy, entitling Servaña to separation pay (1 month pay per year of service).
*   **Nominal Damages:** TAPE was ordered to pay nominal damages of P10,000 for failure to observe statutory due process in the termination.

**Liabilities:**

*   **TAPE:** Liable for separation pay and nominal damages (P10,000).
*   **Antonio P. Tuviera (President of TAPE):**  Absolved from personal liability, absent a showing of malice or bad faith.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Misclassification of Employee:** TAPE's attempt to classify Servaña as a "talent" or independent contractor was rejected, highlighting the risk of misclassifying employees and the potential for labor law violations.
*   **Compliance with DOLE regulations:** TAPE failed to prove compliance with requirements under Policy Instruction No. 40 (program employees) which requires registration of contracts.
*   **Due Process Requirements:**  The Court underscored the importance of strict adherence to the statutory due process requirements for termination due to authorized causes (Art. 283 and 284 of the Labor Code), including proper notice to both the employee and the DOLE. Failure to do so, even in cases of valid termination, can result in liability for nominal damages.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 280 of the Labor Code:** Defines regular and casual employment.
*   **Art. 283 of the Labor Code:** Governs termination due to authorized causes (redundancy).
*   **Four-Fold Test:** Used to determine employer-employee relationship.
*   **Policy Instruction No. 40:**  Defines program employees.

**Ambiguities & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Court emphasized the importance of proving all elements of the "four-fold test," particularly the element of control.  The level of control exercised by TAPE over Servaña's work was a contentious issue, with TAPE arguing that Servaña was an independent contractor free to determine his own methods.  The Court, however, gave more weight to the bundy card evidence and the fact that Servaña was required to report for work during specific hours.
