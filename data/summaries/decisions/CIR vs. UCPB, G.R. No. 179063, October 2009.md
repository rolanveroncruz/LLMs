## Legal Document Summary: CIR vs. UCPB (G.R. No. 179063)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a disputed tax assessment.

**Key Issue:**  Whether the three-month redemption period for juridical persons in extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings should be reckoned from the date of the auction sale or the date of the executive judge's approval of the Certificate of Sale.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court DENIED the CIR's petition, affirming the CTA En Banc's decision. The Court held that the redemption period begins from the date of the executive judge's approval of the Certificate of Sale.  Therefore, UCPB's payment of Creditable Withholding Tax (CWT) and Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) was timely.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 47 of the General Banking Law (R.A. 8791):** Grants juridical persons a three-month redemption period after extrajudicial foreclosure, but not after the registration of the certificate of foreclosure sale with the Registry of Deeds, which in no case shall be more than three months after foreclosure, whichever is earlier.
*   **Revenue Regulation 2-98, Section 2.58:** Defines the due date for CWT returns and payments (within 10 days after the end of each month, with exceptions for December).
*   **Revenue Regulation 06-01, Section 5:** Defines the due date for DST returns and payments (within five days after the close of the month when the taxable document was made, signed, accepted or transferred).
*   **Revenue Memorandum Circular 58-2008:** Clarifies that the redemption period for both individuals (one year) and juridical persons (three months) is reckoned from the date of the confirmation of the auction sale, i.e., when the certificate of sale is issued.  This clarifies and arguably changes BIR's previous stance.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Potential Liability:** The CIR initially assessed UCPB for deficiency CWT and DST due to alleged late payment, arguing the redemption period started from the auction sale date. This assessment was overturned.
*   **Current Status:** UCPB is NOT liable for deficiencies.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timing of "Foreclosure":** The primary point of contention was the definition of "foreclosure" for purposes of calculating the redemption period and consequently, the tax payment deadlines. The CIR argued for the auction sale date, while UCPB and ultimately the Court argued for the date of the executive judge's approval.
*   **Delay in Executive Judge Approval:** The CIR raised the concern that delays in the executive judge's approval could be used to manipulate tax payment deadlines. However, the Court emphasized the executive judge's role in ensuring compliance with extrajudicial foreclosure requirements *before* issuing the Certificate of Sale, citing *United Coconut Planters Bank v. Yap, 432 Phil. 536 (2002)*.
*   **Retroactive Application of RMC 58-2008:** The RMC 58-2008 issued during the pendency of the case arguably supports UCPB's position. While persuasive, the effect of applying the RMC retroactively on past transactions could be a point for further discussion.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 47, General Banking Law (R.A. 8791)**
*   **Revenue Regulation 2-98, Section 2.58**
*   **Revenue Regulation 06-01, Section 5**
*   **Revenue Memorandum Circular 58-2008**
*   **Administrative Matter 99-10-05-0:** Re: Procedure in Extrajudicial Foreclosure of Mortgage.
*   **United Coconut Planters Bank v. Yap, 432 Phil. 536 (2002)**

**Conclusion:**

This case provides important clarification on the reckoning point of the redemption period in extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings involving juridical persons. While the Court ruled in favor of UCPB, the initial ambiguity surrounding the term "foreclosure" and the potential for delay in the executive judge's approval remain areas of consideration for future transactions. RMC 58-2008 provides much needed clarity moving forward, solidifying the reckoning point of the redemption period.
