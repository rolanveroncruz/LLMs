## Legal Document Summary: Naranja vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 160132

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision upholding the validity of a Deed of Sale executed by Roque Naranja in favor of Lucilia Belardo.

**Facts:** Roque Naranja sold two properties to his half-sister, Lucilia Belardo, in 1981 via a notarized Deed of Sale.  Later, Roque executed another deed of sale over the same properties in favor of Margarita Dema-ala to secure a loan, which Belardo eventually paid off.  After Roque's death, his heirs (petitioners) executed an Extrajudicial Settlement among Heirs, claiming ownership of one of the properties. Belardo then filed suit for reconveyance, arguing she was the rightful owner based on the 1981 Deed of Sale. Petitioners countered with an action for annulment of the deed of sale.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Deed of Sale (August 21, 1981):** Purports to transfer ownership of Lot No. 4 and Roque's 1/3 share in Lot No. 2 to Belardo for P10,000.00 and other valuable consideration.
*   **Extrajudicial Settlement Among Heirs:**  Executed by petitioners in 1985, adjudicating Lot No. 4 among themselves.
*   **Second Deed of Sale in favor of Dema-ala:** Executed as collateral for loan, satisfied by Belardo.

**Issues:**

1.  Validity of the Deed of Sale absent a technical description as per Act No. 496.
2.  Validity of the Deed of Sale, considering the alleged vitiation of Roque Naranja's consent (undue influence, lack of consideration, irregularities in notarization).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, upholding the validity of the 1981 Deed of Sale.

**Key Rationale:**

*   **Technical Description:** The Court held that a technical description is *not* a mandatory requirement for a valid contract of sale. The contract is valid if there is (1) consent or meeting of the minds; (2) determinate subject matter; and (3) price certain in money or its equivalent. Here, the properties were adequately identified by lot number, area, and title number. Cites Art. 1458 and 1356 of the Civil Code.
*   **Vitiation of Consent:** Petitioners failed to present clear and convincing evidence of undue influence, lack of consideration, or notarization irregularities sufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity of a notarized document. Relies on *Herbon v. Palad*, G.R. No. 149542. Art. 1337 (undue influence) is cited.
*   **Heirs Bound by Contracts:**  Heirs are bound by contracts of their predecessors-in-interest (Art. 1311, Civil Code).  Therefore, the properties were no longer part of Roque's estate at the time of the Extrajudicial Settlement.
*   **Registration:** Registration is not required to validate the sale as between the parties.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Adequacy of Consideration:**  While the court found the recital of consideration in the Deed of Sale sufficient, a challenge could be mounted on whether the P10,000.00 adequately reflected the value of the properties at the time of the sale, which could potentially raise questions of gross inadequacy amounting to *lesion*.  This was not explicitly addressed in the decision, but might be further explored with additional evidence.
*   **Second Deed of Sale to Dema-ala:** While explained, this act raises questions on the Roque's ownership or authority to transfer.
*   **Formal requirements of notarization were followed.** The Court relies on presumption of regularity, but a closer examination of the notarization process would strengthen the holding.
