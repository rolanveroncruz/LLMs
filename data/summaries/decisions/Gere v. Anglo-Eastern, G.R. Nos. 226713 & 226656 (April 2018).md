## Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 226656 & 226713 - Gere v. Anglo-Eastern

**Case:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari concerning seafarer's disability benefits.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Arnel T. Gere (Seafarer)
*   **Respondents:** Anglo-Eastern Crew Management Phils., Inc. and/or Anglo-Eastern Crew Management (Asia), Ltd. (Employer/Manning Agency)

**Issue:** Whether the seafarer is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits under the POEA-SEC and/or the CBA. Key focus is on the timeliness and proper notification of disability assessment by the company-designated physician.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court **affirmed** the Court of Appeals decision. While finding the seafarer's disability to be total and permanent *by operation of law* due to the employer's failure to properly notify the seafarer of the company-designated physician's (CDP) assessment within the prescribed timeframe, the Court ultimately awarded benefits according to the **POEA-SEC**, not the CBA.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **POEA-SEC, Section 20(A)(3):** Governs compensation for work-related injury or illness, emphasizing the importance of the CDP's assessment. Requires referral to a third doctor if the seafarer's doctor disagrees.
*   **CBA (AMOSUP/Anglo-Eastern):** Provides for higher disability benefits, particularly Article 20.1.4 regarding permanent medical unfitness (50% disability or certification of unfitness by the company doctor).

**Liabilities & Award:**

*   Employer liable for disability benefits.
*   Award: US$60,000.00 representing permanent total disability under the POEA-SEC.  The higher CBA benefits were denied because the seafarer's disability rating by his personal doctor was less than 50%, and there was no certification of unfitness from the company-designated physician. Sickness allowance was deleted for lack of merit, no discussion in the summary.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timeliness and Notification of CDP Assessment:** This is the central issue. The Court emphasizes the **dual** requirement: the CDP must *issue* the assessment *and give* it to the seafarer. Failure to properly notify the seafarer triggers a finding of permanent and total disability by operation of law under the *Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc.* doctrine (765 Phil. 341 (2015)).
*   **Mandatory Third Doctor Referral:** While generally mandatory when assessments conflict (*Formerly INC Shipmanagement, Inc. vs. Rosales*, G.R. No. 195832, October 1, 2014, 737 SCRA 438), the obligation to seek a third doctor *only* arises *after* the seafarer has been duly informed of the CDP's assessment.
*   **Application of CBA vs. POEA-SEC:** The Court prioritized the POEA-SEC benefits in this case because the conditions for entitlement under the CBA's permanent medical unfitness clause were not met (specifically, lack of a 50% disability rating and lack of certification of unfitness from the company doctor). This highlights the importance of specific clauses within the CBA and whether the seafarer qualifies under their explicit terms.
*     **Evidence of Notification**: The court found insufficient the evidence (letters between physicians, emails to counsel) presented by the employer to prove proper and timely notification of the seafarer of the CDP's assessment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 192(c)(1):** Pertains to permanent total disability.
*   **Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation, Section 2, Rule X:** Relates to the period of entitlement.
*   **_Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. vs. Quiogue, Jr._ (765 Phil. 341 (2015)) and Paulino M. Aldaba vs. Career Philippines Ship-Management, Inc. Columbia Ship Management Ltd.:** Establishes guidelines for the 120/240-day rule regarding the CDP's assessment.
*   **Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Overseas Employment of Filipino Seafarers On-board Ocean-going Ships (POEA-SEC):** Standard contract governing seafarers' employment.
*   **Formerly INC Shipmanagement, Inc. vs. Rosales (G.R. No. 195832, October 1, 2014, 737 SCRA 438):** Clarifies the mandatory nature of the third-doctor referral process.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguous nature of the "suggested" disability ratings by Dr. Bernal, as well as the CDP not directly communicating the assessments to the seafarer were contentious points.
*   The respondentsâ€™ reliance on the third-party physician referral process without first properly communicating the CDP assessment.

**In essence, the document highlights the critical importance of proper and timely notification of the seafarer regarding the company-designated physician's assessment, and the procedural requirements for referral to a third doctor.  While a failure to provide such notice triggers a finding of total and permanent disability, entitlement to specific benefits ultimately depends on meeting the specific requirements under either the POEA-SEC or the CBA.**
