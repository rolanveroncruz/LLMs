## Legal Document Summary: Olegario v. Mari, G.R. No. 147951 (Dec. 14, 2009)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding ownership and possession of land.

**Key Issue:** Ownership of Lot Nos. 17553, 17526, and 14356 of the Mangatarem Cadastre.  The central question is whether the Olegarios acquired ownership through acquisitive prescription or were merely occupying the land by tolerance. The CA reversed the RTC, finding for Mari.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, declaring Pedro Mari (represented by Lilia C. Mari-Camba) the lawful owner of the disputed lots.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Acquisitive Prescription:** The Court held that the Olegarios failed to establish ownership through acquisitive prescription. Their possession was not adverse, lacking a just title and the requisite hostility toward the true owner until 1989.
*   **Possession:** Mari's predecessor, Juan Mari, possessed the property since 1916, evidenced by tax declarations, a house, fruit-bearing trees, a bamboo fence, and later transferred to Mari through a deed of sale.  This possession was found to be "in the concept of owner, publicly and peacefully."
*   **Tax Declarations:** Juan Mari's early tax declarations are strong evidence of ownership.  The Olegarios' tax declaration initially covered only a 50 sq. meter parcel, a fact that undermined their claim to the larger disputed area.  Their attempted expansion of the declared area in 1989 was too late to establish prescription.
*   **Laches:** The Court rejected the Olegarios' argument of laches, finding that Mari did not unreasonably delay asserting his rights. He acted promptly upon discovering the Olegarios' change in position in 1989.
*   **Tolerance:** The Court suggests the Olegario's initial use of the land was through tolerance and would therefore not meet requirements for adverse possession.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 538 (possession), 1137 (extraordinary prescription), Articles regarding Acquisitive Prescription (generally)
*   The ruling relies heavily on principles of adverse possession and the requirements for acquisitive prescription under the Civil Code.

**Case Law:**

*   The Court cites several cases regarding acquisitive prescription, the requirements for adverse possession (e.g., *Ceque√±a v. Bolante*, *Bogo-Medellin Milling Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*), and the principles of laches (e.g., *Avisado v. Rumbaua*). It emphasized that possession to constitute the foundation of a prescriptive right must be possession under claim of title, that is, it must be adverse.
*   The Court also emphasizes *San Miguel Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, citing the legal fiction created through "open, exclusive and undisputed possession of alienable public land for the period prescribed by law."

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Evidence of Juan Mari's Possession:** While tax declarations are cited, the specific details of his "possessory acts" (planting trees, building a house, etc.) are not extensively detailed, which could be a point of scrutiny.
*   **Nature of Tolerance:** The specific facts indicating that Olegario's occupation was initially through tolerance are not comprehensively presented.

**Obligations:**

*   The Olegarios are obligated to relinquish possession of Lot Nos. 17553, 17526, and 14356 to Mari.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Olegarios are liable for the costs of the suit.

**Next Steps for Mari:**

*   Enforce the Supreme Court's decision to regain possession.
*   Take steps to ensure clear title and prevent future disputes.
