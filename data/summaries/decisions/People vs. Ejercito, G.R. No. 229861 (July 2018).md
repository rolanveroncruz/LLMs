## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Ejercito (G.R. No. 229861)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for Rape.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Accusation:** Accused-Appellant, Francisco Ejercito, was charged with Rape under Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic Act No. (RA) 8353 ("The Anti-Rape Law of 1997"). The information alleged that on October 10, 2001, Ejercito, through force and intimidation, had carnal knowledge of AAA, a 15-year-old minor.
*   **Elements of Rape (Art. 266-A, RPC):**
    *   Offender had carnal knowledge of a woman.
    *   Act accomplished through force, threat, or intimidation.
*   **Penalty (Art. 266-B, RPC):** Reclusion perpetua.
*   **SC Clarification on application of Section 5 (b) of RA 7610 vs RA 8353** the SC clarifies that in cases where a minor is raped through sexual intercourse, the provisions on rape under RA 8353 amending the RPC should prevail over Section 5 (b) of RA 7610.
*   **Monetary Awards:** P75,000.00 as civil indemnity ex delicto, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, with legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of the ruling until fully paid.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Ejercito:** Found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Rape under Article 266-A of the RPC (as amended by RA 8353) and sentenced to reclusion perpetua, and ordered to pay AAA, moral damages, exemplary damages, and civil indemnity.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Initial CA Error:** The CA initially erred in applying the repealed Article 335 of the RPC instead of RA 8353. This was corrected by the Supreme Court.
*   **Sweetheart Defense:** Ejercito's defense of a consensual relationship was rejected, with the Courts noting that even if a later relationship existed, the initial encounter involved force and intimidation.
*   **Overlapping Laws:** The Supreme Court addresses potential conflict between Article 266-A of RPC and RA 7610, Section 5(b) regarding abuse of minors and decides that RA 8353 should prevail.
*   **Retraction of previous jurisprudence:** The SC expressly retracts the prior jurisprudence established in "Tubillo" cases, which focused on the "focus of the evidence" instead of legal interpretation in determining the applicable provision between RA 7610 and RA 8353 in rape cases involving minors.
*   **Penalty Discrepancies:** The SC admits a potential discrepancy in penalties between R.A. 7610 and R.A. 8353 but concludes that they cannot amend this discrepancy as this is solely under the perview of the legislative.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 266-A & 266-B:** Rape, defining elements and penalties.
*   **Republic Act No. 8353 ("The Anti-Rape Law of 1997"):** Amends the RPC regarding rape.
*   **Republic Act No. 7610:** Providing Special Protection against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination
*   **Quimvel v. People (G.R. No. 214497):** Defines "child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse."
*   **Teves v. Sandiganbayan (488 Phil. 311):** Statutory Construction - special law prevails over general law.
*   **People v. Tubillo (G.R. No. 220718):** Prior case law on conflicting laws (retracted by this decision).
*   **People v. Caoili (G.R. No. 196342):** Distinguishing the proper offence in cases lascivious conduct

**Ambiguities/Contentious Points:**

*   The potential ambiguity in the initial CA application of law, requiring Supreme Court intervention for clarification.
*   The SC acknowledges the prior jurisprudence in the "Tubillo" cases and retracts from the previous standard of "focus of evidence" when it comes to rape against a minor.
*   The SC acknowledged but refused to intervene in the potential differences in penalty under R.A. 7610 and 8353, but concluded that this is a matter for legislative action and not judicial remedy.
