**Case:** *Elmer Padua y Garin a.k.a. "Eming" v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 268564, June 10, 2024

**Summary:**

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to reverse the CA's decision which affirmed with modification the RTC's judgment finding Elmer Padua guilty of Sexual Assault under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), in relation to Article III, Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act). The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition and affirmed the conviction.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Elmer was charged with rape through sexual assault under Article 266-A, par. 2 of the RPC (as originally classified by lower courts). The SC reclassified it as sexual assault as mentioned above.
*   **Facts:** Elmer inserted his finger into the vagina of AAA, a 3-year-old child, in 2014.
*   **Medico-Legal Evidence:** The Medico-Legal Report showed erythematous and hymenal laceration, supporting the victim's testimony.
*   **Penalty Imposed by SC:** Indeterminate sentence of 12 years, 10 months, and 21 days of reclusion temporal (minimum) to 15 years, six months and 20 days of reclusion temporal (maximum), a fine of PHP 15,000.00, and monetary awards totaling PHP 150,000.00 (civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages), all subject to 6% legal interest per annum from finality of judgment.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Elmer Padua is obligated to serve the imposed sentence and pay the fine and monetary awards.
*   Monetary awards due to the victim AAA.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** Elmer argued that inconsistencies in AAA's sworn statement and testimony rendered her unreliable. The SC dismissed these as relating to extraneous matters not affecting the material elements of the crime, and attributable to the passage of time.
*   **Infantile Amnesia:** Elmer invoked the theory of infantile amnesia (citing *People v. De Jesus*, 454 Phil. 781 (2003)) to argue that AAA couldn't accurately recall the events. The SC rejected this, stating that Elmer failed to present evidence of AAA's intellectual incapacity and that this theory can be used only for inconsistencies in the declarations of the victim (*People v. Magbitang, G.R. No. 175592 (Notice), August 16, 2016*).
*   **Reclassification of Offense:** The CA and RTC classified it as Rape by Sexual Assault, but the SC reclassified it as Sexual Assault under Article 266-A(2) of the RPC, in relation to Article III, Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610.
*   **Double Aggravation:** The SC clarified that because the victim was under 12 years of age, the circumstances for a higher penalty are already inherent in the crime and cannot be used as an aggravating circumstance anymore (*People v. ABC260708, G.R. No. 260708, January 23, 2024*).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Art. 266-A(2) (Sexual Assault).
*   **Republic Act No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act):** Art. III, Sec. 5(b).
*   **Republic Act No. 8353 (The Anti-Rape Law of 1997).**
*   **People v. Tulagan, 849 Phil. 197 (2019)**: Addressed the distinction between rape by sexual assault and lasciviousness when the victim is a minor.
*   **People v. De Jesus, 454 Phil. 781 (2003)**: Discussed infantile amnesia.
*   **People v. Magbitang, G.R. No. 175592 (Notice), August 16, 2016**: Clarified the requirement for proving infantile amnesia.
*   **People v. ABC260708, G.R. No. 260708, January 23, 2024**: Clarified that the minority of the victim cannot be used as an aggravating circumstance if it already qualifies the nature of the crime.

**Conclusion:**

The SC affirmed the conviction and modified the offense classification. The risks lie in any potential future challenge to the credibility of the victim's testimony, given the issues raised regarding inconsistencies and infantile amnesia, although those arguments were rejected. The key issue is that the original classification of rape by sexual assault has been reclassified, which opens the way for the current classification to be Sexual Assault in relation to the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.
