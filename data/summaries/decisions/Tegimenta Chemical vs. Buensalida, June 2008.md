## Legal Document Summary - *Tegimenta Chemical Phils./Vivian D. Garcia vs. Rolan E. Buensalida*, G.R. No. 176466

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a constructive illegal dismissal case.

**Key Issue:** Whether the respondent, Buensalida, engaged in forum shopping by filing two separate NLRC cases: (1) in Davao City (illegal deduction) and (2) in Quezon City (constructive illegal dismissal).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, finding no forum shopping because the two NLRC cases (Davao and Quezon City) involved different causes of action, issues, and factual bases, even though related.

**Key Provisions/Analysis:**

*   **Forum Shopping:** The Court focused on whether *litis pendentia* existed between the two cases, specifically if they involved the same rights asserted and relief prayed for, founded on the same set of facts, and if a judgment in one would amount to *res judicata* in the other. The Court found that, while there was identity of parties, the rights asserted, factual bases, and reliefs sought differed.
*   **NLRC Procedure:** The Court emphasized that in NLRC cases, the "complaint" (blank form) is not solely determinative of the cause of action. The *position paper* is critical in defining the issues and scope of the case. The court referred to *Section 3, Rule V of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC, as amended by NLRC Resolution No. 01-02 (Series of 2002)*.
*   **Causes of Action:** The Davao case centered on illegal deductions and refusal to complete SSS/PhilHealth forms following a work-related injury (work-related). The QC case involved a later claim of constructive illegal dismissal stemming from a transfer and changes in work conditions, along with underpayment of wages/benefits.
*   **Consolidation:** The Court acknowledged that consolidating the cases would be efficient, but *Section 3, Rule IV of the NLRC Rules of Procedure* prevented consolidation due to the cases being filed in different Regional Arbitration Branches.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Tegimenta Chemical:** Liable to proceed with defending the constructive illegal dismissal case in the NLRC-NCR, and potentially liable for backwages, separation pay, damages, and underpaid wages/benefits, if found liable.
* **Rolan E. Buensalida:** The respondent must pursue the case at NCR- North SEC No. 00-10-12481-03.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Substantive Outcome of the QC Case:** Tegimenta Chemical faces the risk of an adverse judgment in the constructive illegal dismissal case, requiring significant financial payouts.
* **Double Recovery:** While the cases are distinct, there is a potential for the Labor Arbiter in Quezon City to inadvertently award damages that overlap with the Davao case.
* **Delayed Resolution of the Case:** Because of the delay in the NLRC to proceed on NCR NORTH SEC Case No. 00-01-12481-03, there will be a liability and greater exposure of the respondent to an adverse judgement.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 2, Sec. 2** (Definition of Cause of Action)
*   **NLRC Rules of Procedure, Section 3, Rule V** (Importance of Position Paper)
*   **NLRC Rules of Procedure, Section 3, Rule IV** (Consolidation of Cases)
*   **Guaranteed Hotels, Inc. v. Baltao, G.R. No. 164338, January 17, 2005** (Definition of Forum Shopping)
*   **Mondragon Leisure and Resorts Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 154188, June 15, 2005** (Elements of *litis pendentia* and *res judicata*)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of "constructive illegal dismissal" hinges on subjective interpretation and could be challenged on appeal, especially if the re-assignment was genuinely for cost-cutting purposes.

**Recommendation:** The lawyer should focus on preparing a strong defense to the Quezon City case on the merits, emphasizing legitimate business reasons for the reassignment and challenging the claim of constructive illegal dismissal. Mitigation of any damages claim should be addressed by arguing the separation pay.
