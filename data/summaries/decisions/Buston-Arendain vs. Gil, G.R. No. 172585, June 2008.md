**Case Summary: *Cristita Buston-Arendain and Heirs of Bautista Arendain vs. Antonia Gil, et al.*, G.R. No. 172585, June 26, 2008**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) ruling that declared the Petitioners' OCT No. P-10522 null and void.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Respondents (Gil, et al.) were required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing an action in court to nullify the Petitioners' (Arendain, et al.) titles.

**Facts:**

*   Respondents (Gils) filed a complaint in RTC Davao City seeking the nullification of titles, quieting of title, recovery of possession, accounting, and damages against Petitioners (Arendains) involving land covered by OCT No. P-6075, P-6079, and P-6080, claiming prior ownership since 1976.
*   Respondents alleged that the petitioners fraudulently obtained OCT Nos. P-10541 and P-10522, which covered land already registered in the name of Respondents under OCT Nos. P-6079 and P-6080.
*   CENRO acknowledged a pending administrative case between Antonia Gil and Bautista Arendain regarding OCT Nos. P-10552 and P-6080.
*   Petitioners were declared in default in the RTC for failure to file a pre-trial brief and appear at pre-trial. This default order was upheld by the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 44118 and subsequently by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. 131877, due to the late filing of the appeal.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Respondents, declaring OCT No. P-10522 (Arendain) and a portion of OCT No. P-10541 (Arendain) as null and void. Only Bautista Arendain appealed to the CA.
*   The CA affirmed the RTC, finding that the Respondents' titles (OCT Nos. P-6079 and P-6080) were issued earlier in 1976, and that the subject parcels of land ceased to be part of the public domain when titles were issued, thus, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the Petition, affirming the CA decision.

**Rationale:**

*   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** The Court reiterated the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, but acknowledged its exceptions. One key exception: It does not apply when the subject matter is private land. *Ramoso v. Obligado, 70 Phil. 86 (1940), Pamintuan v. San Agustin, 43 Phil 558 (1922)*
*   **Private Land:** Because the Respondents' titles were issued in 1976, the land ceased to be public land and became private property. Consequently, the Director of Lands lost control and jurisdiction. Therefore, the exception to the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies applies *Soto v. Jareno, 228 Phil. 117, 119 (1986).*
*   **Indefeasibility of Title:** Upon registration, the land falls under the operation of Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act) and becomes registered land *Republic v. Guerrero, G.R. No.133168, 28 March 2006*. Torrens title is evidence of indefeasible title in favor of the registered owner. *Heirs of Gregorio Tengco v. Heirs of Jose Aliwalas, G.R. No. L-77541, 29 November 1988, 168 SCRA 198, 203-204.*
*   **Factual Findings:** The Court deferred to the factual findings of the RTC and CA, that the Respondent's patent applications were approved and titles issued earlier than the Petitioner's.
*   **Forum Shopping:** The Court declined to rule on the issue of forum shopping based on Civil Case No. 7068, as it was not sufficiently established that the case involved the same subject matter or issues.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Nullification of Titles:** OCT No. P-10522 in the name of Bautista Arendain declared null and void.  A portion of OCT No. P-10541 in the name of Domingo Arendain was also declared null and void.
*   **Duty to Vacate:** Petitioners are ordered to vacate the parcels of land covered by OCT Nos. P-6075, P-6079, and P-6080.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Forum Shopping (Unresolved):** While the court did not find forum shopping, the prior case (Civil Case No. 7068) raises a flag.  Further investigation into the specific land and issues in that case is warranted.
*   **Heirs of Bautista Arendain:** The case is brought by "Heirs of Bautista Arendain represented by Cristita Buston-Arendain." Proper verification of the heirs and the representative's authority is crucial.
*   **Damages:** The dispositive portion of the RTC decision, specifically in regard to the damages, was not mentioned by the appellate courts and may be an avenue of attack by the other party if not considered in the final decision.
*   **Title Indefeasibility:** While a Torrens title is generally indefeasible, this case demonstrates exceptions based on prior registration and fraud in obtaining the later title.

**Statutory References:**

*   Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act)
*   Section 122 of the Land Registration Act

**Conclusion:**

The Arendains lost the case primarily due to the application of the exception to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine. Since the Gil's titles predated the Arendain's and the land was deemed private, the courts found that the Gils were not required to pursue administrative remedies prior to filing a court action. The case highlights the importance of priority of registration in land disputes and the limitations of the indefeasibility of Torrens titles.
