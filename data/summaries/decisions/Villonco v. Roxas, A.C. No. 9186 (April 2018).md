**Summary of *A.C. No. 9186, April 11, 2018 (Atty. Juan Paulo Villonco v. Atty. Romeo G. Roxas)***

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against a lawyer for violating the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

**Key Facts:**

*   Atty. Roxas was retained by Republic Real Estate Corporation (RREC) on a contingent basis for a case regarding reclaimed land.
*   Atty. Roxas proceeded with certain actions (filing motions, administrative complaints against CA Justices, and a petition challenging a Presidential Decree) *without* obtaining proper consent or authorization from RREC's Board of Directors. Specifically, he defied instructions to defer filing a motion for execution.
*   RREC terminated Atty. Roxas's retainer agreement due to these unauthorized actions.
*   Despite termination, Atty. Roxas continued to appear for RREC and threatened to sue the RREC Board members unless reinstated.

**Key Provisions & Obligations Violated:**

*   **Canon 17 of the CPR:** A lawyer owes fidelity to the cause of his client and shall be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in him. The court found a breach of this canon based on Atty. Roxas's disregard for the client's instructions and unauthorized actions.
*   **Section 27 of Rule 138 of the Rules of Court:** Relates to an attorney's authority and likely the ethical implications of proceeding without client consent, though this isn't explicitly detailed in the document.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   The IBP initially recommended censure.
*   The IBP Board of Governors modified this to a **six (6) month suspension** from the practice of law.
*   The Supreme Court **increased the suspension to one (1) year**.
*   The Court cited Atty. Roxas's prior disciplinary record (indirect contempt in *Roxas v. De Zuzuarregui, G.R. No. 152072, July 12, 2007*) as an aggravating factor.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Canon 17, CPR:**  Directly violated.
*   **Section 27, Rule 138, Rules of Court:** Violated
*   **Roxas v. De Zuzuarregui, G.R. No. 152072, July 12, 2007:**  Cited as a prior disciplinary case against Atty. Roxas.
*   **Malvar v. Kraft Food Phils., Inc., et al., 717 Phil. 427, 450-451 (2013):**  Confirms the client's right to discharge an attorney, subject to the attorney's right to compensation and a possible lien.
*   **Mercado v. Atty. Vitriolo, 498 Phil. 49, 57 (2007):** Highlights the fiduciary nature of the attorney-client relationship.
*   **Samonte v. Atty. Jumamil, A.C. No. 11668, July 17, 2017:** Confirms that clients expect lawyers to be mindful of their cause.
*   **Tabang v. Atty. Gacott, 713 Phil. 578, 593 (2013):** Stresses that the practice of law is in the public interest and lawyers must uphold high moral standards.
*   **Ramiscal v. Atty. Orro, A.C. No. 10945, February 23, 2016:**  Used as precedent.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Contingency Fee Arrangement:** Atty. Roxas argued he couldn't be removed due to a contingency fee agreement with "interest". The court acknowledges the right to compensation upon termination but doesn't explicitly address the validity or enforceability of the contingency fee arrangement itself, especially regarding the "interest" component. This could be a source of further dispute.
*   **Scope of Authority:**  Atty. Roxas claimed "blanket authority". The Court rejected this argument, especially concerning non-procedural matters. However, the precise contours of what constitutes a procedural vs. non-procedural matter could be argued.
*  **Compensation:**  The Court acknowledged that the lawyer is entitled to compensation for his services. However, the document lacks information of how this compensation should be computed in this specific case.
**Ambiguous Areas:**

*   The specific nature of the "interest" component within the contingency fee is unclear and could be interpreted in various ways.
*   The extent of a lawyer's "blanket authority" versus the client's right to control the course of the litigation on non-procedural matters remains somewhat open to interpretation.
* The document does not provide specifics as to whether the client needs to fully compensate the lawyer and how the amount of compensation is computed, considering that the attorney was terminated for not following directives.
