**Case Summary: *The Congregation of the Religious of the Virgin Mary v. Court of Appeals and Spouses Protasio***

**Citation:** 353 Phil. 591 (G.R. No. 126363, June 26, 1998)

**Core Issue:**  Recovery of possession of real property (Lot 5-B) based on encroachment, validity of claim of perpetual easement, and propriety of damages awarded.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Ownership:** Spouses Protasio (Respondents) own Lot 5-B, purchased from the heirs of Gervacio Serapio in 1989. Congregation of the Religious of the Virgin Mary (Petitioner) owns adjacent lots (5-A and 5-C), purchased from Serapio in 1964.
*   **Encroachment:** Petitioner encroached on 664 sq. meters of Lot 5-B, constructing a boys' quarters and part of a gymnasium without the Respondents' consent.
*   **Petitioner's Claim:** Petitioner alleges Serapio ceded perpetual use of Lot 5-B as a road lot providing access to a public road, based on a 1959 "Agreement of Purchase and Sale" for Lots 5-A and 5-C.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** Trial Court and Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Respondents, ordering Petitioner to vacate, demolish improvements, and pay damages.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Originally):** Ordered to vacate encroached portion, demolish improvements, and pay damages.
*   **Petitioner (Upon Appeal):** Only obligation is to vacate the land and remove structures, due to reversal on damage awards (detailed below).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses/Contentious Points:**

*   **Easement Claim:** The core legal dispute revolves around the validity of the Petitioner's claim to a perpetual easement for a right of way. Petitioner relies on the "Agreement of Purchase and Sale" and an attached sketch, which the Court found insufficient to establish an express or implied grant of easement. This highlights the risk associated with informal agreements regarding land use.
*   **Builder in Bad Faith:** The finding that the Petitioner was a builder in bad faith is critical as it triggers the provisions of the Civil Code concerning ownership of improvements made on another's land (e.g., Article 449, et seq.).
* **Laches:** Petitioner argued the respondents claim was barred by laches, which was promptly dismissed by the court as the respondents immediately conducted a survey and filed demand letters shortly after the purchase of the land in dispute
*   **Damages Award:** The Supreme Court reversed the award of back rentals, moral damages, and attorney's fees.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Rules of Court (Rule 45, Section 1):** Scope of review on certiorari (limited to errors of law).
*   **Revised Rules of Court (Rule 130, Section 9):** Parol evidence rule (written agreement deemed to contain all terms).
*   **Civil Code (Article 2199):** Actual Damages requires adequate compensation, as damages must be duly proven.
*   **Civil Code (Article 2208):** Award of attorney's fees (requires factual, legal, and equitable justification).
*  **Civil Code (Article 2217):** Moral damages awardable through proper pleading and proof of moral suffering, mental anguish, fright and the like.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court MODIFIED the Court of Appeals decision. The order to vacate and demolish the improvements was AFFIRMED. The awards for back rentals, moral damages, and attorney's fees were DELETED.

**Legal Advice/Next Steps:**

Review of the original "Agreement of Purchase and Sale" and any related documentation is crucial. Consideration should be given to options for negotiating an easement with the Spouses Protasio or potentially purchasing the encroached portion of Lot 5-B.
