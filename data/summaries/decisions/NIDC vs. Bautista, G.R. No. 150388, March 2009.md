## Legal Document Summary: NIDC vs. Spouses Bautista (G.R. No. 150388)

**Case Summary:**

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision which ordered NIDC to reconvey a portion of land to Spouses Bautista. The case revolves around conflicting claims to a 6,368 sq. meter lot, particularly a 5,546 sq. meter portion. The dispute stems from a series of transactions: a sale by the Spouses Bautista to Del Rosario (covering only 822 sq. meters), a mortgage by Del Rosario to PCIB (incorrectly including the entire 6,368 sq. meters), subsequent foreclosure by PCIB, an assignment of rights from PCIB to NIDC, and a mortgage by the Spouses Bautista to Banco Filipino (allegedly including the entire 6,368 sq. meters), followed by foreclosure by Banco Filipino and "redemption" (effectively a sale) by NIDC.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Initial Sale to Del Rosario:** Spouses Bautista sold only 822 sq. meters of the 6,368 sq. meter lot to Del Rosario.
*   **PCIB Mortgage:** Del Rosario improperly mortgaged the *entire* 6,368 sq. meter lot to PCIB despite only owning a portion.
*   **Assignment PCIB to NIDC:** PCIB assigned its rights as mortgagee and successful bidder to NIDC.
*   **Banco Filipino Mortgage:** Spouses Bautista mortgaged properties, allegedly including the 6,368 sq. meter lot, to Banco Filipino. **Contentious Point:** The Spouses Bautista claimed they only intended to annotate a right of way on the title held by Banco Filipino, not to mortgage the entire property.
*   **Banco Filipino Foreclosure & Sale:** Banco Filipino foreclosed on the Spouses Bautista's mortgage.
*   **"Redemption" by NIDC:** NIDC paid Banco Filipino an amount to acquire the foreclosed properties, including the 6,368 sq. meter lot. *The Court argues this was, in effect, a sale rather than a true redemption, as it occurred after the redemption period had expired.*
*   **Court order to dismiss the case**

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **NIDC:** Risk of being forced to reconvey a significant portion of the property. Initial risk of potentially invalid acquisition of ownership because the original mortgage to PCIB was not valid.
*   **Spouses Bautista:** Risk of losing all rights to the land. Potential liability for costs of suit.
*   **Banco Filipino:** Risk of liability if found to have acted negligently in including the entire property in the mortgage.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3135 (as amended by RA 4118):**  Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages. Relevant to the "redemption" issue and the calculation of the redemption period. Specifically, Section 6 regarding the right of redemption.
*   **Article 2085 of the New Civil Code:** Defines the requisites for a valid mortgage, specifically requiring the mortgagor to be the absolute owner of the property. This is critical regarding the validity of Del Rosario's mortgage to PCIB.
*   **Article 13 of the New Civil Code:** Defines how to calculate time periods, specifically that a year is 365 days. Relevant to determining if the 'redemption' was timely.
*   **Res Judicata:** A central issue is whether prior rulings in *Civil Case No. Q-8407* and *National Investment Development Corporation v. Judge De los Angeles (G.R. No. L-30150)* bar the Spouses Bautista from re-litigating the validity of the PCIB mortgage and the assignment to NIDC. The current ruling states that the parties are barred from challenging the mortgage based on these previous cases.
*   **Stare Decisis:** NIDC argues that the previous Supreme Court ruling constitutes a precedent binding the current court. The SC agreed that previous ruling are binding.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Key Arguments:**

*   **The nature of NIDC's "redemption" from Banco Filipino:** NIDC claims it purchased the property outright, while the Spouses Bautista initially argued it was a redemption that should be subject to equitable considerations. The Court determined that the "redemption" was, in effect, a purchase because the redemption period had already expired.
*   **The extent of the Banco Filipino Mortgage:** The central factual dispute is whether the Spouses Bautista intended to mortgage the entire 6,368 sq. meter lot to Banco Filipino or merely allow annotation of a right-of-way. The Court found the evidence pointed to the former.
*   **Validity of PCIB Mortgage:**  The court stated PCIB Mortgage was never valid because the party mortgaging the property only owned a portion of the entire mortgage so PCIB could not assign the right of the entire mortgage to NIDC
*   **Res Judicata Application:** This case hinged significantly on whether the issue of validity of the PCIB mortgage and subsequent assignment had already been settled in previous cases, and therefore could not be re-litigated.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Court ultimately ruled in favor of NIDC, stating that that *res judicata* prevented the Spouses Bautista from relitigating the validity of the mortgage assigned from PCIB to NIDC. The court also stated that they found that all the properties mortgaged to NIDC by the Spouses Bautista had passed over due to the sale/purchase agreement.
