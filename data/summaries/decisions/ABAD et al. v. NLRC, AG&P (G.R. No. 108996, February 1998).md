## Legal Document Summary: Abad v. NLRC, G.R. No. 108996, February 20, 1998

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing the NLRC's decision reversing the Labor Arbiter's ruling in favor of the Petitioners.

**Key Issue:** Whether Petitioners, former employees of Atlantic Gulf and Pacific Co. (AG&P) at the Poro Point Project, were project employees or regular employees.

**Ruling:** Petition DENIED. The Supreme Court AFFIRMED the NLRC's decision that the Petitioners were project employees.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **AG&P's Position:** Petitioners were hired as project employees for definite periods depending on the need for their specific skills, contingent upon project contracts.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:** They were non-project employees who attained regular status after one year of service and were thus entitled to CBA benefits and other regular employee benefits. They alleged unfair labor practices.
*   **NLRC's Decision:** Reversed the Labor Arbiter and held that the workers were project employees. Relied on the principle of *stare decisis* based on the "identical and analogous" case of *Abuan v. AG&P*.
*   **Court's Rationale:**
    *   **Stare Decisis:**  The Court emphasized that *stare decisis* was appropriately applied due to the factual similarity between this case and *Abuan v. AG&P*. Petitioners themselves admitted the similarity.
    *   **Project Employees:** The Petitioners' contracts were for specific projects, aligning with the definition of project employees under Art. 280 of the Labor Code and Policy Instruction No. 20.
    *   **Variety of Roles:** Unlike *Caramol v. NLRC*, where the employee consistently performed the same task, Petitioners worked in various capacities, suggesting hiring based on specific project needs. This indicated that the employees were hired according to skills available rather than necessarily desirable or essential to the usual business of the employer.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, the Labor Arbiter ordered AG&P to reinstate Petitioners with full backwages and benefits, or alternatively, to pay separation pay.
*   The NLRC reversed the decision of the Labor Arbiter except that NLRC ordered private respondents to pay petitioners backwages from July 2, 1992 to November 17, 1992, for failure of private respondent AG&P to reinstate them pending appeal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Misapplication of Stare Decisis:** The blanket application of *stare decisis* without a thorough, independent examination of the facts specific to each petitioner could be a point of contention.
*   **Contractual Ambiguity:** The Labor Arbiter noted alleged blank spaces on employment contracts concerning workers' designation, rate of wages, duration of employment, the name of the project they were to work on and the duration of the project. This could imply AG&P circumvented labor laws.
*   **Lack of Motion for Reconsideration:** Petitioners' failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration before filing the Petition for Certiorari was a significant procedural flaw.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 280:** Defines regular and project employees.
*   **Policy Instruction No. 20:**  Provides guidelines for determining project employment in the construction industry.
*   ***Abuan v. AG&P***: Prior case involving similar facts and issues with AG&P, establishing precedent for project employment status.
*   ***Caramol v. NLRC***: Distinguished this case from Caramol where an employee engaged in only one type of work was held to be a regular employee
*   ***Samson v. NLRC***: Distinguished this case from Samson where an employee had been a rigger for more than 20 years and held to be a regular employee.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65, ยง1** Sets the rules for filling for Certiorari

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The finding that petitioners worked in various capacities. It might be possible to argue that the various capacities were only due to the nature of the project work, and not sufficient to classify them as project employees.

**Note:** It is important to note that the lack of detail in the available record regarding the specific duties of the workers makes a comprehensive analysis difficult. Reviewing the full records, including the service records and employment contracts, is crucial for a more accurate assessment.
