## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Sia, Jr.*, G.R. No. 262603 (April 15, 2024)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision resolving an appeal from a CA decision affirming the RTC conviction of Nelson Sia, Jr. for Murder and Attempted Murder.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Conviction Upheld:** The Supreme Court **denied** Sia's appeal, upholding his conviction for both Murder (Art. 248, RPC) for the death of Hector Iniaki Lontoc, Jr., and Attempted Murder (Art. 248 in relation to Art. 51, RPC) for the injuries to Jerome Sumulong.
*   **Identification:** SC affirmed the lower courts' findings that witnesses positively identified Sia as the shooter, citing favorable lighting conditions from a street light. The Court cited *People v. Estrada, 440 Phil. 317 (2002)*, and similar cases establishing that illumination from a street light, lamp post, kerosene or wick lamp, moonlight, starlight, flashlight, torch, and lighting from a nearby establishment, have all been deemed sufficient for visibility and identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime charged against him or her.
*   **Treachery:** SC held that treachery (Art. 14, RPC) was properly established as a qualifying circumstance for both crimes.
    *   It distinguished *People v. Nemeria, 312 Phil. 531 (1995)* and *People v. Germina, 352 Phil. 754 (1998)*, clarifying that their holdings against finding treachery were based on the victims' awareness of an impending attack, not merely the presence of other people. The Court held that in contrast to Germina and Nemeria, the Court, in People v. Costelo appreciated the presence of treachery notwithstanding the fact that the murder was committed in a densely populated area in Taguig City because the attack was so sudden that the victim was deprived of any chance to defend herself or escape.
    *   The Court emphasized that treachery focused on the victim's inability to defend themselves, as enshrined in Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code.
    *   The court cited *People v. Llobera, 765 Phil. 897 (2015)* and similar cases, noting the treacherous mode was employed through Sia's sudden appearance from behind PO1 Guzman, without warning.
*   **Sufficiency of Information:** Sia waived any objection to the Informations' lack of factual averments regarding treachery by failing to file a Motion to Quash or a Bill of Particulars before pleading. This invokes *People v. Solar, 858 Phil. 884 (2019)*, which states that the accused is deemed to have waived such objection.
*   **Intent to Kill:** Intent to kill for the Attempted Murder was established through Sia's use of a deadly weapon and repeated firing of shots, even though Jerome's injury was not fatal. The court cited *Anisco v. People, 890 Phil. 772 (2020)*, indicating that continuous firing of a gun at the victim shows intent to kill.
*   **Damages Modified:** The Supreme Court **modified** the CA's decision, reducing temperate damages awarded to Jerome from PHP 50,000.00 to PHP 20,000.00.
    *   The Supreme Court held that the CA erred in awarding 50,000 to Jerome as temperate damages since the standard temperate damages in Jugueta pertain to burial and funeral expenses suffered following the victim's death
    *   The Court lowered the sum to reflect the medical expenses proven by receipts (PHP 1,942.10) and a reasonable estimate of lost income during recovery (PHP 15,000), citing *People v. Angeles, 859 Phil. 652 (2019)*, which limits temperate damages to the amount of the claimed pecuniary loss.
    *   The Court cited *Imperial v. Heirs of Spouses Bayaban, 841 Phil. 53 (2018)* in finding that temperate damages may be awarded if the victim claimed loss of income while recovering from an injury caused by the accused, but was unable to duly prove it with sufficient evidence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Sia is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua* for Murder.
*   Sia is obligated to serve an indeterminate sentence of four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day of *prision correccional*, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor*, as maximum, for Attempted Murder.
*   Sia is liable to pay:
    *   Heirs of Hector Iniaki Lontoc, Jr.: PHP 75,000.00 as civil indemnity, PHP 75,000.00 as moral damages, PHP 75,000.00 as exemplary damages, PHP 50,000.00 as temperate damages.
    *   Jerome Sumulong: PHP 25,000.00 as civil indemnity, PHP 25,000.00 as moral damages, PHP 25,000.00 as exemplary damages, PHP 20,000.00 as temperate damages.
*   All damages are subject to 6% interest *per annum* from finality until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Treachery Application:** While the SC upheld the treachery finding, its application in cases involving the presence of other individuals could be subject to further interpretation or challenge in future cases, depending on the specific factual circumstances.
*   **Temperate Damages Calculation:** The reduction of temperate damages highlights the importance of proper documentation of pecuniary losses. The court's reliance on *People v. Angeles, 859 Phil. 652 (2019)*, suggests a trend towards stricter scrutiny of unproven claims.
