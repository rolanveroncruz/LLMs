Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, focusing on key aspects relevant to a lawyer:

**Case:** *Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) vs. Olongapo Maintenance Services, Inc. (OMSI) and Triple Crown Services, Inc. (TCSI)* G.R. Nos. 146184-85, 161117, 167827, January 31, 2008

**Subject Matter:** Legality of awarding government service contracts without public bidding; proprietary of injunctive relief.

**Facts:** MIAA declined to renew janitorial service contracts with OMSI and TCSI upon their expiration (October 31, 1998), opting for negotiated contracts. OMSI and TCSI sought injunctive relief to prevent the termination and compel public bidding.  Multiple petitions and appeals ensued, involving questions of the propriety of injunctions, mandamus, and forum shopping.  MIAA eventually ceased contracting for these services, hiring personnel directly.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Public Bidding Requirement:** The Court reiterated the general rule requiring public bidding for government contracts for public services and procurement of supplies, material and equipment to ensure transparency and accountability and to minimize corruption.

*   **Executive Order 301 (EO 301):** Held that the exceptions to public bidding under Section 1 of EO 301 apply *only* to the *purchase* of supplies, materials, and equipment, *not* to contracts for public services such as janitorial services.  The court applied *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* to support this interpretation, citing *Kilosbayan, Incorporated v. Morato* G.R. No. 118910, July 17, 1995, 246 SCRA 540.

*   **Injunctions Improper:**  The Court ruled that the lower courts improperly issued mandatory preliminary injunctions extending the expired service contracts. Because the contracts had expired, OMSI and TCSI no longer had a clear legal right to continued service, and courts cannot force contract extensions. (*Bautista v. Barcelona*, 100 Phil. 1078 (1957)). Also MIAAâ€™s decision not to extend the service contracts of OMSI and TCSI is a valid exercise of management prerogative.

*   **RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act):**  Acknowledged that RA 9184, now the governing law on government procurement, continues to require public bidding but provides for alternative procurement methods (e.g., negotiated procurement) under specific circumstances (Section 53).

*   **Mootness:** The Court held that ordering MIAA to conduct a public bidding would be moot because MIAA had already decided to hire its own employees and not contract with outside services.

*   **Equal Protection Clause:** The Court acknowledged possible equal protection issues because MIAA and Gana are alleged to not have called for public bidding and not to have even accorded OMSI and TCSI the opportunity to submit their proposals in a public bidding.

*   **Forum Shopping:** The Court upheld the CA's finding that TCSI engaged in forum shopping by filing separate actions (contempt and mandamus) based on the same underlying facts and seeking the same relief (enforcement of the preliminary injunction). The elements of *litis pendentia* were met.

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   **Procurement Violations:** MIAA's attempted negotiated contract, as initially contemplated, violated the public bidding requirements under the then-governing laws (primarily EO 301).

*   **Discretion to give due course to the Petition:** Sec. 1 of Rule 65 clearly vests the CA the authority and discretion to give due course to the petitions before it or to dismiss them when they are not sufficient in form and substance, the required pleadings and documents are not attached to them, and no sworn certificate on non-forum shopping is submitted.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **EO 301:** Decentralizing Actions on Government Negotiated Contracts, Lease Contracts and Records Disposal.

*   **EO 903:** Providing for a Revision of Executive Order No. 778 Creating the Manila International Airport Authority.

*   **RA 9184:** Government Procurement Reform Act.

*   **Civil Code Arts. 1306 & 1308** On the mutuality and freedom of contracts.

*   ***Kilosbayan, Incorporated v. Morato***
    *   *Manila International Airport Authority v. Mabunay* G.R. No. 126151, January 20, 2000, 322 SCRA 760

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "supplies" in EO 301 and whether it extended to services. The Court definitively ruled that it did not.

**Outcomes/Dispositions:**

*   The Court *granted* MIAA's petitions regarding the improper injunctions, reversing the Court of Appeals and RTC orders that granted injunctive relief to OMSI and TCSI.

*   The Court *partly granted* MIAA's petition regarding the negotiated contract, declaring it null and void.  However, it held that because the contracts were eventually done through hiring of employees, public bidding was no longer warranted.

*   The Court *denied* TCSI's petition, affirming the Court of Appeals' finding of forum shopping.

**Implications:** This case clarifies the scope of the exceptions to public bidding under EO 301 (prior to its repeal by RA 9184) and reinforces the importance of adhering to public bidding requirements for government service contracts. It also serves as a reminder of the limitations on judicial power to compel contract extensions and the consequences of forum shopping.
