## Legal Document Summary: Manila Banking Corporation v. Bases Conversion and Development Authority (G.R. No. 230144)

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision, which reversed the RTC's order regarding the just compensation for TMBC's land expropriated by BCDA for the SCTEX project. The Supreme Court ultimately denies TMBC's petition, affirming the CA's decision.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Expropriation:** BCDA, under RA 7227, initiated expropriation proceedings against TMBC for a portion of its land for the SCTEX project. A writ of possession was issued.
*   **Just Compensation:** The core issue revolves around the determination of just compensation. The RTC initially determined a value, then reconsidered it. The CA reversed, setting a lower value.
*   **Standards for Assessment (RA 8974, Sec. 5):** The Supreme Court addresses the proper application of standards for assessing the value of land in expropriation cases under RA 8974, emphasizing that the classification of the land as agricultural at the time of taking is crucial, and that factors must be considered based on the state of the property at the time of taking, not based on speculation on future land value.
*   **Commissioner's Reports:** The Court scrutinized the reports of the appointed commissioners, discounting the report of one (Engr. Lansangan) because the report did not provide a sound basis for the valuation and relied on speculative reclassification.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** TMBC challenged the validity of BCDA's Motion for Reconsideration in the trial court due to lack of Notice of Hearing. However, the Supreme Court found that TMBC was still given opportunity to be heard through pleadings in response to the Motion for Reconsideration.
*   **Interest:** The applicable interest rate on the unpaid balance of the just compensation was also disputed. The Court aligned with prevailing jurisprudence, applying 12% per annum from the date of taking (November 21, 2003) until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until fully paid, in accordance with BSP-MB Circular No. 799 and *Nacar v. Gallery Frames*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **BCDA's Obligation:** BCDA is obligated to pay TMBC the balance of the just compensation, as fixed by the CA (P75 per square meter).
*   **Interest Payment:** BCDA is liable for interest on the unpaid balance as per the rates and periods determined by the Court (12% until June 30, 2013, then 6% thereafter).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Valuation Disputes:** Just compensation is a frequent subject of contention in expropriation cases. This case highlights the importance of relying on solid and actual data, existing at the time of the taking of the property.
*   **Procedural Issues:** Failure to include a notice of hearing may not be fatal if the adverse party is afforded an opportunity to be heard.

*   **RA 7227:** Created BCDA and granted it the power of eminent domain.
