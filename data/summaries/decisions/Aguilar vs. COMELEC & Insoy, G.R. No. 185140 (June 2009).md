## Legal Document Summary: Aguilar v. COMELEC and Insoy (G.R. No. 185140)

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Certiorari under Rules 64 and 65 challenging the COMELEC's dismissal of Aguilar's appeal in an election protest case filed by Insoy, Aguilar's opponent in the Barangay elections. The MTC initially ruled in favor of Insoy.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Appeal Fee Dispute:** The core issue is whether Aguilar's appeal should have been dismissed for failure to pay the correct appeal fee to the COMELEC. Aguilar paid the P1,000 appeal fee to the MTC as per A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC, but the COMELEC (First Division) dismissed the appeal for non-payment of the P3,200 appeal fee required by the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.
*   **COMELEC En Banc vs. Division Authority:** The Supreme Court highlights the COMELEC First Division's violation of Article IX-C, Section 3 of the Constitution and Rule 19 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, by resolving Aguilar's motion for reconsideration instead of elevating it to the COMELEC *en banc*. This is a critical error, rendering the COMELEC First Division's orders null and void. Citing *Soriano, Jr. v. Commission on Elections* (G.R. No. 164496-505), the court emphasizes that motions for reconsideration of COMELEC Division decisions must be resolved by the *en banc*.
*   **Application of COMELEC Resolution No. 8486:** The Supreme Court also addressed the proper application of COMELEC Resolution No. 8486, clarifying appeal fee payment procedures. While the COMELEC can dismiss an appeal for non-payment of the P3,200 fee, it should first direct the appellant to pay the additional fee, especially considering the confusing rules and the fact that Aguilar filed his appeal *before* the clarification was issued.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Aguilar:** Appellant; initially had the obligation to perfect his appeal by paying the correct appeal fees.
*   **COMELEC:** Obligated to follow constitutional procedures in resolving election disputes, specifically by referring motions for reconsideration to the *en banc*.
*   **MTC:** Obligated to transmit records to COMELEC upon perfection of appeal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Disenfranchisement:** The Supreme Court expresses concern that dismissing appeals on mere technicalities can frustrate the will of the electorate.
*   **Violation of Due Process:** The COMELEC First Division's actions violated Aguilar's right to have his motion for reconsideration properly considered by the full Commission.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article IX-A, Section 7:** Defines the Supreme Court's certiorari jurisdiction over COMELEC *en banc* decisions.
*   **Constitution, Article IX-C, Section 3:** Mandates that motions for reconsideration of COMELEC division decisions be decided by the COMELEC *en banc*.
*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 19, Sections 5 & 6:** Details the procedure for handling motions for reconsideration, requiring certification to the *en banc*.
*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 40, Section 18:** Provides discretion to the COMELEC (not a division) to dismiss an action for non-payment of fees.
*   **A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC (Rules of Procedure in Election Contests Before the Courts Involving Elective Municipal and Barangay Officials), Sections 8 & 9, Rule 14:** Outlines the procedure for appealing MTC decisions to the COMELEC.
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 8486:** Clarifies appeal fee payment procedures.
*   ***Soriano, Jr. v. Commission on Elections* (G.R. No. 164496-505):** Reinforces the rule that motions for reconsideration of COMELEC Division decisions must be elevated to the *en banc*.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The conflicting rules regarding appeal fees (A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC vs. COMELEC Rules of Procedure) created confusion, which was eventually addressed by COMELEC Resolution No. 8486. However, the *retroactive* application of this resolution was deemed unfair.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, **ANNULLING** the COMELEC First Division's orders and the Entry of Judgment, and **REMANDED** the case to the COMELEC First Division for disposition in accordance with the decision. This effectively revives Aguilar's appeal and requires the COMELEC to follow proper procedure in handling it.
