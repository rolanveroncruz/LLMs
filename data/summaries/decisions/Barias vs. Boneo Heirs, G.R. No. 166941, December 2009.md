**Legal Document Summary: Barias vs. Heirs of Boneo, G.R. No. 166941**

**Nature of Document:**  Decision of the Supreme Court in an unlawful detainer case.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Spouses Dennis and Divina Barias (occupants of the land).
*   **Respondents:** Heirs of Bartolome Boneo (registered owners of the land, represented by Juanita Volante Boneo).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Property in Dispute:** Portion of Lot No. 1086, Cad-483-D in Sta. Teresa, Malilipot, Albay, covered by OCT No. P-29864, issued based on a free patent granted to the Heirs of Bartolome Boneo.
*   **Respondents' Claim:** Petitioners were occupying the land by mere tolerance and refused to vacate after demand.
*   **Petitioners' Defense:** (1) Forum shopping due to a pending case involving the same property and Silvestra Boneo (predecessor-in-interest); (2) A Deed of Absolute Sale dated August 8, 1994, exists wherein Silvestra Bo Boneo sold a portion of the land to Carmen Bendicio-Belir, mother of Petitioner Divina Barias.
*   **Lower Courts' Rulings:**
    *   **MCTC:** Dismissed the case for forum shopping and upheld the validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale.
    *   **RTC:** Dismissed the appeal but did not find the respondents guilty of Forum Shopping.
    *   **CA:** Reversed the RTC, ruling that the respondents' Torrens Title (based on the free patent) has superior right to possess the property than petitioners' deed of sale from Silvestra Boneo.
* **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, denying petitioners' claim.

**Key Legal Issues and Reasoning:**

1.  **Forum Shopping:** The Supreme Court held that there was no forum shopping, distinguishing the unlawful detainer case from the pending case involving annulment of the deed of sale. The causes of action (unlawful possession vs. alleged fraud) and reliefs sought were different.
    *   *Relevant Case Law:* Cites *De Chavez v. Office of the Ombudsman, G.R. No. 168830-31*.
2.  **Superior Right of Possession:** The Court emphasized the well-established principle that a Torrens title holder has a superior right to possess the property, even against a prior deed of sale. The deed of sale from Silvestra does not defeat respondentsâ€™ superior right to possess the property.
    *   *Relevant Case Law:* Cites *Arambulo v. Gungab, G.R. No. 156581* and *Pascual v. Coronel, G.R. No. 159292*.
    *   The Court noted that the lower court was correct in using the motion for substitution that petitioners filed in CA-G.R. SP No. 62015 when deciding that petitioners merely stepped into the shoes of Silvestra Boneo.
3.  **Nature of Determination of Ownership:** The Court clarified that the determination of ownership in an ejectment case is only provisional and for the sole purpose of resolving the issue of possession. It does not prejudice the pending case for annulment of the deed of sale.

**Potential Risks and Considerations:**

*   **Annulment Case:** The outcome of the pending annulment case involving the deed of sale could potentially affect the long-term ownership of the disputed portion of the property.  If the deed of sale is found to be valid, the Petitioners may have a claim for ownership, though this decision affirms that their right to possess is subordinate to the Torrens title holders until such a determination is made.
*   **Collateral Attack:** The Court reiterated that a Torrens title cannot be collaterally attacked in an unlawful detainer case. This reinforces the strength of the Respondents' position regarding possession.
*   **Succession:** The court rejected the claim that respondents were successors in interest to Silvestra Boneo, as they were heirs of Bartolome Boneo who was not related to her.

**Statutory References:**

*   No specific statutes are directly cited beyond those implicitly related to land registration (Torrens system), ejectment proceedings, and unlawful detainer.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The motion for substitution petitioners filed in CA-G.R. SP No. 62015.
*   The main contention lies in the validity and effect of the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by Silvestra Boneo, which is the subject of a separate annulment case. The current decision only addresses possession, not definitive ownership.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The Spouses Barias (Petitioners) are obligated to vacate the portion of the property they occupy.
*   They are liable for the costs of the suit.
