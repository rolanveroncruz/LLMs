**Summary of PCI Travel Corporation vs. NLRC & NUBE-AMEXPEA/PCI Travel Employees Union (G.R. No. 154379)**

This Supreme Court case involves a petition for review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision dismissing PCI Travel's (Petitioner) certiorari petition on procedural grounds. The underlying issue is a labor dispute where the NUBE-AMEXPEA/PCI Travel Employees Union (Respondent) filed a complaint for unfair labor practice against PCI Travel, alleging the company was filling regular positions with contractual employees.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Labor Arbiter (LA) Decision:** The LA ruled in favor of the Union, declaring the contractual employees as regular employees and ordering PCI Travel to pay wage differentials, moral damages (P20,000 per employee), exemplary damages (P10,000 per employee), and attorney's fees (10% of the total award).
*   **NLRC Decision:** Affirmed the LA's decision with modification, deleting the awards for moral and exemplary damages due to a lack of sufficient basis. The NLRC concurred with the LA that PCI Travel had waived its opportunity to submit a position paper, and deemed the allegations admitted due to a failure to rebut.
*   **CA Decision:** Dismissed PCI Travel's petition for certiorari on procedural grounds, specifically the lack of proper authorization for the corporation president (Elizabeth Legarda) to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping. The CA held that a board resolution or secretary's certificate was required.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, PCI Travel faced significant monetary liabilities for wage differentials, damages, and attorney's fees, as determined by the LA. The NLRC removed the damages liability. The reinstatement of the case before the CA leaves the liability for wage differentials and attorney's fees potentially still relevant.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Unfair Labor Practice Finding:** The primary risk is the finding of unfair labor practice, which could lead to further legal challenges and potential penalties.
*   **Regularization of Employees:** The declaration of the contractual employees as regular could significantly impact PCI Travel's labor costs and management flexibility.
*   **Back Wages:** The potential for substantial back wage payments to the employees from the date of their employment is a major financial risk.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code, Sections 23 & 25:**  Cited regarding the exercise of corporate powers by the Board of Directors.
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Discussed in the context of certiorari petitions and their formal requirements.
*   **Cagayan Valley Drug Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (G.R. No. 151413):** This case is critical, as it establishes that the President of a corporation generally possesses the authority to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping without a specific board resolution.
*   **Various cases related to authority to sign verification and certification:** *Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority v. CA*, *Pfizer v. Galan*, *Novelty Philippines, Inc. v. CA*, and *Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company v. WMC Resources International Pty. Ltd*.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Authorization of Corporate President:** The CA's initial reliance on the lack of a board resolution for the president to sign the verification was ultimately overturned by the SC based on jurisprudence recognizing the inherent authority of the president in this context. This demonstrates a potential area for future procedural challenges.
*   **"Waiver" of Opportunity to Submit Position Paper:**  The labor tribunals' interpretation that PCI Travel waived its opportunity to submit a position paper (and therefore failed to rebut the Union's claims) is a critical point of contention. PCI Travel argues it was denied due process.

**Outcome and Remand:**

The Supreme Court granted the petition, set aside the CA resolutions, and remanded the case to the CA for resolution on the merits. This means the CA must now consider PCI Travel's arguments regarding the alleged grave abuse of discretion by the labor tribunals in denying it the opportunity to present its case and make an informed assessment on the independent contractor status of those working on the PCI Travel premises.
