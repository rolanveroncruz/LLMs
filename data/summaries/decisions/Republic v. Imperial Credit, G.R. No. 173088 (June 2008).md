**Case Summary: *Republic of the Philippines v. Imperial Credit Corporation*, G.R. No. 173088, June 25, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's grant of land registration to Imperial Credit Corporation (ICC).

**Key Issue:** Whether ICC sufficiently proved its right to land registration under Section 14 of P.D. No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree).

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and dismissed ICC's application.  ICC failed to prove open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession since June 12, 1945, as required by Sec. 14(1) of P.D. 1529 and Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act (CA 141) as amended by P.D. 1073.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Sec. 14(1), P.D. 1529:**  Applicants must demonstrate open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of alienable and disposable public land under a *bona fide* claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier. This is the basis of ICC's application but the Court finds evidence lacking regarding possession by ICC's predecessor-in-interest, Jose Tajon, before 1966.
*   **CENRO Certification:**  While the certification proves the land's alienability, it *does not* prove possession requirements. *Republic v. San Lorenzo Development Corporation* is cited as authority that a CENRO certification alone is insufficient proof of possession.
*   **Possession Requirements:**  The Court reiterates the definition of "open," "continuous," "exclusive," and "notorious" possession, citing *Director of Lands v. Intermediate Appellate Court*.  The Court finds that ICCâ€™s evidence, consisting primarily of testimony from its caretaker and attorney-in-fact, is insufficient. The failure to present adjacent landowners as witnesses is highlighted. Also, the single, belated tax declaration filed in 1993 is insufficient.
*   **Sec. 14(2), P.D. 1529 (Acquisitive Prescription):**  The CA erred in applying Sec. 14(2), which pertains to private lands acquired through prescription.  Since the land was formerly public land, the conditions of Sec. 14(1) must be met. While prescription could convert public land to private, ICC failed to prove the required 30 years of uninterrupted adverse possession for extraordinary prescription.
*   **Sec. 14(4), P.D. 1529:**  Inapplicable because the land acquisition method falls directly under Sec. 14(1) as land acquired by purchase from the public domain.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Sec. 14:** Central to the dispute, outlining who may apply for land registration.
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 141 (Public Land Act), Sec. 48(b) (as amended by R.A. 1942 & P.D. 1073):** Specifies the requirements for confirmation of imperfect titles, particularly the June 12, 1945, possession date.
*   **P.D. 1073, Sec. 4:** Reiterates the June 12, 1945, date for possession.
*   ***Republic v. San Lorenzo Development Corporation*:**  Establishes that CENRO certification only proves alienability, not possession.
*   ***Director of Lands v. Intermediate Appellate Court*:**  Defines the elements of possession (open, continuous, exclusive, notorious).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The decision emphasizes the strict requirements for proving possession since June 12, 1945, creating a high evidentiary bar for applicants seeking land registration under Sec. 14(1) of P.D. 1529.
*   The case highlights the difficulty in proving possession through testimonial evidence alone, especially without corroboration from disinterested parties like adjacent landowners.
*   The single, belated tax declaration held against ICC suggests a heightened scrutiny of tax compliance as evidence of bona fide claim of ownership.
*   The rejection of CA's application of Sec. 14(2) reinforces the principle that Sec. 14(1) applies when registering originally public land.

**Conclusion:** This case serves as a crucial reminder that land registration applicants relying on possession since June 12, 1945, must present robust and convincing evidence demonstrating compliance with all the statutory requirements. Reliance solely on CENRO certifications, bare testimonial evidence, or belated tax declarations is unlikely to succeed.
