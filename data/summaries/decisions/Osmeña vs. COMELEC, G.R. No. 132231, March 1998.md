**Case Summary: *Osmeña v. COMELEC*, 351 Phil. 692 (1998)**

**Nature of the Document:**
This is a Supreme Court decision upholding the constitutionality of Section 11(b) of Republic Act No. 6646 (Electoral Reforms Law of 1987), which prohibits mass media from selling or donating print space or airtime for campaign or other political purposes, except to the Commission on Elections (COMELEC).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 11(b) of R.A. 6646:** Prohibits mass media from selling or donating print space or airtime for political campaign purposes, except to the COMELEC.
*   **Sections 90 and 92 of the Omnibus Election Code:** Mandates the COMELEC to procure "COMELEC space" in newspapers and "COMELEC time" on radio and television, and to allocate these equally and impartially among all candidates.

**Key Obligations:**

*   Mass media is prohibited from selling or donating space/time for political ads directly to candidates.
*   COMELEC must procure and allocate media space and time to candidates.
*   Candidates are limited to utilizing COMELEC-provided space and time for media advertising.

**Liabilities:**

*   Violation of Section 11(b) by media outlets or individuals making use of mass media is unlawful and likely criminal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Challenges to COMELEC's allocation procedures:** Disputes may arise regarding the fairness and impartiality of COMELEC's allocation of media space and time.
*   **Constitutional Challenges:** There remains potential for ongoing challenges to the law's constitutionality, as seen with the dissenting opinions within this ruling.
*   **Enforcement Issues:** Difficulties in monitoring and enforcing the ban on indirect political advertising or disguised forms of support.
*   **Disadvantage for Lesser-Known Candidates:** The ban may inadvertently benefit established candidates with existing name recognition, limiting opportunities for lesser-known candidates to gain visibility.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***National Press Club v. COMELEC*** (207 SCRA 1 (1992)): Previously upheld the constitutionality of Section 11(b). *Osmeña v. COMELEC* reaffirms this ruling.
*   ***Adiong v. COMELEC*** (207 SCRA 712 (1992)): Distinguished, as the restrictions in *Adiong* were considered overly broad and lacked a substantial government interest.
*   ***Gonzales v. COMELEC*** (27 SCRA 835 (1969)) and ***Valmonte v. COMELEC*** (G.R. No. 73551, Feb. 11, 1988): Cited as precedents supporting the state's power to regulate campaigning.
*   ***Buckley v. Valeo*** (424 U.S. 1 (1976)): Dissenting opinions cite this case as persuasive in arguing against restrictions on campaign spending, though the majority distinguishes it.
*   ***Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce*** (494 US 652 (1990)): U.S. Case modifying absolute support of free speech related to campaign expenditure.

**Statutory References:**

*   R.A. No. 6646 (Electoral Reforms Law of 1987), Section 11(b)
*   Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 (Omnibus Election Code), Sections 90 and 92
*   R.A. No. 7166

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "campaign or other political purposes":** Lacks clarity, potentially leading to disputes over whether certain media activities fall within the prohibited scope.
*   **Effectiveness of "COMELEC space" and "COMELEC time":** Dissenting justices question the adequacy and effectiveness of COMELEC-provided media access as a substitute for direct advertising.

**Overall Risk Assessment:**
Upholds the existing ban on political advertising in the traditional sense. Ongoing challenges related to constitutionality of the ban is unlikely to succeed unless a change in factual circumstances.
