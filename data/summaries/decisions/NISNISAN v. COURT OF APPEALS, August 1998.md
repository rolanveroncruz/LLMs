## Legal Document Summary: *Nisnisan v. Court of Appeals*

**Case Citation:** 355 Phil. 605 (G.R. No. 126425, August 12, 1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's dismissal of the petitioners’ complaint for reinstatement of tenancy.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Core Issue:** Whether Spouses Policarpio and Erlinda Nisnisan are agricultural tenants entitled to reinstatement after the land they cultivated was sold to Spouses Mancera. The central point of contention is whether the Nisnisans voluntarily surrendered their tenancy rights.
*   **Prior Dealings:** Gavino Nisnisan (father of Policarpio) sold a portion of his land, including the portion tenanted by Policarpio, to the Manceras.
*   **Leasehold Tenancy Contract:** A written contract ("Panagsabutan Sa Abang Sa Yuta") dated April 1, 1976, exists between Gavino and Policarpio, outlining a leasehold tenancy with a specific sharing arrangement. This contract is crucial evidence.
*   **Affidavit of Non-Tenancy:** Gavino Nisnisan executed an affidavit stating the land was *not* tenanted (entered in OCT). The lower courts relied on this, but the Supreme Court deemed it non-conclusive and self-serving. Reference is made to *Cuaño vs. Court of Appeals*, 237 SCRA 125 (1994), regarding the non-binding nature of MAR certifications.
*   **Voluntary Surrender:** The Manceras claimed the Nisnisans voluntarily surrendered their landholding, but presented no evidence to support this. The Supreme Court held that the burden of proving voluntary surrender rests on the landowner and mere allegations are insufficient. Cites Section 8 of Republic Act No. 3844, noting that such surrender requires written notice three months in advance.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Landowner's Obligation:** Respect tenant's security of tenure, as per Section 10 of RA 3844. The purchaser of land is subrogated to the obligations of the original lessor.
*   **Tenant's Right:** To be reinstated to their landholding.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Evidence:** The conflicting evidence - the leasehold contract versus the Affidavit of Non-Tenancy - created ambiguity. The Supreme Court ultimately prioritized the written contract and lack of evidence of voluntary surrender.
*   **Self-Serving Declarations:** Heavily relying on Gavino Nisnisan's affidavit of non-tenancy was a risky approach for the lower courts, given its potential bias and conflict with the written lease agreement.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code):** Sections 8 (Extinguishment of leasehold) and 10 (Security of Tenure) are central.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 27:** Mentioned in the complaint regarding security of tenure, although not explicitly used in the decision.
*    **PD 1508:** Used in complaint regarding a failure of settlement.
*   ***Cuaño vs. Court of Appeals*, 237 SCRA 125 (1994):**  Cited regarding the limited evidentiary weight of MAR certifications.
*   **Isidro vs. Court of Appeals, 228 SCRA 503 (1993):** Tenancy relationship elements.
*   **Talavera vs. Court of Appeals, 182 SCRA 782 (1990):** Re: "intention to surrender the landholding cannot be presumed, much less determined by mere implication."

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *modified* the Court of Appeals' decision, declaring Spouses Nisnisan to be tenants and reinstating their tenancy rights. The CA decision was affirmed in all other respects (likely referring to other causes of action in the original complaint, such as repurchase, which were not the subject of this particular appeal).

**Legal Precision Notes:**

*   The ruling emphasizes the importance of written contracts in establishing tenancy relationships and the strict requirements for proving voluntary surrender.
*   Self-serving affidavits, especially when contradicted by other evidence, are unlikely to prevail.
*   Purchasers of agricultural land take it subject to existing tenancies and the tenant's right to security of tenure.
