**Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Health Insurance Corporation v. The Court of Appeals and Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center***

**Case:** G.R. No. 176276, November 28, 2008

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Certiorari concerning the execution of a judgment awarding payment to Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center (CGHMC) by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (Philhealth) for medical services rendered.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Underlying Obligation:** Philhealth is obligated to pay CGHMC for Medicare claims for services rendered during 1989-1992 and 1998-1999, totaling P14,291,568.71.
*   **RA 7875 (National Health Insurance Act):** Establishes Philhealth and its responsibility to handle pending Medicare claims.
*   **Final Judgment:** A CA decision (CA-G.R. SP No. 59294) ordering payment to CGHMC was affirmed by the Supreme Court (G.R. No. 163123), although the dispositive portion of the SC decision only mentioned the 1989-1992 period and omitted 1998-1999.
*   **Execution Order:** The CA granted CGHMC's Motion for Execution. The initial resolution included a condition for the submission of pertinent documents for processing the payments.
*   **Modified Execution Order:** The CA later *modified* the execution order, removing the condition for document submission, based on the absence of such a condition in the SC decision.

**Liabilities:**

*   Philhealth is liable for the full amount of P14,291,568.71, encompassing the claims for both periods (1989-1992 and 1998-1999).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in SC Dispositive Portion:** The primary legal issue revolves around the discrepancy between the body of the SC decision (which affirms the CA's award covering both periods) and the dispositive portion (which initially mentioned only 1989-1992).
*   **Philhealth's Argument:** Philhealth argued that the CA modified a final and executory judgment by including the 1998-1999 claims in the execution order, which was omitted from the dispositive portion of the SC ruling.
*   **Risk:** Potential challenges to future execution or enforcement actions based on the arguments of finality and impermissible modification of judgment.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7875:** An Act Instituting a National Health Insurance Program for All Filipinos and Establishing the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation.
*   **Doctrine of Finality of Judgment:** Cited by Philhealth, arguing that a final judgment cannot be amended. The SC distinguishes this by clarifying an *inadvertent omission* rather than modifying substance.
*   **Insular Life Assurance Company, Ltd. v. Toyota Bel Air (G.R. No. 137884, March 28, 2008):**  Established that a court can resort to the pleadings, findings of fact, and conclusions of law within the body of the decision to clarify any ambiguities or inadvertent omissions in the dispositive portion of the judgment.
*   **Locsin, et al. v. Paredes (63 Phil. 87 (1963)):** The Court allowed a judgment to be clarified by supplying an inadvertently omitted word which changed the literal import of the original phraseology.
*   **Castelo v. Court of Appeals, 314 Phil. 1 (1995).** Used to justify how inadvertent errors can be corrected.

**Court's Ruling (Summary):**

The Supreme Court *dismissed* Philhealth's petition, *affirming* the CA's resolutions. The Court held that the omission of the 1998-1999 period in the SC's dispositive portion was a *typographical error* and clarified that the CA rightfully resorted to the body of the decision to rectify the ambiguity. The Court emphasized that the obligation covers both periods and that the final judgment encompasses the full amount of P14,291,568.71.
The deletion of the conditions related to pertinent documents was also deemed proper because that was not part of the original ruling.

**Analysis for Lawyer:**

This case underscores the importance of meticulously scrutinizing both the dispositive portion and the body of a judgment. While the dispositive portion is typically controlling, this case confirms that unintentional omissions or clerical errors can be corrected by reference to the reasoning and findings within the decision itself. Philhealth's reliance on the doctrine of finality was ultimately unsuccessful, highlighting the exception for clarifying, not substantively altering, a judgment to reflect its true intent. The SC views the case as a clear example of the necessity of avoiding delaying tactics.
