**Case Summary: *Laceda v. Limena and COMELEC*, G.R. No. 182867 (2008)**

**Nature:** Resolution denying a motion for reconsideration of a petition for certiorari concerning the COMELEC's disqualification of a candidate for Punong Barangay based on the three-term limit.

**Facts:** Roberto Laceda, Sr. was a candidate for Punong Barangay. Randy Limena filed a petition to disqualify Laceda, arguing he had already served three consecutive terms as Punong Barangay (1994, 1997, 2002), violating Section 2 of RA 9164 (three-term limit). Laceda admitted serving three terms but argued that his third term was in a new political unit (Sorsogon City, after the merger of the municipalities of Sorsogon and Bacon), thus entitling him to run for two more terms. He also argued that RA 9164 should not apply as it violates his vested right to run.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied the motion for reconsideration, affirming the COMELEC's disqualification of Laceda.

**Key Provisions and Legal Issues:**

*   **Section 2 of RA 9164:** Imposes a three-term limit on barangay elective officials.
*   **Three-Term Limit:** The Court applied the two-prong test from *Lonzanida v. COMELEC*: (1) elected for three consecutive terms in the same local government post and (2) fully served those three terms.
*   **Effect of Political Unit Reorganization (RA 8806):** Laceda argued the creation of Sorsogon City created a new political unit. The Court rejected this, holding that the *territorial jurisdiction* of Barangay Panlayaan remained the same.
*   **Continuity of Terms:** The Court cited *Latasa v. COMELEC* to support the holding that the term limit applies even when the municipality is converted into a city *without interruption* of the term.
*   **"Vested Right" Argument:** Laceda's argument that RA 9164 violates his vested right to run was implicitly rejected.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Laceda is prohibited from running for Punong Barangay due to the three-term limit under RA 9164.

**Potential Risks:**

*   This case reinforces the strict interpretation of the three-term limit, even in situations involving political unit reorganization, potentially impacting future elections.
*   The reliance on *Latasa* suggests a broad application of the continuity principle, irrespective of how substantial changes to the local government might be.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9164, Section 2:** The three-term limit statute.
*   **RA 8806:** Law creating Sorsogon City.
*   **Lonzanida v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 135150 (1999):** Established the two-prong test for applying the three-term limit.
*   **Latasa v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 154829 (2003):**  Cited for the continuity of terms principle when a municipality is converted into a city.
*   **Local Government Code (RA 7160, Section 43):** Mentioned as the basis of RA 9164.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Court's definition of "same local government post" in the context of territorial jurisdiction is somewhat ambiguous. A more detailed analysis of the powers and duties, inhabitants, barangay make up, if they had been changed.
*   The decision doesn't comprehensively address the "vested rights" argument.
