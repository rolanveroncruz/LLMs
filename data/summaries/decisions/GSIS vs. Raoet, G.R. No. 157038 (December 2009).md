## Legal Document Summary: GSIS vs. Raoet

**Case:** G.R. No. 157038, December 23, 2009 (623 Phil. 690)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Government Service Insurance System (GSIS)
*   **Respondent:** Jean E. Raoet (Widow of Francisco M. Raoet)

**Issue:** Whether the death of Francisco Raoet due to Bleeding Peptic Ulcer Disease, which resulted in cardiac arrest, is compensable under P.D. 626 (Employees' Compensation Law), as amended.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied the GSIS petition, affirming the CA decision granting respondent's claim for income benefits. The SC found the death compensable.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **P.D. 626 (Employees' Compensation Law, as amended):** Governs the compensability of work-related illnesses and death.
*   **Section 1 (b), Rule III of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation:** Defines compensable sickness as either a listed occupational disease or an illness where the risk of contracting it is increased by working conditions.
*   **Annex "A" of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation:** Lists occupational diseases. (Peptic ulcer included under specific conditions).
*   **ECC Resolution No. 1676 (January 29, 1981):** Specifically designates peptic ulcer as a compensable disease under Annex "A" if the occupation involves prolonged emotional or physical stress.
*   **GSIS Obligation:** To pay income benefits to eligible claimants under P.D. 626.
*   **Government Guarantee (Article 184 of the Labor Code):** Republic of the Philippines guarantees benefits under P.D. 626 and accepts responsibility for the solvency of the State Insurance Fund.

**Liabilities:**

*   **GSIS Liability:** To pay death benefits to the respondent.

**Reasoning:**

*   The SC held that the death certificate, a public document, is prima facie evidence of the cause of death (cardiac arrest, antecedent cause of acute massive hemorrhage, underlying cause of bleeding peptic ulcer). *[Philippine American Life Insurance Company v. CA, 398 Phil. 559 (2000); People v. Datun, 338 Phil. 884 (1997)]*
*   While the CA incorrectly focused solely on cardiac arrest, the SC correctly viewed the underlying cause as peptic ulcer.
*   The SC recognized that **Peptic ulcer** is compensable if linked to prolonged emotional or physical stress (ECC Resolution No. 1676).
*   The SC determined that Francisco's job as Engineer A at NIA involved significant responsibility and stress. The fact that GSIS already awarded disability benefits for hypertension and coronary artery disease is proof of work related health issues. *[La O v. Employees' Compensation Commission, 186 Phil. 535 (1980); Manila Railroad Co. v. Workmen's Compensation Commission, 120 Phil. 944 (1964)]*
*   The SC emphasized the principle that employment need not be the sole factor, a reasonable work-connection is sufficient. *[GSIS v. Vicencio, G.R. No. 176832, May 21, 2009]*
*   P.D. 626 is social legislation that should be liberally construed in favor of labor. *[Biscarra v. Republic, 184 Phil. 209, 239-240 (1980)]*
*   The solvency of the State Insurance Fund is guaranteed by the government (Article 184 of the Labor Code).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in "Prolonged Emotional or Physical Stress":** The precise definition of "prolonged emotional or physical stress" remains somewhat subjective and case-dependent.
*   **Burden of Proof:** While the death certificate provides prima facie evidence, the claimant still bears the burden to show the employment contributed, even to a small degree, to the development of the compensable disease.
*   **Financial Strain on the State Insurance Fund:** While the government guarantees solvency, continued liberal interpretation of compensability rules could place a strain on the fund. GSIS argued this point unsuccessfully.

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 626 (P.D. 626)
*   Labor Code, Article 184
*   Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation, Section 1(b), Rule III
*   Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation, Annex "A"

**Case Law References:**

*   Philippine American Life Insurance Company v. CA, 398 Phil. 559 (2000)
*   People v. Datun, 338 Phil. 884 (1997)
*   GSIS v. Vicencio, G.R. No. 176832, May 21, 2009
*   La O v. Employees' Compensation Commission, 186 Phil. 535 (1980)
*   Manila Railroad Co. v. Workmen's Compensation Commission, 120 Phil. 944 (1964)
*   Biscarra v. Republic, 184 Phil. 209, 239-240 (1980)

**Conclusion:**

This case reinforces the liberal interpretation of P.D. 626 in favor of employees and highlights the compensability of peptic ulcer when causally linked to work-related stress. The ruling emphasizes the importance of death certificates as evidence and underscores the government's commitment to ensuring the solvency of the State Insurance Fund.
