## Legal Document Summary: *Barriga v. Sandiganbayan* (G.R. Nos. 179307-09)

**Document Type:** Resolution by the Supreme Court (Third Division) denying a Motion to Resolve a Motion for Reconsideration.

**Case Summary:** The Petitioner, Dinah C. Barriga, sought resolution on the merits of her Petition for Certiorari, arguing the Sandiganbayan lacked jurisdiction to try her criminal cases because the Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed the administrative case based on the same facts, citing *Pajaro v. Sandiganbayan* (160 SCRA 763). The Supreme Court (SC) denied the motion.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **SC Denies Reconsideration:** The SC denied Barriga's motion, treating it as a third, unauthorized motion for reconsideration.
*   **Minute Resolutions as Adjudication:** The SC affirmed that denial of a petition via minute resolution constitutes an adjudication on the merits, citing *Smith Bell & Co. v. CA* (274 Phil. 472) and *Komatsu Industries v. CA* (352 Phil. 440). This rebuts Barriga's contention that her case was not resolved on its merits.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Prosecution:** Barriga remains subject to criminal prosecution before the Sandiganbayan.
*   **Final & Executory:** The SC declared the resolution immediately final and executory, barring further pleadings.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   ***Pajaro v. Sandiganbayan* (160 SCRA 763):** Petitioner relied heavily on this case, which held that dismissal of an administrative case by the CA based on the same facts as a criminal case before the Sandiganbayan divested the latter of jurisdiction. The SC rejected this reliance.
*   **PD No. 1606, as amended by RA No. 8249:** The SC cites this to emphasize that the Sandiganbayan is now a special court of the same level as the Court of Appeals, possessing all the inherent powers of a court of justice. Effectively overruling the precedent established in *Pajaro*.
*   ***Smith Bell & Co. v. CA* (274 Phil. 472) & *Komatsu Industries v. CA* (352 Phil. 440):**  Cited to support the SC's practice of using minute resolutions for denial and the interpretation of such resolutions as judgements.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Applicability of *Pajaro*:** The central contention revolved around whether *Pajaro v. Sandiganbayan* was controlling precedent. The SC explicitly stated it was not, citing the change in Sandiganbayan's status and powers via RA 8249.
*   **Dismissal of Administrative Case:** Barriga argued the CA dismissed the administrative case, removing the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction. The SC found that the CA merely modified its decision regarding the Ombudsman's authority to suspend, not dismissing the administrative case entirely.

**Analysis for Lawyer:**

This resolution confirms that the SC is not bound by *Pajaro v. Sandiganbayan* in cases where RA 8249's upgrade of the Sandiganbayan's status is relevant. The key takeaway is the finality of the SC's decision and the lack of avenues for further appeal. The argument regarding CA's dismissal of the administrative aspect was also unsuccessful, as the court found no outright dismissal. There are no further apparent legal strategies within this specific case.
