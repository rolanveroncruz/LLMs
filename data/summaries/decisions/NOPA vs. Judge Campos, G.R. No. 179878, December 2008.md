Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Negros Oriental Planters Association, Inc. (NOPA) vs. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC-Negros Occidental, Branch 52, Bacolod City, and Aniceto Manojo Campos* (G.R. No. 179878, December 24, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking reversal of Court of Appeals Resolutions dismissing NOPA's Petition for Certiorari.

**Background:**

*   Aniceto Manojo Campos filed a Complaint for Breach of Contract with Damages (Civil Case No. 99-10773) against NOPA in RTC Negros Occidental.
*   Campos alleged breach of Molasses Sales Agreements, claiming full payment but partial delivery due to quality dispute.
*   NOPA filed a Motion to Dismiss after six years, alleging Campos deliberately underpaid filing fees by underestimating actual damages in his Complaint. The RTC denied NOPA's Motion to Dismiss

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **Docket Fees & Jurisdiction:** NOPA argues the RTC lacked jurisdiction due to Campos' alleged underpayment of docket fees, citing *Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals* (149 SCRA 562).
2.  **Verification Requirements:** The CA dismissed NOPA's Petition for Certiorari for failure to properly verify the petition (failing to state allegations were "based on authentic records" per Rule 7, Section 4) and failure to append relevant documents (Rule 65, Section 1).
3.  **Substantial Compliance:** NOPA argued substantial compliance with procedural rules and sought relaxation of technicalities, but the CA rejected this, noting the Amended Petition was filed late.
4.  **Discretion of Court of Appeals:** The Supreme Court considered whether the CA abused its discretion in denying NOPA's Motion for Reconsideration and refusing to allow the amendment of the verification.

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   **Campos:** Obligation to pay correct docket fees. Potential liability for breach of contract if the court finds in his favor.
*   **NOPA:** Obligation to comply with procedural rules for filing petitions, including proper verification and submission of relevant documents. Potential liability for breach of contract.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **NOPA:** Dismissal of Petition for Certiorari means the RTC case proceeds. NOPA risks being found liable for breach of contract.
*   **Campos:** Potential for delayed resolution of the case due to procedural challenges. Risk of dismissal if the docket fee issue remains unresolved.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 7, Section 4 of the Rules of Civil Procedure (Verification):** Amended by A.M. No. 00-2-10-SC, requiring verification based on "personal knowledge or based on authentic records."
*   **Rule 65, Section 1 of the Rules of Civil Procedure (Certiorari):**  Requires a verified petition with certified copies of judgments/orders and relevant pleadings.
*   ***Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals* (149 SCRA 562):**  Court acquires jurisdiction only upon payment of prescribed docket fee.  Cited by NOPA.
*   ***Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. (SIOL) v. Asuncion* (170 SCRA 274):** Modified *Manchester*, allowing payment of fees within a reasonable time if there is no deliberate intent to defraud.  Cited by RTC and affirmed by Supreme Court.
*   ***United Overseas Bank (formerly Westmont Bank) v. Ros* (529 SCRA 334):** Distinguished *Manchester*, emphasizing the lack of deliberate intent to defraud.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Deliberate Intent to Defraud":**  Whether Campos deliberately omitted information to underpay docket fees is a key point of contention. The court found the omission was small (5.2%) and Campos showed a willingness to pay additional fees if required.
*   **Discretion of Appellate Court:** The scope of appellate review regarding the lower court's discretionary rulings is debatable. The court emphasized that the appellate court would not review the action unless there was "inconsiderate action" or the exercise of mere "arbitrary will."

**Supreme Court Holding:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' dismissal of NOPA's Petition for Certiorari. The Court held that the CA did not abuse its discretion in finding NOPA's verification inadequate and the procedural deficiencies were not excused.  The Court also found that even if the procedural issues were overlooked, NOPA's substantive argument regarding underpaid docket fees failed because Campos showed no deliberate intent to defraud the court. The *Sun Insurance* doctrine applied, and dismissal was not warranted.
