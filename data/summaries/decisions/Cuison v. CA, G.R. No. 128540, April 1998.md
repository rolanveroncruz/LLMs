## Legal Document Summary: *Eduardo Cuison vs. Court of Appeals and the People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 128540)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals decision which set aside the RTC's resolution and ordered the trial court to promulgate the decision sentencing the accused to imprisonment.

**Key Issue:** Whether the promulgation of only the civil indemnity portion of a criminal decision bars the subsequent promulgation of the imprisonment sentence, violating double jeopardy.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the Court of Appeals' decision.  Promulgation of only part of the decision (civil indemnity) does not bar subsequent promulgation of the other part (criminal accountability).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Trial Court Obligation:** To promulgate the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the conviction and sentencing the accused to imprisonment.
*   **No Double Jeopardy:**  The initial promulgation of the civil indemnity only was incomplete and did not constitute a valid termination of the case, therefore, subsequent promulgation of imprisonment sentence does not constitute double jeopardy.

**Liabilities:**

*   Accused Eduardo Cuison is liable to serve the imprisonment sentence as originally imposed by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals. He must also pay double costs.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement Challenges:** Potential resistance from the accused.
*   **Further Litigation:** Accused may seek further legal remedies, though unlikely to succeed given the Supreme Court's affirmation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Certiorari and Mandamus. Specifically, Section 1 (Certiorari) and Section 3 (Mandamus).
*   **Section 1, Rule 111, Rules of Court:** A criminal prosecution includes a civil action for recovery of indemnity.
*   **People vs. Puno, 208 SCRA 550, 557, May 8, 1992; People vs. Asuncion, 208 SCRA 231, 239, April 22, 1992; Gorion vs. Regional Trial Court of Cebu, Br. 17, 213 SCRA 138, 148, August 31, 1992; and Martinez vs. Court of Appeals, 237 SCRA 575, 581, October 13, 1994:** Elements of double jeopardy.
*   **People vs. Hernando; Ramos vs. Hodges; Republic vs. Court of Appeals:** Distinguished as not applicable because the lower court's proceedings in those cases were not void.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals' original decision (July 30, 1991) lacked explicit reaffirmation of the imprisonment sentence, leading to the initial ambiguity. This was later clarified by the CA.
*    The trial court judge argued that another promulgation can no longer be legally feasible if the constitutional right of the accused against double jeopardy will not be violated, this was overruled by the higher court as the original ruling was an affirmation of the decision of the lower court.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Supreme Court correctly applied the principle that double jeopardy does not attach when the first proceeding was incomplete and void due to grave abuse of discretion. The trial court judge's refusal to promulgate the full CA decision (including imprisonment) constituted a grave abuse of discretion, effectively nullifying the initial promulgation of only the civil aspect.

**Recommendations:**

*   Ensure immediate execution of the imprisonment sentence.
*   Anticipate and address any potential legal challenges from the accused based on the double jeopardy argument, reiterating the Supreme Court's clear ruling.
