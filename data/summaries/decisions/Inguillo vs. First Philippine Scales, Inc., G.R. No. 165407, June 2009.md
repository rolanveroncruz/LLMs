## Legal Document Summary: Inguillo vs. First Philippine Scales, Inc.

**Case:** *Inguillo and Bergante vs. First Philippine Scales, Inc.*, G.R. No. 165407, June 05, 2009 (606 Phil. 464)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision upholding the NLRC ruling that the petitioners were validly dismissed under a Union Security Clause.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Union Security Clause (CBA Article II):** Requires all bona fide union members to maintain membership with FPSILU as a condition of continued employment. It outlines specific causes for suspension or dismissal by the Union, including disloyalty, joining rival unions, and acts derogatory to the Union.
*   **Termination for Disloyalty:** FPSILU recommended the termination of Inguillo and Bergante for joining NLM-KATIPUNAN, a rival union, and other alleged acts detrimental to FPSILU and FPSI.
*   **CBA Ratification:** Petitioners signed the document ratifying the CBA.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employees:** Maintain union membership during the CBA's lifetime.
*   **Employer (FPSI):** To enforce the Union Security Clause upon the union's recommendation, subject to due process requirements.
*   **Union (FPSILU):** To act fairly and with sufficient evidence when recommending termination of members.

**Liabilities & Award:**

*   The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the validity of the dismissal *cause* based on the Union Security Clause but found a *procedural due process* violation.
*   Respondents (FPSI and/or Amparo Policarpio) were ordered to pay each petitioner P30,000.00 in nominal damages for violating their statutory right to due process (lack of proper notices and hearing).
*   The award of separation pay and attorney's fees by the Labor Arbiter was not upheld on appeal.
*   Withheld salary of Inguillo was ordered to be paid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Due Process:** The core issue is whether the employer adequately fulfilled procedural due process requirements (two notices and a hearing). The Court found the employer's actions (relying on the Union's "Petisyon") insufficient.
*   **Arbitrariness:** The Court cautioned against untrammeled enforcement of Union Security Clauses, which could lead to arbitrary dismissals.
*   **Ambiguity in Union Clause:** The language of the Union Security Clause needs careful interpretation to avoid overbroad application.
*   **"Petisyon" as Notice:** The document called "Petisyon" was found to be a recommendation, but a proper notice of termination.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code Articles 282, 283, 284, 285:** Pertaining to grounds for termination of employment.
*   **Agabon vs. NLRC:** Affirms that a valid cause for dismissal exists, the absence of statutory due process entitles the employee to nominal damages.
*   **King of Kings Transport v. Mamac:** Outlines the requirements for procedural due process in termination cases (two-notice rule).
*   **Del Monte Philippines v. Saldivar:** Confirms the CBA is law between the parties.
*   **Caltex Refinery Employees Association (CREA) v. Brillantes:** Discussed effectiveness of union security clause in CBA.
*   **Alabang Country Club, Inc. v. NLRC:** Outlines requirements for enforcing a Union Security Clause.

**Concise Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision that the petitioners' dismissal was *valid in cause* due to violation of the Union Security Clause (joining a rival union), but found a *procedural due process violation* (insufficient notices and hearing). The employer was ordered to pay nominal damages for the procedural lapses. The key legal issues revolve around the adequacy of the notice and hearing provided to the employees before termination.
