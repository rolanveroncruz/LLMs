## Legal Document Summary: *Telmo v. Bustamante*

**Case:** *Guillermo M. Telmo v. Luciano M. Bustamante*, G.R. No. 182567, July 13, 2009 (610 Phil. 222).

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, questioning the Ombudsman's decision finding Municipal Engineer Telmo administratively liable.

**Facts:**

*   Bustamante owns Lot 952-A. Telmo (Municipal Engineer) and his brother own adjacent lots.
*   Construction of the Noveleta-Naic-Tagaytay Road allegedly encroached on Bustamante's property.
*   Bustamante attempted to enclose his remaining property with concrete posts.
*   Telmo, claiming Bustamante's property now belonged to the government due to the road and its easement, removed the posts. He allegedly stated he would not issue building permits for any construction on the land.
*   Bustamante filed criminal and administrative charges against Telmo and Brgy. Chairman Consumo for violation of Article 312 of the Revised Penal Code, Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft Act), and Section 4 of RA 6713 (Code of Conduct for Public Officials).

**Ombudsman Decision:** Found Telmo and Consumo administratively liable under RA 6713. Elizalde Telmo was dismissed.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Telmo's Argument:** Justified his actions under the National Building Code (PD 1096), Revised Philippine Highway Act (PD 17) implemented by D.O. 52, and the Civil Code provisions on nuisance (Art. 694, 699). He claimed the concrete posts obstructed a public highway and were a nuisance per se. He stated he was acting within his authority as Municipal Engineer/Building Official.
*   **Bustamante's Claim:** Alleged Telmo abused his position and unjustly deprived him of the use of his property. Initially sought criminal and administrative penalties. However, he later filed an affidavit of desistance stating the issues were misunderstandings that had been settled.
* **Court's Decision:** The Supreme Court disagreed with the argument that there was a nuisance per se. It MODIFIED the Ombudsman's ruling, finding Telmo administratively guilty of **DISCOURTESY IN THE COURSE OF OFFICIAL DUTIES**. A simple reprimand was implemented.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 312** Occupation of real property or usurpation of real rights in property.
*   **Republic Act No. 3019, Section 3(e)** (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act): Corrupt practices of public officers.
*   **Republic Act No. 6713, Section 4** (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees): Norms of conduct.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1096** (National Building Code), Sections 214-215: Dangerous buildings and structures.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 17, Section 23** (Revised Philippine Highway Act).
*   **Civil Code, Articles 694 and 699:** Nuisance and abatement.
*   **DPWH Department Order No. 52, Series of 2003:** Removal of Obstructions on National Roads.
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Regarding the offense of discourtesy.

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   **Telmo:** Although the fine was overturned, he was found guilty of a lesser offense (Discourtesy) and received a reprimand. The case highlights the risk of overstepping authority even when acting with perceived good intentions.
*   **Local Government:** The case underscores the importance of proper procedures for eminent domain and road construction projects, including proper compensation and communication with affected property owners.
*   **Bustamante:** The court acknowledged the lack of clarity regarding whether the taking of his property was for the road itself or an easement. He would need to pursue a separate claim against the national government for just compensation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Extent of Taking:** The exact area taken for the road versus the right-of-way easement was not definitively established, leading to the dispute over ownership and the right to enclose the property.
*   **Application of Nuisance Per Se:** The Court rejected Telmo's argument that the concrete posts constituted a nuisance per se, indicating a strict interpretation of this concept in relation to public obstruction.

**Summary:** This case primarily concerns the administrative liability of a municipal engineer who summarily removed alleged obstructions on what he believed to be government-owned property. While the engineer claimed to be performing his duty, the court found him guilty of discourtesy due to his failure to follow proper procedures. The case also implicitly touches on the need for clear and fair processes in eminent domain proceedings.
