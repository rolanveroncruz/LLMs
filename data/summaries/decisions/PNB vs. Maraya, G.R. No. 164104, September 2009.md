## Legal Document Summary: PNB vs. Maraya

**Case:** G.R. No. 164104, September 11, 2009 (615 Phil. 462)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Philippine National Bank (PNB)
*   **Respondents:** Gregorio B. Maraya, Jr. and Wenefrida Maraya (Spouses Maraya)
*   **Additional Party:** Jesus and Diosdada Cerro (Spouses Cerro, Subsequent Buyers from PNB)

**Subject Matter:** Annulment of Extrajudicial Foreclosure Sale and Quieting of Title

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgage:** Spouses Maraya secured a loan from PNB in 1977 and mortgaged their property (TCT No. T-381) as security.
*   **Default:** Spouses Maraya defaulted on their loan obligations.
*   **Extrajudicial Foreclosure:** PNB initiated extrajudicial foreclosure under Act No. 3135.  Key issue is the lack of proper publication of the Notice of Sale.
*   **Publication Requirement (Section 3, Act No. 3135):** Notice of sale must be posted for at least 20 days in three public places AND, if the property value exceeds P400, published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation.
*   **Certificate of Sale:** PNB emerged as the highest bidder and was issued a Sheriff's Certificate of Sale on November 27, 1990.
*   **Sale to Spouses Cerro:** PNB subsequently sold the property to Spouses Cerro after the redemption period expired and after a public bidding on May 11, 1993. A Deed of Absolute Sale was executed on July 15, 1993.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **PNB's Liability:** The courts found PNB liable for conducting an invalid extrajudicial foreclosure due to non-compliance with the publication requirement of Act No. 3135. This could result in financial losses due to potential claims for damages, restitution of property to Spouses Maraya, and/or being responsible for refunding Spouses Cerro the purchase price.
*   **Spouses Cerro's Risk:** Spouses Cerro are at risk of losing their investment as the Deed of Absolute Sale was declared void, and they acquired no valid title. They may have a claim against PNB for breach of contract and potentially for damages.
*   **Spouses Maraya's Rights:** Spouses Maraya have a right to have the foreclosure declared void and their title restored. They may also have a claim for damages resulting from the unlawful foreclosure.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135, Section 3:** The core statutory provision regarding extrajudicial foreclosure and publication requirements.  Failure to strictly comply invalidates the sale.
*   **Tambunting v. Court of Appeals (167 SCRA 16):**  Stresses strict compliance with publication requirements and the invalidation of sales for even slight deviations.
*   **Campomanes v. Bartolome (38 Phil. 808):** Reinforces the importance of proper notice in foreclosure proceedings.
*   **Ouano v. Court of Appeals (446 Phil. 690):**  Emphasizes that publication is a jurisdictional requirement and cannot be waived, as it would convert a public auction into a private sale.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **PNB's Argument of Knowledge:** PNB argued that the Spouses Maraya's knowledge of the foreclosure proceedings should excuse the lack of publication. This argument was rejected by the courts, highlighting the mandatory nature of the publication requirement.  This implies the inadmissibility of "actual notice" to circumvent explicit statutory provisions.
*   **Impact of Assessed Value:** The assessed value of the lot (P1,800) and building (P4,500) at the time of the sale was above the P400 threshold in Act No. 3135, triggering the publication requirement.

**Overall:** The case emphasizes the strict interpretation and mandatory application of Act No. 3135's publication requirements in extrajudicial foreclosure. PNB's failure to comply with these requirements rendered the foreclosure sale void, impacting the rights of all parties involved. This ruling underscores the importance of meticulously adhering to statutory procedures in foreclosure proceedings to ensure fairness and protect property rights. The decision also rejects the argument that knowledge of the proceedings can substitute for proper publication.
