## Legal Document Summary: *De Zuzuarregui, Jr. v. Soguilon*, Adm. Case No. 4495

**Type of Document:** Supreme Court Resolution in an administrative case for disbarment.

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Antonio de Zuzuarregui, Jr.
*   **Respondent:** Atty. Apolonia A.C. Soguilon

**Issue:** Whether Atty. Soguilon should be disciplined for misconduct, concealment of truth, and misleading the court in relation to a petition for reconstitution of title (LRC No. Q-7195 (95)) where she served as counsel.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Allegation 1: Misleading the Court Regarding Document Notations:** Complainant alleges Atty. Soguilon failed to highlight notations on Exhibits "F" and "G" (technical description and sketch plan) indicating potential inaccuracies and limitations of the documents, thereby misleading the court.
*   **Allegation 2: Non-Compliance with RA No. 26:** Complainant contends that Atty. Soguilon failed to comply with Section 12 in relation to Section 3(f) of RA No. 26 by not properly identifying and notifying all interested parties (occupants, adjoining owners).
*   **Allegation 3: Fraudulent Claim of LRA Compliance:** Complainant asserts that Atty. Soguilon falsely represented compliance with Land Registration Authority (LRA) requirements.
*   **Complainant's Evidence:** Decisions in C.A. G.R. SP No. 40897 and C.A. G.R. CV No. 59363, which affirmed the setting aside of the reconstitution.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Denied all allegations. Argued she submitted documents unaltered, relied on client's information, and submitted required documents to LRA.

**Findings:**

*   The Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) investigated and recommended dismissal. The Supreme Court agreed with the IBP's findings.
*   No evidence of malice or intent to mislead the court regarding document notations. The notations were visible, and the Court evaluated the documents.
*   Reliance on Client Information: Atty. Soguilon relied on her client's representations regarding interested parties, which was deemed reasonable.
*   No conclusive proof of fraudulent claim regarding LRA compliance.
*   Reversible Error but not Malice: The Court found no reason to disturb the findings of the IBP. Any prejudice to the Complainant was cured, as the order of reconstitution was subsequently set aside.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA No. 26:** Republic Act No. 26 (An Act Providing a Special Procedure for the Reconstitution of Torrens Certificates of Title Lost or Destroyed) – Specifically, Section 12 in relation to Section 3(f) regarding notice to interested parties.
*   **Cruz v. Centron:** Cites the quantum of proof required in disbarment cases (preponderant evidence).
*   **Mendoza v. Mercado:** Reinforces that lawyers are not expected to know all the law and are not liable for honest mistakes.
*   **Section 27, Rule 138 of the Revised Rules of Court:**  Enumerates the grounds of disbarment but is not exclusive.
*   **C.A. G.R. SP No. 40897 & C.A. G.R. CV No. 59363:** CA cases cited by the Complainant.

**Decision:**

*   Complaint dismissed. Atty. Soguilon is not sanctioned.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Client:** The case highlights the risk of relying solely on client information without independent verification, particularly in reconstitution cases where proper notice is crucial. While the attorney was excused here, a more diligent investigation of potential interested parties might have prevented the initial errors.
*   **Duty to the Court:** The case dances around the duty of an attorney to be completely forthright with the court. While unintentional omissions may be excusable, the line between an honest mistake and a deliberate attempt to conceal can be thin and fact-dependent.
*   **Reversible Error vs. Misconduct:**  The determination that errors were "reversible" and not indicative of misconduct provides limited comfort.  If the errors had not been later rectified, the outcome might have been different. This highlights the importance of thorough due diligence regardless of reliance on client representations.
*    **Ambiguity in the Application of RA 26:** While the IBP found no deliberate omissions, questions remain about the diligence of the respondent in ascertaining the true ownership status of the land and identifying all interested parties.

**Conclusion:**

The case serves as a reminder of the duties and responsibilities of lawyers in handling reconstitution cases, particularly regarding due diligence and providing accurate information to the court. While honest mistakes are excusable, the failure to adequately investigate and verify information can expose lawyers to potential disciplinary action and, at the very least, could result in an unnecessary appeal and delay for their client. The attorney’s reliance on her client’s information was allowed in this instance, however, it may not be sufficient to avoid professional liability in other circumstances.
