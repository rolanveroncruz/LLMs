## Legal Document Summary: *Quiamco v. Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc.* (G.R. No. 170852, September 12, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a CA decision affirming an RTC decision holding petitioners liable for sum of money and damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Suretyship Agreement:** Petitioners (Quiamco spouses) entered into a suretyship agreement with Respondent (Capital Insurance) for a supersedeas bond to appeal a labor case decision against them to the NLRC.
*   **Indemnity Agreement:** Petitioners executed an indemnity agreement to reimburse Respondent for all losses and expenses incurred as surety.  This agreement includes a 20% attorney's fees clause (minimum P2,000).
*   **Undated Check:** Petitioners provided an undated check to Respondent as security, later dishonored due to account closure.
*   **Dismissal of Appeal:** The NLRC dismissed petitioners' appeal due to late posting of the bond (more than 10 days from receipt of the decision).
*   **Payment by Surety:** Respondent paid the NLRC on the bond following a writ of execution.
*   **Incontestability Clause:** Indemnity agreement contains clause making payment by the surety final and not contested by the debtors.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners' Obligation:** To reimburse Respondent for the amount paid on the bond, plus interest, and expenses, based on the suretyship and indemnity agreements.
*   **Respondent's Obligation:**  As surety, to pay the judgment amount in the labor case when execution was ordered due to the dismissal of the appeal.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Perfection of Contract:** Petitioners argued the surety agreement wasn't perfected because the bond failed to stay the execution of the labor case judgment.  The Court held that the perfection wasn't dependent on the successful appeal and was perfected upon meeting of the minds and fulfilling requirements by the petitioners.
*   **"Whereas" Clause:** Petitioners based their argument of imperfect contract off of the bond’s “whereas” clauses, but the Court held this to be simply a statement of purpose and not a suspensive condition, which would require clear and unambiguous language.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The CA deleted the award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses by the RTC for lack of basis. However, the indemnity agreement contains a 20% attorney's fees clause, so this could be argued on remand.
*   **Closed Bank Account:** The dishonored check, while not determinative of the suretyship's validity, strengthens Respondent's argument for the Petitioners' lack of good faith.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The decision mentions conflicting dates for when petitioners received the decision in the labor case; The CA deleted the award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses for lack of basis, which is in direct opposition of the Indemnity Agreement stipulating 20% legal fees.

**Conclusion:**

The Court denied the petition, holding that the suretyship agreement was perfected and the Petitioners are liable to reimburse the Respondent. The key factor was the Court's interpretation that the 'whereas' clause was merely a statement of purpose, not a suspensive condition requiring successful appeal for the contract's validity. The indemnity agreement further solidified the Petitioners' obligation to reimburse the surety.
