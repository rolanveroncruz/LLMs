## Legal Document Summary: *Ricky Anyayahan v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 229787 (June 20, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC conviction for Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 ("Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002").

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   Accused Anyayahan was charged with both Illegal Sale (Section 5) and Illegal Possession (Section 11) of *shabu* (Methamphetamine Hydrochloride) based on a buy-bust operation.
*   RTC acquitted Anyayahan of Illegal Sale due to failure to prove consideration (SPO1 Monte unclear on money transfer) but convicted him of Illegal Possession for both sachets of shabu (one allegedly sold, one recovered from pocket).
*   CA affirmed the RTC's conviction for Illegal Possession, finding all elements present and integrity of evidence preserved.

**Issue:**

*   Whether the CA correctly upheld Anyayahan's conviction for Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under Section 11, Article II of RA 9165.

**Court's Ruling (Reversed Conviction):**

*   **Meritorious Appeal:** The Court **reversed** the CA and acquitted Anyayahan.
*   **Chain of Custody Breach:** The Court found the police officers unjustifiably deviated from Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, particularly in conducting the inventory and photography.
    *   Absence of a DOJ representative during the physical inventory and photography.
    *   Witnesses (barangay official and media representative) were not present during the *immediate* inventory and photography.
    *   Police waited an hour for the barangay officials, which goes against the law.
*   **No Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for the non-compliance with the mandatory procedures outlined in Section 21, RA 9165. The Court stressed the importance of earnest efforts to comply with the mandated procedure.
*   **Integrity and Evidentiary Value Compromised:** Due to the unjustified breaches, the integrity and evidentiary value of the *corpus delicti* were compromised.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Law Enforcement Obligations:** Strict adherence to Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 regarding chain of custody procedures in handling seized drugs.  Prosecution bears the burden to prove compliance with these procedures.
*   **Prosecutorial Duty:** Prosecutors must prove compliance with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 and justify any perceived deviations from the said procedure.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Evidence Suppression:** Failure to comply with chain of custody requirements under Section 21 of RA 9165 can lead to evidence suppression and acquittal of the accused.
*   **Wrongful Conviction:** Non-compliance with procedural safeguards increases the risk of wrongful conviction.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sections 5 & 11:** Defines and penalizes Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, respectively.
*   **RA 10640:** Amends Section 21 of RA 9165 (particularly concerning requirements for inventory and photography).
*   **Section 21, Article II, IRR of RA 9165:** Details the procedure for handling seized drugs to preserve integrity and evidentiary value.
*   ***People v. Mendoza,*** 736 Phil. 749 (2014): Stresses the importance of having media/DOJ representative during seizure and marking.
*   ***People v. Almorfe,*** 631 Phil. 51 (2010): Highlights that justification for non-compliance must be presented.
*   ***People v. De Guzman,*** 630 Phil. 637 (2010): States justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses (Based on Case Facts):**

*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance with Section 21:** The standard for what constitutes "justifiable grounds" is interpreted strictly, requiring proactive justification from the prosecution, not merely assumed or presumed reasons. The lack of a DOJ representative and failure to immediately conduct inventory in the presence of all required parties was deemed to be a compliance issue.
