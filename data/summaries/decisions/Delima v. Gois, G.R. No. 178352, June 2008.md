**Summary of *Delima v. Gois*, G.R. No. 178352, June 17, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the CA decision that reversed the NLRC's resolutions and ordered the return of a cash bond.

**Facts:** Virgilio Delima (Petitioner) won an illegal dismissal case against Golden Union Aquamarine Corporation ("Golden") and Susan Gois (Respondent) before the Labor Arbiter. Golden failed to appeal. Gois, claiming ownership of an attached vehicle (used by Golden), filed a Third Party Claim, which was initially denied. She substituted the vehicle with a cash bond of P115,561.05. The NLRC dismissed Gois's appeal of the denial of her Third Party Claim. Gois then filed a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals.

**Court of Appeals Decision:** The CA granted Gois's petition, annulling the NLRC resolutions and ordering Delima to return the cash bond. The CA reasoned that the Labor Arbiter's decision only directed Golden to pay Delima, not Gois personally, and that Gois's separate corporate personality as a stockholder protected her assets.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Limited Liability of Corporate Officers:** The decision reinforces the principle of separate corporate personality. Corporate officers are generally not liable for corporate debts unless they acted with malice or bad faith, or deliberately sought to evade the corporation's financial obligations (citing *Reahs Corporation*). There was no showing of malice or bad faith in the termination of Delima's employment.

*   **Third-Party Claim:** This centers on whether Gois's vehicle could be attached to satisfy Golden's debt. The CA ruled that the vehicle belonged to Gois and couldn't be seized to satisfy Golden's debt, as Golden has a separate and distinct personality of its own.

*   **Timeliness of Petition for Certiorari:** Crucially, the SC affirms the CA's conclusion that Gois's Petition for Certiorari was timely filed within the 60-day period under Rule 65, following *St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC*. This rendered the NLRC's Entry of Judgment premature.

*   **Reimbursement:** The SC modifies the CA's decision by ordering Golden to reimburse Gois the P115,561.05 cash bond. This is based on preventing unjust enrichment, as Golden benefited from Gois's payment.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 65 of the Rules of Court (Certiorari)
*   Section 4, Rule 65, Rules of Court (Period for filing certiorari)
*   Section 4, Rule III, New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC (Computation of Appeal Period)

**Case Law:**

*   *Reahs Corporation vs. NLRC* (doctrine of separate personality; establishing solidary liability)
*   *Malonso v. Principe* (separate juridical personality of a corporation)
*   *St. Martin Funeral Home v. National Labor Relations Commission* (Rule 65 certiorari as mode of appeal from NLRC)
*   *Juco v. Heirs of Tomas Siy Chung Fu* (Finality of Decisions)
*   *David v. Cordova* (Period for Certiorari)
*   *Ginete v. Sunrise Manning Agency* (Period for Certiorari)

**Liabilities:**

*   **Golden:** Ultimately liable for the judgment debt to Delima *and* obligated to reimburse Gois for the cash bond she posted.
*   **Gois:**  Not personally liable for Golden's debt.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Specific Finding of Bad Faith:** The absence of a specific finding of malice or bad faith in the dismissal is key to shielding Gois from personal liability.  If facts existed supporting such a finding (e.g., evidence Gois actively participated in the dismissal with the intent to harm Delima), the outcome could have differed.
*   **Ownership Proof:** The CA heavily relied on Gois's established ownership of the vehicle. Should this ownership be challenged as a sham or attempt to shield corporate assets, a different result could occur, although this specific issue was already decided by NLRC in favor of the petitioner.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision to protect Gois's personal assets from the corporation's liabilities, but modified the ruling to prevent unjust enrichment, shifting the financial burden back to the corporation. The key takeaway is the strict adherence to the principle of separate corporate personality and the requirement of proving bad faith to pierce the corporate veil, and the timely filling of petition for certiorari.
