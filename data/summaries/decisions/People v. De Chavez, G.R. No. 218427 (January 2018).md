    *   Crim. Case No. 13941-06-C: Qualified Rape (carnal knowledge due to father-daughter relationship with force, threat, and intimidation). (Art. 266-A, RPC as qualified by relationship)
    *   Crim. Case No. 13942-06-C: Qualified Rape (carnal knowledge due to father-daughter relationship with force, threat, and intimidation). (Art. 266-A, RPC as qualified by relationship)
    *   Crim. Case No. 13943-06-C: Sexual assault (finger insertion into genitalia). (Art. 266-A, RPC)
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt on all counts. Imposed penalties of imprisonment and monetary damages.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision but increased exemplary damages.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the CA Decision with Modifications in Monetary Awards and Penalties for Rape by Sexual Assault. (See Below)

**Obligations & Penalties:**

*   **Criminal Case Nos. 13941-06-C and 13942-06-C (Qualified Rape):**
    *   Reclusion Perpetua (imposed due to the prohibition of the death penalty, and the established qualifying circumstance of the father-daughter relationship).
    *   Civil Indemnity: ₱100,000.00 for each count.
    *   Moral Damages: ₱100,000.00 for each count.
    *   Exemplary Damages: ₱100,000.00 for each count.
*   **Criminal Case Nos. 13940-06-C and 13943-06-C (Rape by Sexual Assault):**
    *   8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* (minimum) to 17 years and 4 months of *reclusion temporal* (maximum).
    *   Civil Indemnity: ₱30,000.00 for each count.
    *   Moral Damages: ₱30,000.00 for each count.
    *   Exemplary Damages: ₱30,000.00 for each count.
*   **Interest:** All damages awarded accrue interest at 6% per annum from the finality of the judgment until fully paid.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal Liability: Guilt for rape by sexual assault and qualified rape.
*   Financial Liability: Payment of civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages as detailed above, plus interest.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Appellant challenged the consistency and credibility of the prosecution witnesses, alleging coaching. The Court dismissed this, citing the trial court's superior position to assess witness demeanor and the victim's traumatic experience affecting recall (citing *People v. Sonido*).
*   **Factual Findings:** The Supreme Court emphasized that factual findings of the trial court, when affirmed by the CA, are generally binding and conclusive.
*   **Lack of Seminal Fluid:** The medico-legal report indicated "NON-REACTIVE to Seminal Stain Reagent." However, the Court relied more on testimony of the witness and the medical finding of deep healed lacerations, which they deemed to be physical evidence of abuse of sexual contact, referencing jurisprudence that physical lacerations are the best evidence of forcible defloration (*People v. Saludo*).
*   **Penalty Discrepancies:** The Supreme Court modified the penalties for rape by sexual assault, clarifying the proper range of *prision mayor* to *reclusion temporal*.
*   **Monetary Awards:** The Supreme Court standardized the monetary awards to align with prevailing jurisprudence (citing *People v. Jugueta*).

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC), Art. 266-A (Rape) and amendments thereto.
*   Republic Act No. 7610, RA 9262
