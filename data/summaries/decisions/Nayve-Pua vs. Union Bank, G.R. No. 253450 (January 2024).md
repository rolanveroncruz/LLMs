## Legal Document Summary: Nayve-Pua v. Union Bank of the Philippines

**Case:** G.R. No. 253450, January 22, 2024

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Lani Nayve-Pua (Lani)
*   **Respondent:** Union Bank of the Philippines (Union Bank)

**Subject Matter:** Annulment of Real Estate Mortgage (REM), Foreclosure, and Certificate of Sale

**Key Issue:** Whether the mortgage and subsequent foreclosure of the property in favor of Union Bank is valid, specifically if Lani's consent to the mortgage was necessary. This hinges on the property regime and ownership.

**Background:**

*   Lani and Stephen Pua (Stephen) cohabited before marriage in 1983. During cohabitation, in 1978, Stephen purchased a property registered solely under his name as "single."
*   Spouses Cromwell and Catherine Uy (Spouses Uy), relatives of Stephen, mortgaged the property to Union Bank using a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) allegedly signed by Lani and Stephen.
*   Spouses Uy defaulted on their loan, and Union Bank foreclosed the mortgage. Lani claims forgery of her signature on the SPA and lack of consent, arguing the property is conjugal.
*   Lani filed a complaint for Annulment of REM, Foreclosure, and Certificate of Sale against Union Bank of the Philippines.

**RTC Ruling:** Dismissed the complaint, upholding the validity of the REM, finding Lani failed to prove co-ownership. Property was acquired pre-marriage and titled solely to Stephen.

**CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision, finding the property was acquired before the marriage and that Article 147 of the Family Code is a prima facie presumption that does not prevail over a valid title under the Torrens system. Lani failed to prove contributions to the property's acquisition and that she and Stephen lived exclusively as husband and wife.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** Denied the Petition. Affirmed CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

1.  **Property Regime:** The Court determined that since the marriage occurred in 1983, the property relations are governed by the *Civil Code's* conjugal partnership of gains (Art. 119, Civil Code), and is supplementarily applied by Family Code (Art. 109, Family Code). The property was acquired *before* the marriage. Properties acquired before the marriage are considered paraphernal or exclusive property of the acquiring spouse (Art. 148, Civil Code & Art 109 Family Code).
2.  **Presumption of Conjugality (Art. 160, Civil Code & Art. 116, Family Code):** This presumption *does not* apply because the property was acquired *before* the marriage. The burden of proof is on Lani to prove the property is conjugal. Court found that since the residential building was already existing and included in his acquisition, its character as Stephen's separate property remains unchanged; the conversion principle under Article 158 of the Civil Code will not apply.
3.  **Article 147, Family Code:** Lani invoked Article 147, which governs property relations in cases of cohabitation without marriage, and claims co-ownership.
    *   The Court noted that the presumption of co-ownership under Article 147 is *prima facie only* and can be rebutted (Valdes v. RTC).
    *   The CA observed that the title to the property is under Stephen's name alone, and the Conditional Contract of Sale and Deed of Absolute Sale are executed by Enrico Aberion (seller) and "STEPHEN PUA, of legal age, single, resident of Cauayan, Isabela."
    *   Lani failed to prove contributions to the acquisition.
4.  **Family Home:** Lani argued the property was the family home and required her consent for the mortgage.
    *   The Court determined that Lani failed to sufficiently prove that the property was used as their family home at the time it was mortgaged. Although birth certificates of children showed addresses at the property (1978-1982), no evidence was submitted to prove residence at the property at the time of the mortgage in 1998.
    *   Even if it *was* a family home, the Court cited Articles 232 and 235 of the Civil Code and Articles 155, 158 and 160 of the Family Code and noted that the family home may still be mortgaged and foreclosed.
5.  **Due Diligence of Union Bank:** Lani claimed Union Bank failed to exercise due diligence.
    *   The Court found Union Bank appraised the property prior to approving the loan and mortgage agreement with Spouses Uy.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Lani failed to prove co-ownership or conjugal nature of the property. Therefore, no basis to annul the mortgage.
*   Stephen, as the registered owner, had the right to mortgage the property without Lani's consent.
*   Union Bank acted with due diligence in appraising the property and did not need to verify Lani's signature on the SPA since Stephen was the sole owner.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Forgery Claim:** Lani's claim of forgery on the SPA was not explicitly addressed as it was deemed irrelevant due to Stephen's sole ownership. The court did not conduct handwriting expert analysis.
*   **Family Home Argument:** The failure to conclusively establish the property as the family home was critical to Lani's case. If stronger evidence of residency at the time of the mortgage had been presented, it may have impacted the court's decision.
*   **Interpretation of Art. 147:** The application of Article 147 Family Code, and whether the contributions of a spouse taking care of the family and home can be considered as contribution.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code: Art. 119, Art. 143, Art. 148, Art. 158, Art. 160, Art. 223, Art. 227, Art. 228, Art. 232, Art. 235
*   Family Code: Art. 109, Art. 116, Art. 124, Art. 147, Art. 153, Art. 155, Art. 158, Art. 160, Art. 256

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the validity of the mortgage and foreclosure based on the finding that the property was Stephen's exclusive property acquired before the marriage. Lani's consent to the mortgage was therefore not required. Lani failed to provide sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of Stephen's exclusive ownership or to establish the property as the family home.
