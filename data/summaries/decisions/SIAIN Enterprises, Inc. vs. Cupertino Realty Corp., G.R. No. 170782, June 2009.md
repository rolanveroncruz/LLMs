## Legal Document Summary - *Siain Enterprises, Inc. vs. Cupertino Realty Corp.*

**Case Citation:** 608 Phil. 236, G.R. No. 170782, June 22, 2009

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's dismissal of Siain's complaint regarding extrajudicial foreclosure of a real estate mortgage.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Promissory Note (April 10, 1995):** Siain obtained a P37,000,000 loan from Cupertino. Cupertino was authorized to escrow the funds to pay off Siain's DBP loan.
*   **Real Estate Mortgage (April 10, 1995):** Secures the P37,000,000 loan.
*   **Amendment to Promissory Note (April 12, 1995):** Stipulates a 17% per annum interest rate on the P37,000,000 loan.
*   **Promissory Note (August 16, 1995):**  Siain (and Cua Le Leng as co-maker) promised to pay Cupertino P160,000,000 with 30% compounding interest per annum.  Includes stipulations for accelerated payment upon default (including bankruptcy, insolvency, levy, garnishment, attachment, conviction), a 3% per month penalty on the total amount due, attorney's fees of 20% of the total amount due, and a waiver of rights under Rule 39, Section 12 of the Rules of Court regarding execution of judgments. Contains express consent to extensions, renewals, and partial payments without novation of the agreement and also contain an authorization for CUpertino to dispose of Le Leng's pledged shares of stock for loan satisfaction. The promissory note also states jurisdiction for legal action will be in either the Courts of the City of Manila or the place of execution of the note at Cupertino's option.
*   **Amendment to Real Estate Mortgage (August 16, 1995):** Increases the total loan secured by the real estate mortgage from P37,000,000 to P197,000,000, reflecting a supposed P160,000,000 loan increase.

**Liabilities:**

*   Siain Enterprises, Inc.: Obligation to repay the P37,000,000 and P160,000,000 loans (totaling P197,000,000), plus interest, penalties, and attorney's fees as stipulated in the promissory notes.
*   Cua Le Leng: Personally liable as co-maker on the P160,000,000 promissory note.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Disputed Consideration:** Siain argues it never received the P160,000,000 loan increase, making the amended real estate mortgage invalid for lack of consideration. This is the central dispute.
*   **High Interest Rates & Penalties:** The 30% compounding annual interest rate and 3% per month penalty on default are potentially usurious and could be challenged under the Usury Law.
*   **Waiver of Rights (Rule 39, Section 12):** Waiver of rights under Rule 39, Section 12 of the Rules of Court (redemption rights) in case of judicial execution could be subject to scrutiny for voluntariness and fairness.
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** Cupertino's argument, accepted by the lower courts, that Siain's affiliates received the funds and therefore Siain is liable raises potential issues of alter ego liability and fairness.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 9 (Parol Evidence Rule):** Generally prohibits extrinsic evidence to vary the terms of a written contract. The courts below did not apply the parol evidence rule in this case.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 131, Section 3 (Disputable Presumptions):**  The promissory notes raise a presumption of sufficient consideration.
*   **Negotiable Instruments Law, Section 24 (Presumption of Consideration):**  Every negotiable instrument is deemed to have been issued for valuable consideration.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1198:** Reference regarding circumstances leading to the possibility of accelerated payment; Article unclear without supporting documentation.
*   **Corporation Code, Section 2:** States that a corporation has a separate legal entity.
*   **Civil Code, Article 44:** States that a corporation has a separate legal entity.
*   **Case Law on Piercing the Corporate Veil:** Numerous cases address the circumstances under which a corporation's separate legal personality can be disregarded.
*   **Usury Law:** Potentially applicable to the high interest rates and penalties.

**Ambiguities & Contentious Points:**

*   The discrepancy between the loan documents (indicating indebtedness) and Siain's claim of non-receipt of the P160,000,000.00 loan.
*   The application of the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, particularly whether sufficient justification exists to disregard the separate legal personalities of Siain and its affiliates.
*   The validity and enforceability of the waiver of redemption rights.

**Conclusion:**

This case hinges on the issue of consideration for the amended real estate mortgage.  Siain's success depends on rebutting the presumptions of consideration arising from the loan documents and establishing that it never received the P160,000,000. The high interest rates, penalties, and the waiver of redemption rights present potential avenues for challenging the enforceability of the loan agreement.  The application of the piercing the corporate veil doctrine needs careful scrutiny to ensure fairness and prevent injustice.
