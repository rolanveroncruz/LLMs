## Legal Document Summary: *Nicolas v. Romulo*, G.R. No. 175888, February 11, 2009

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions challenging the constitutionality and implementation of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) between the Philippines and the United States, specifically regarding the custody of L/CPL Daniel Smith, convicted of rape.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article XVIII, Section 25 of the Philippine Constitution:** Foreign military bases, troops, or facilities shall not be allowed in the Philippines except under a treaty duly concurred in by the Senate and recognized as a treaty by the other contracting State.
*   **Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA):**
    *   **Article V, Section 6:** Grants custody of US personnel accused of crimes in the Philippines to US military authorities from the commission of the offense until the completion of judicial proceedings, with the obligation to make personnel available for Philippine proceedings. Includes a one-year time limit for completing proceedings, excluding appeals and delays caused by US authorities.
    *   **Article V, Section 10:** Confinement or detention by Philippine authorities of US personnel shall be carried out in facilities agreed on by appropriate Philippine and United States authorities. United States personnel serving sentences in the Philippines shall have the right to visits and material assistance.
*   **Romulo-Kenney Agreements (December 19 & 22, 2006):** Agreements transferring L/CPL Smith to US military custody at the US Embassy for detention.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Philippines:** Liable for violating Article V, Section 10 of the VFA if detention facilities are not under Philippine authority. Risk of international censure if the Philippines fails to comply with its treaty obligations, although the US ability to enforce the treaty is complicated by *Medellin v. Texas* (see below).
*   **United States:** If the VFA is deemed not to be self-executing under US law, the US may be unable to fully comply with the VFA's provisions, potentially creating international friction.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Bayan v. Zamora (342 SCRA 449):** Previous Supreme Court case upholding the constitutionality of the VFA. The present case seeks to overturn this precedent.
*   **RP-US Mutual Defense Treaty (1951):** The VFA is argued to be an implementing agreement of the RP-US Mutual Defense Treaty, which *was* ratified by both the Philippine and US Senates.
*   **Medellin v. Texas (552 US ___ No. 06-984, March 25, 2008):** U.S. Supreme Court ruling that treaties are not automatically part of US domestic law unless they are self-executing or Congress enacts implementing legislation.
*   **Case-Zablocki Act (1 U.S.C. 112b):** Requires the US Secretary of State to transmit the text of international agreements (other than treaties) to Congress.
*   **Weinberger v. Rossi (456 U.S. 25 (1982)):** Enforced provisions of an executive agreement granting preferential employment to Filipinos in US Bases.
*   **Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer [343 U.S. 579 (1952]:** a tripartite scheme was used as a framework for evaluating executive action.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Recognized as a treaty by the other contracting State" (Article XVIII, Section 25 of the Philippine Constitution):** The interpretation of this clause is central. Does it require ratification by the US Senate, or is mere acknowledgement sufficient? The dissenting opinions argue *Medellin v. Texas* raises the bar, requiring the VFA to be self-executing under US law.
*   **Article V, Section 10 (Detention Facilities):** While explicitly stating "detention...by Philippine authorities", the requirement for "facilities agreed on by appropriate Philippines and United States authorities" creates ambiguity regarding the extent of Philippine control and the possibility of undue US influence.
*   **VFA applicability in the light of *Medellin v. Texas*:** the US Supreme Court ruling in *Medellin v. Texas* raised the issue of the VFA being potentially unenforceable in the U.S. because it is not self-executing.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court PARTLY GRANTED the petitions, UPHOLDING the constitutionality of the VFA, but DECLARING the Romulo-Kenney Agreements NOT in accordance with the VFA. The Court ordered the Secretary of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with US representatives for an appropriate agreement on detention facilities under Philippine authorities, as mandated by Art. V, Sec. 10 of the VFA. The Court directed the Court of Appeals to resolve without delay the related matters pending therein.

**Potential Risks & Considerations:**

*   **Impact of *Medellin v. Texas*:** The dissenting opinions emphasize that the VFA may not be enforceable under US domestic law after *Medellin v. Texas*. This could create an unequal situation where the Philippines is bound by the VFA, but the US is not, effectively violating Article XVIII, Section 25 of the Philippine Constitution.
*   **Implementation of Art. V, Sec. 10:** Successfully negotiating detention facilities under Philippine authorities while respecting the VFA's provisions on material assistance and visits will be crucial. A failure to do so may result in further legal challenges.

**Note:** The summary focuses on legal precision and potential contentious areas to facilitate a lawyer's deeper analysis of the document and its implications.
