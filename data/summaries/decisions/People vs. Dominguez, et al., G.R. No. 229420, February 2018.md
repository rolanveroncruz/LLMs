**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Dominguez***

**Case:** G.R. No. 229420, February 19, 2018 (826 Phil. 368)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming the RTC's order to strike the testimony of a deceased state witness, Alfred Mendiola, from the record in a Carnapping with Homicide case (RA 6539, Sec. 14).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **RA 6539, Sec. 14:** Defines and penalizes carnapping, with escalating penalties based on violence/intimidation and homicide.  At stake is the penalty of *life imprisonment to death.*
*   **Rule 119, Sec. 17 (Rules of Court):**  Outlines requirements for discharging an accused to become a state witness. Evidence adduced in support of the discharge *automatically forms part of the trial.*
*   **Rule 119, Sec. 18 (Rules of Court):** Discharge of the accused operates as an acquittal *unless* the accused fails or refuses to testify against co-accused per sworn statement.
*   **Rule 115, Sec. 1(f) (Rules of Court):** Accused’s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses. Allows utilizing the testimony of a deceased witness if the adverse party had an opportunity to cross-examine.

**Issue:** Admissibility of deceased state witness's testimony given during discharge proceedings but before trial proper.

**Court's Ruling:**  Reversed the CA and RTC, reinstating the testimony. The court emphasized that Mendiola’s testimony, although given during the discharge proceedings, *automatically formed part* of the trial record per Rule 119, Sec. 17. Mendiola's extensive narration established qualifications for state witness eligibility.

**Key Arguments and Analysis:**

*   **Petitioner (People):** Right to confrontation is not absolute. Respondents waived the right to fully cross-examine by reserving it for trial, which never occurred due to Mendiola’s death.
*   **Respondent (Miranda):** Mendiola’s testimony was solely for discharge purposes and the full cross-examination at trial was not possible due to death, depriving them of due process and confrontation rights. Rolando Taiban and Joel Jacinto were not arrested when Mendiola testified during the discharge proceedings, thus there was a denial of the right to cross-examine the witness against them.
*   **Court:**
    *   **Waiver:** By reserving right to continue cross-examination for trial and not seeking continuance of discharge proceedings after death, the defense assumed the risk and waived objection to admissibility.
    *   **Opportunity to Cross-Examine:** Respondent's Counsels cross-examined at length for Mendiola’s testimony by the counsels of Miranda and the Dominguez brothers. The sole condition to utilize the testimony of a deceased witness is that the opposing party had the opportunity to cross-examine the same.
    *   **Completeness:** The Court argued the state witness testimony was sufficiently thorough that no further additional testimony was required to fulfill his obligation as a state witness.
    *   **Seneris Doctrine:**  Cited *People v. Seneris*, 99 SCRA 92 (1980), stating that the prosecution witness' testimony shall not be expunged from the records if the defense was able to conduct a rigorous and extensive cross-examination prior to the witness's demise.
    *   **Rule 115, Section 1:** The court argued that the accused's right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him was fulfilled since he was able to perform that right.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution:** Obligated to present competent evidence and secure the attendance of witnesses.  Failure to do so exposes the case to dismissal.
*   **Defense:**  Must diligently exercise right to cross-examine.  Strategic choices, like reserving cross-examination, carry inherent risks.
*   **State Witness (Had he lived):** Obligated to testify truthfully per sworn statement.  Failure to do so would void the acquittal benefit of being discharged and make testimony during discharge proceedings admissible against him.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Un-cross-examined testimony:** While *Seneris* supports admissibility, the degree to which respondents may challenge specific portions of the testimony as unreliable or incomplete because of the lack of full cross-examination remains an avenue for appeal.
*   **Untested Reliability:** The defense may still argue (though less persuasively now) that the testimony should be viewed with caution, given that it could not be fully tested through traditional trial procedures and can introduce potentially falsified or unreliable testimony.

**Next Steps:**

*   RTC will reinstate Mendiola's testimony.
*   RTC will rule on the admissibility of *documents* and other evidence authenticated by Mendiola during the discharge proceeding when formally offered.
*   Defense may appeal the ruling, arguing a violation of due process/confrontation rights or challenging specific aspects of the Mendiola testimony.

**Overall Assessment:**  The Supreme Court applied existing jurisprudence and rules of court to uphold the admissibility of the testimony. The legal basis for this is a strong but an appeal is still possible that would be based on the untested reliability of the state witness.
