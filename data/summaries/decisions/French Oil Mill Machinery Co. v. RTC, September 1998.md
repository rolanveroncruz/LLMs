## Legal Document Summary: *French Oil Mill Machinery Co., Inc. vs. RTC, Cebu City, Br. 11, and Ludo & Luym Oleochemical Co.* (G.R. No. 126477, September 11, 1998)

**Subject Matter:**  Jurisdiction over a foreign corporation (French Oil Mill Machinery Co., Inc. - "FOMMCO") due to alleged breach of contract.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Complaint:** Private respondent (Ludo & Luym Oleochemical Co.) filed a complaint against FOMMCO and its alleged agent, Trans-World Trading Company, for breach of contract and damages, asserting FOMMCO was doing business in the Philippines.
*   **Service of Summons:** Summons was served on Trans-World, which moved to dismiss, denying agency. FOMMCO made a special appearance, also moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction due to improper service under Rule 14, Sections 14 & 17 (now Rule 14, Sections 12 & 15 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure), arguing it was not doing business in the Philippines and Trans-World was not its agent.
*   **"Doing Business" Doctrine:** The Court addresses whether FOMMCO was "doing business" in the Philippines and whether the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to establish this for purposes of service of summons under Rule 14, Section 14.
*   **Agency Relationship:** The core issue is whether Trans-World was a valid agent of FOMMCO for service of summons. The Court emphasizes the need for specific allegations in the complaint to establish a connection between FOMMCO and Trans-World regarding the specific transaction, not just a general statement of agency.
*   **Voluntary Appearance:** FOMMCO raised concerns that filing an answer would constitute voluntary appearance and waive jurisdictional objections. The court notes that an appearance solely to contest jurisdiction does not constitute voluntary appearance.

**Ruling & Rationale:**

*   The Supreme Court ultimately **denied** FOMMCO's petition.
*   **Doing Business:** The Court found that the allegations in the complaint, specifically regarding the contract to supply and install machinery and the actual shipment of machinery, were sufficient to allege that FOMMCO was doing business in the Philippines *for purposes of service of summons*.  It clarifies that this determination is preliminary and subject to later rebuttal based on evidence. The citation of *Hahn v. CA, 266 SCRA 537* & *Litton v. Mills, Inc. v. CA, 326 Phil. 710* emphasizes this point.
*   **Agency:** The court recognized that while a simple allegation of agency is insufficient, the lower courts had factually assessed and found that FOMMCO treated Trans-World as its agent in the transaction. The court deferred to these factual findings, citing precedent such as *Willex Plastic Industries Corp. v. CA, 256 SCRA 478*, stating that it will not disturb factual findings supported by substantial evidence.  This finding on the specific facts related to this transaction is what distinguishes it from a broader statement of general agency.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 14, Sections 14 (now Section 12) and 17 (now Section 15) of the Rules of Court (Service of Summons on Foreign Corporations and Extraterritorial Service).

**Case Law References:**

*   *Signetics Corporation v. CA, 225 SCRA 737:* The Court clarifies that while the complaint must allege the foreign corporation has an agent in the Philippines, this alone does not suffice. The headnote of this case was misinterpreted in the courts below.
*   *Pacific Micronesian Lines, Inc. v. Del Rosario and Pelington, 96 Phil. 231:* Referenced regarding the necessity of allegations to support "doing business" claim.
*   *Hahn v. CA, 266 SCRA 537 and Litton v. Mills, Inc. v. CA, 326 Phil. 710:*  Establish the principle that for purposes of service, alleging doing business is sufficient, but the finding is tentative.
*   Cited cases regarding the finality of factual findings made by the trial court.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Finding of Agency:** The key risk for FOMMCO lies in the factual finding that it treated Trans-World as its agent. This is fact-specific and difficult to overturn on appeal given the deference afforded to lower courts.
*   **"Doing Business" Definition:** The tentative nature of the "doing business" determination implies potential for future disputes. While sufficient for service of summons, a different finding could arise during the merits phase of the case which could impact ultimate liability.
*   **Lack of Specificity in Complaint:** The Court emphasizes the need for specific allegations regarding the agent's connection to the transaction. This could be a point of contention if the complaint lacks sufficient details beyond the blanket statement of agency.

**Legal Advice:**

1.  **Analyze the Factual Basis of Agency:** Critically examine the factual basis upon which the lower courts determined that FOMMCO treated Trans-World as its agent. Identify any weaknesses or ambiguities in this finding.
2.  **Refine "Doing Business" Argument:** Prepare a strong argument demonstrating that even if FOMMCO supplied and installed machinery, this does not constitute "doing business" within the relevant legal definition for establishing general jurisdiction. Focus on the isolated nature of the transaction.
3.  **Consider Settlement:** Given the deference to factual findings, evaluate the potential for settlement to mitigate the risks associated with ongoing litigation.
