## Legal Document Summary - *Republic vs. CA and Tetro Enterprises*

**Case:** *Republic of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals, Hon. Pedro M. Sunga, Jr., and Tetro Enterprises, Inc.*, G.R. No. 130118, July 9, 1998.

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision upholding the RTC's ruling on just compensation for land taken by the government.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:** 12,643 sq.m. of land owned by Tetro Enterprises (TCT No. 283205-R) in San Fernando, Pampanga.
*   **Cause of Action:** Tetro Enterprises filed a complaint against the Republic for recovery of possession and damages, alleging that the government constructed a road on their property in 1974 without expropriation or negotiated sale.
*   **Initial RTC Decision:** Based on a board of commissioners' report, the RTC fixed the price of the land at P6,000.00 per sq.m. (totaling P75,858,000.00).
*   **Government's Appeal:** The government argued the RTC erred in basing compensation on current market value (1996) instead of the value at the time of taking (1974), citing *Alfonso v. Pasay City, Ministerio v. Court of First Instance, Amigable v. Cuenca, Municipality of La Carlota v. The Spouses Felicidad Baltazar, Ansaldo v. Tantuico, Jr*.
*   **Procedural Issue:** The government's motion for reconsideration was denied by the RTC and subsequently the Court of Appeals, because it did not have proof of service attached as required by Rule 15, Section 6, making it a "mere scrap of paper."

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Government Obligation:** To pay just compensation for the land taken.
*   **Disputed Liability:** The amount of just compensation owed by the government; based on the property value at the time of taking (Govt Argument) or current market value (RTC Decision).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Valuation Date:** The primary point of contention. The government risks paying a significantly higher price if the current market value prevails. *Alfonso v. Pasay City, Ministerio v. Court of First Instance, Amigable v. Cuenca, Municipality of La Carlota v. The Spouses Felicidad Baltazar, Ansaldo v. Tantuico, Jr*, generally support valuation at the time of taking.
*   **Procedural Non-Compliance:** The government's initial failure to properly serve the motion for reconsideration almost resulted in the loss of its right to appeal.
*   **Estoppel Argument:** Tetro Enterprises argued that the government is estopped from questioning the RTC's valuation because it was based on a report from a board that included government representation.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 15, ยง6 of the Rules of Court (now 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure):** Requires proof of service to be filed with motions. The court cites *De Rapisura v. Nicolas, People v. Leviste, Azajar v. Court of Appeals, Republic v. Court of Appeals* to allow substantial compliance with the Rule.
*   **Just Compensation Principles:**  The Supreme Court emphasized the significance of the government's argument that the basis of compensation must be based on the value of the property at the time of the taking (*Alfonso v. Pasay City*).
*   **Expropriation vs. Recovery of Possession:** Private respondent argues this is not an expropriation case, therefore the cited case law does not apply.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court REVERSED the Court of Appeals' decision.
*   Ordered the RTC to give due course to the government's appeal.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Supreme Court, while acknowledging the procedural lapse, prioritized the government's right to appeal, citing the significant amount of money involved and the apparent merits of its argument regarding the valuation date. The court emphasizes the necessity of deciding cases on their merits, as opposed to relying solely on procedural technicalities. The SC essentially relaxed the procedural rules to prevent injustice. The court highlighted that the fact that the government was represented in the determination of value by a board suggests that the appellate court should consider whether, in fact, the initial ruling of the RTC can be upheld on the merits.
