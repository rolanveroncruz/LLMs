**Subject: Summary of A.M. No. CA-23-001-P - Administrative Case re: Drug Use of CA Personnel**

**Nature:** This is a *Per Curiam* Decision of the Supreme Court (SC) resolving an administrative matter concerning the use of prohibited drugs by Court of Appeals (CA) personnel.

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Court of Appeals, Manila.
*   **Respondents:** Garry U. Caliwan (Messenger), Edmundo T. Malit (Records Officer I), and Frederick C. Mauricio (Utility Worker II).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Random Drug Test:** All three respondents tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) in a random drug test conducted by the CA on June 28, 2022.
*   **Prior Offense:** Respondents had previously tested positive for drug use in 2017 and completed a rehabilitation program.
*   **Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) Recommendation:** The JIB recommended dismissal for Caliwan and Malit, and forfeiture of retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits) and perpetual disqualification from public service for Mauricio (who retired early).
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The SC adopted the JIB's recommendations.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Caliwan and Malit:** Found guilty of Use of Prohibited Drugs or Substances.  Sanctioned with dismissal from service, forfeiture of retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits), and perpetual disqualification from public service.
*   **Mauricio:** Found guilty of Use of Prohibited Drugs or Substances.  Sanctioned with forfeiture of retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits), and perpetual disqualification from public service.

**Statutory/Regulatory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. (RA) 9165, as amended by RA 10640:** Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 (Violated by respondents' drug use).
*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC:**  Classifies Possession and/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances as a serious charge.
*   **A.M. No. 23-02-11-SC:** Guidelines for the Implementation of a Drug-Free Policy in the Philippine Judiciary. Specifies when a positive drug test constitutes grounds for administrative charges.

**Case Law:**

*   **Re: Louie Mark U. De Guzman, A.M. No. 2020-10-SC:**  Cited to support dismissal for proven use of drugs.
*   **Re: Administrative Charge of Misconduct Relative to the Alleged Use of Prohibited Drug of Castor, 719 Phil. 96:** Cited on the unacceptability of diminishing public trust in the Judiciary.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The SC explicitly acknowledged Caliwan's and Mauricio's cited mitigating circumstances (exemplary record, long service) but clarified that Rule 140's framework for mitigation does not apply when the sanction is dismissal.
*   **Retroactive Application of A.M. No. 23-02-11-SC:** The decision appears to apply A.M. No. 23-02-11-SC (approved April 18, 2023) to conduct occurring earlier (2022 drug test).  This could be challenged on grounds of retroactivity if A.M. No. 23-02-11-SC significantly altered the penalties or procedural rules applicable at the time of the offense.
*   **"Second Offense" Characterization:** The SC frames the 2022 positive test as a "second offense" despite respondents completing rehabilitation after the 2017 test. This could be challenged based on the intent and effect of the rehabilitation program. The legal definition of "second offense" in relation to completed rehabilitation programs is a potential point of contention.
