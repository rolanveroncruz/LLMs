**Legal Document Summary: Bank of America NT & SA v. Philippine Racing Club (PRCI), G.R. No. 150228**

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Facts:** PRCI pre-signed checks which were later stolen and encashed at Bank of America (BA). The checks contained irregularities: "CASH" typed as payee and the amount repeated with a check writer.
*   **Issue:** Whether the proximate cause of the loss was the bank's failure to verify the checks given the irregularities or PRCI's practice of pre-signing blank checks.
*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision with modifications. BA had the "last clear chance" to avoid the loss but failed to exercise due diligence. PRCI was also negligent in its pre-signing practices.
*  **Liability:** The SC allocated 60% of the liability to BA and 40% to PRCI due to contributory negligence. The CA's award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses in favor of PRCI was deleted.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Bank of America (Petitioner):**
    *   Obligation: Exercise a high degree of diligence in handling client accounts, exceeding that of a "good father of a family" due to the public interest nature of banking (Samsung Construction Company Philippines, Inc. v. Far East Bank and Trust Company, Inc., G.R. No. 129015).
    *   Liability: Primarily liable for 60% of the P220,000 due to its failure to verify the irregular checks. Held to have the "last clear chance" to prevent the loss (Westmont Bank v. Ong, G.R. No. 132560).
*   **Philippine Racing Club (Respondent):**
    *   Negligence: Contributory negligence for the risky practice of pre-signing blank checks without adequate internal controls.
    *   Liability: Bears 40% of its own loss due to contributory negligence (Art. 2179 of the Civil Code, Lambert v. Heirs of Ray Castillon, G.R. No. 160709).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **For Banks:** This case reinforces the stringent duty of care required of banks and highlights the potential liability for failing to investigate irregularities on checks, even in the presence of genuine signatures. The "last clear chance" doctrine may be applied even if the client's negligence contributed to the loss.
*   **For Corporations/Individuals:**  The case emphasizes the risks associated with pre-signing blank checks and the importance of establishing robust internal controls to prevent fraud.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "material alteration" argument by the petitioner was rejected, with the court emphasizing that "irregularities" on the check, even if not strictly alterations, should have prompted verification.
*   Application of Sec. 15 and 16 of the NIL: The Court ruled the checks are incomplete, therefore the argument of authority to fill blanks does not take precedence over the bank's responsibility to have acted with diligence when suspicious alterations should have been taken into consideration.
*   Allocation of responsibility: While the SC recognized PRCI's negligence, it assigned a greater portion of the loss to the bank due to its superior position to prevent the fraud. This allocation may be contentious in future cases depending on the specific facts and level of negligence of each party.
