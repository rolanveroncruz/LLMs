Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Ferdinand A. Dela Cruz and Renato A. Dela Cruz vs. Amelia G. Quiazon* (G.R. No. 171961, November 28, 2008)

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over land covered by a Certificate of Land Transfer (CLT) issued to Feliciano dela Cruz, the petitioners' father, under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 27. The respondent, Amelia G. Quiazon (heir of the original landowner), sought the cancellation of the CLT and the eviction of the petitioners, alleging abandonment and failure to pay rentals. The DARAB initially dismissed the complaint, but later granted a petition for relief from judgment filed by the respondent, canceling the CLT and ordering the petitioners to vacate, based on abandonment and the respondent's successful application for land retention. The Court of Appeals affirmed the DARAB.  The Supreme Court reversed the CA, reinstating the original DARAB decision dismissing the complaint.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **P.D. No. 27 (Operation Land Transfer):** Governs the transfer of land ownership to tenant-farmers.
*   **Certificate of Land Transfer (CLT):**  Evidences the grantee's qualification to acquire ownership but does not equate to full ownership. *Planters Development Bank v. Garcia, G.R. No. 147081, December 9, 2005*
*   **Conditions for Ownership:** Full ownership is acquired only after compliance with conditions for an Emancipation Patent. *Pagtalunan v. Tamayo, G.R. No. 54281, March 19, 1990*
*   **Landowner's Retention Rights:** Landowners can retain a portion of their land even under OLT.
*   **Abandonment:** Requires a clear intention to renounce rights and an external act expressing that intention.
*   **Personal Cultivation:** Can be fulfilled by the tenant or with the aid of immediate farm household. *Verde v. Macapagal, G.R. No. 151342, June 23, 2005*

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Cancellation of CLT:** Possible if conditions for Emancipation Patent are not met or if the land is subject to a valid retention claim. The DAR Secretary has jurisdiction for cancellation in relation to the land retention case and is not considered an agrarian dispute.
*   **Ejectment:** Possible if the tenant abandons the land or chooses to be a beneficiary of another agricultural land.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 27:** Emancipation of Tenants
*   **R.A. No. 6657, Sec. 6:** Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) - Tenant's Option upon Landowner's Retention.
*   ***Marcopper Mining Corporation v. Solidbank Corporation*, G.R. No. 134049, June 17, 2004:** legal personality of the party to the principal case is not lost by the mere transfer of the disputed property pendente lite.
*   ***Tenants of the Estate of Dr. Jose Sison v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 93045, June 29, 1992:** Sustained the authority of the DAR Secretary to cancel the CLT after landowners' right to retain the subject landholding was upheld.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Abandonment:** Whether the farmer-beneficiary's immigration to the U.S. constituted abandonment given that his son continued to cultivate the land.  The Court found no abandonment due to continued cultivation by a member of the immediate farm household.
*   **Petition for Relief from Judgment:** The Court found that the DARAB erred in granting the petition for relief from judgment due to the respondent's inexcusable negligence. The court ruled that the respondent had a copy of the decision served to her at her residence.
*   **DARAB vs. DAR Secretary Jurisdiction:** Whether the DARAB or the DAR Secretary has jurisdiction over the CLT cancellation. The court held that the DAR Secretary has jurisdiction over the CLT cancellation as the matter is strictly administrative implementation of agrarian laws.
*   **Validity of the Retention Order:** The petitioners challenged the validity of the DAR's retention order, alleging a denial of due process (lack of notice). The Supreme Court noted this could be raised before the DAR Secretary or in a separate action.

**Key Holding:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals, holding that the DARAB erred in granting the petition for relief from judgment and in canceling the CLT based on abandonment. The Court emphasized that the DAR Secretary, not the DARAB, has jurisdiction over the CLT cancellation as an incident of the order granting the landowners' application for retention over the said landholding.
