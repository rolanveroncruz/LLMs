## Legal Document Summary: *De Castro v. De Castro*, G.R. No. 172198

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld the RTC's orders that effectively prevented Petitioner, Ma. Lourdes C. De Castro, from presenting further evidence in a case for the declaration of nullity of marriage filed by Respondent, Crispino De Castro, Jr. The RTC deemed Petitioner to have waived her right to present further evidence due to repeated postponements requested by her, the last occurring even with a prior warning that no further postponements would be allowed.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Marriage Nullity:** Respondent filed for declaration of nullity based on psychological incapacity. The RTC initially granted the petition in 1998, finding both parties psychologically incapacitated.
*   **Petitioner's Motion for New Trial/Reconsideration:** Granted by the RTC based on Petitioner's claim that she was misled by the Respondent due to the promise of continuous adequate support for the children, and the transfer of title to their three children of their family home and another piece of real property.
*   **Repeated Postponements:** Numerous hearing dates (12 in total) were set. Several were postponed due to the Petitioner's requests, often made on the day of the hearing, citing reasons such as the Petitioner attending a business meeting for volunteer work or being in the US to care for her grandchild.
*   **Waiver of Right to Present Evidence:** The RTC, exasperated by the repeated postponements, eventually deemed that the Petitioner had waived her right to present further evidence when she failed to appear at the August 20, 2003 hearing, despite a prior warning.
*   **CA Decision:** Upheld the RTC's orders, finding no grave abuse of discretion. The CA emphasized the numerous postponements requested by the Petitioner and the prior warning issued by the RTC.
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court *affirmed* the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling that the Petitioner was not denied due process. The SC reiterated that the Petitioner created the situation through repeated, last-minute postponement requests and that the reasons for absence were foreseeable and avoidable.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligation to Present Evidence:** The Petitioner had the obligation to diligently present her evidence after the RTC granted her motion for a new trial.
*   **Timely Motion:** The Petitioner was obligated to file any motion for postponement in a timely manner.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Potential Liability for Adverse Judgment:** If the RTC's decision (after offer of exhibits and memorandum of authorities) is adverse to the Petitioner, the primary recourse is appeal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Adverse Judgment in Nullity Case:** The primary risk is an adverse judgment declaring the marriage null and void based on the Respondent's evidence and the existing record, which may be disadvantageous for the Petitioner regarding property division, support, or other related issues.
*   **Loss of Appeal:** Failure to properly preserve issues for appeal, or to meet deadlines in any appeal may lead to further loss.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code:** Implied reference throughout the document as the case concerns the declaration of nullity of marriage, and the determination that the parties are psychologically incapacitated to enter into marriage.
*   **Rules of Court (Rule 65):** The original Petition before the Court of Appeals was filed under Rule 65, regarding certiorari.
*   ***Ortigas, Jr. v. Lufthansa German Airlines*, G.R. No. L-28773:** Cited by the Supreme Court regarding a party's failure to present evidence due to their own negligence and being unable to claim denial of their day in court.
*   ***Hap Hong Hardware Co. v. Philippine Company*, G.R. No. L-16773:** Cited by the Supreme Court regarding unjustified reasons for postponement and the court's discretion in denying such motions.
*   ***Bachrach Motor Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations*, G.R. No. L-26136:** Cited regarding the completion of oral testimony, but found to not apply in this case.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Psychological Incapacity":** The document references the Respondent's claim of "psychological incapacity" under the Family Code, which is often a contentious legal issue requiring substantial evidence, including expert testimony. The initial granting of the nullity, and the later setting aside, illustrates the controversy of the claim.

**Recommendations:**

*   Focus on preserving the record for appeal.
*   Prepare compelling arguments for appeal, emphasizing any potential misapplication of the law, or misinterpretations of fact made by the trial court.
*   File the offer of exhibits as directed by the court.
*   Ensure strict compliance with all court orders and deadlines.
