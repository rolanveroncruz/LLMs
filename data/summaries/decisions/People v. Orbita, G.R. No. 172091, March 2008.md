**Case Summary: *People v. Orbita*, G.R. No. 172091**

**Nature:** Automatic review of a CA decision affirming with modification the RTC's conviction of Moises Orbita for Statutory Rape.

**Facts:** Accused-appellant Orbita was convicted of raping a 6-year-old girl (AAA) at her condominium. Key evidence includes AAA's testimony, corroborating testimony of bloodstains on AAA's underwear, and the medico-legal report confirming sexual abuse. Orbita presented alibi and denial as defenses, claiming the mother (BBB) fabricated the story due to ill feelings.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Elements of Statutory Rape Proven:** The court found sufficient evidence, primarily AAA's credible testimony, to establish that Orbita had carnal knowledge of AAA, a minor under 12 years of age.
*   **Credibility of Complainant's Testimony:** The SC emphasized the importance of the victim's testimony in rape cases. AAA's testimony was deemed credible despite minor inconsistencies (e.g., describing a male organ), considering her young age.
*   **Rejection of Defenses:** Orbita's alibi and denial were rejected for lack of substantiation and failure to outweigh the positive identification by the victim. The alleged ill motive of the mother was also dismissed due to lack of credible evidence and the unlikelihood of a mother using her child in such a manner.
*   **Application of R.A. 9346 (Death Penalty Abolition Act):** The initial death penalty was replaced with *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole, pursuant to R.A. 9346.
*   **Civil Liabilities:** Civil indemnity was increased to Php 75,000, moral damages to Php 75,000, and exemplary damages of Php 25,000 was awarded, following *People v. Audine*.

**Obligations:**

*   Orbita is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua* and is not eligible for parole.
*   Orbita is obligated to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to the victim AAA.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for statutory rape, resulting in imprisonment.
*   Civil liability for damages arising from the crime.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Sole Witness Testimony:** While the court upheld the conviction based largely on AAA's testimony, reliance on a single witness can be a point of scrutiny.
*   **Subjectivity of Credibility Assessment:** The court's assessment of AAA's credibility relies heavily on the trial court's observations, which can be subjective, despite guidelines established through case law.
*   **Defense Arguments:** The defense focused on inconsistencies and claimed ill motive, future litigation may explore the possible mis application of the guidelines in assessing the credibility of both parties.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9346:** An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty - This law dictated the modification of the penalty.
*   ***People v. Mateo***: This case guided the transfer of the case to the CA for intermediate review
*   ***People v. Audine***:  This case was used as precedent for the imposition of civil damages.
*   **R.A. 9262:** Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004 - referenced for withholding the victim's identity.
*   The Court cites established jurisprudence concerning credibility of witnesses, the relative weight of alibi and positive identification, and the assessment of ill motive.
