## Legal Document Summary: People v. Angeles y Arimbuyutan, G.R. No. 237355

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (Appeal from Court of Appeals)

**Case Summary:**  Accused-Appellant Angel Angeles was convicted by the RTC and CA for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 15 (illegal use) of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act). The Supreme Court REVERSED the conviction, ACQUITTING Angeles on grounds of reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Sections 5 and 15 of RA 9165:** These sections define and penalize the illegal sale and illegal use of dangerous drugs, respectively.
*   **Section 21 of RA 9165:**  This details the chain of custody requirements for seized drugs, including immediate inventory and photographing in the presence of the accused (or their representative), an elected public official, a media representative, and a DOJ representative.
*   **Section 38 of RA 9165**: mandates drug testing of apprehended individuals and that drug test results be challenged within 15 days.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution:** Bears the burden of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt, including compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 to establish the *corpus delicti* (the drug itself) and maintain its integrity. Failure to do so results in acquittal.
*   **Law Enforcement (Apprehending Team):** Obligated to strictly comply with the procedures outlined in Section 21, including proper inventory, photographing, and presence of required witnesses.  Also, adhering to PNP Drug Enforcement Manual.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21:** The crucial issue is the apprehending team's failure to comply with Section 21's requirements. Specifically, the inventory was not conducted at the place of arrest, and none of the required witnesses (DOJ, media, elected official) were present. The prosecution failed to provide *any* justifiable explanation for this deviation. This compromises the integrity of the evidence.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The lower courts erred in relying on the presumption of regularity in the performance of duties by police officers. This presumption cannot override the fundamental right of the accused to be presumed innocent. The absence of witness, along with the police's blatant disregard for established procedures negates the regularity performance duty.
*   **"Fruit of the Poisonous Tree" Doctrine:** Since the initial apprehension was deemed illegal due to non-compliance with Section 21, the subsequent drug test (violation of Section 38) is inadmissible under the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine.
*   **Court of Appeals Error Regarding Waiver:** The CA incorrectly stated that the defense waived the Section 21 issue by failing to cross-examine the police officers about it. The burden of proving compliance with Section 21 lies solely with the prosecution, and the accused does not need to present evidence to challenge the prosecution's case.
* The prosecutor is expected to acknowledge and recognize the lapse of non-compliance with RA 9165, and to justify them with evidence if a non-compliance has taken place.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002)**
*   **People v. Opiana, 750 Phil. 140 (2015):** Outlines elements of illegal sale.
*   **People v. Guzon, 719 Phil. 441 (2013):** Defines *corpus delicti* in drug cases and the importance of chain of custody.
*   **People v. Santos, 562 Phil. 458 (2007):** Emphasizes the need for strict compliance with procedures in drug cases to prevent abuse.

*   **People v. Lim, G.R. No. 231989 (2018):**  Clarifies the prosecution's burden to explain non-compliance with Section 21.
*   **People v. Umipang, 686 Phil. 1024 (2012):**  Stresses the need for genuine efforts to secure the attendance of required witnesses.
*   **People v. Catalan, 699 Phil. 603 (2012):**  States that presumption of regularity cannot override presumption of innocence.
*   **People v. Zheng Bai Hui, 393 Phil. 68 (2000)**: Outlines acts that the police might take credibly.
*   **People v. Alicando, 321 Phil. 656 (1995):** Explains the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine.
*   **PNP Drug Enforcement Manual (1999):** Prescribes internal procedures for anti-drug operations, which were also not followed.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "saving clause" in the IRR of RA 9165 regarding non-compliance with Section 21 only applies if the prosecution acknowledges and justifies the lapses.  In this case, the prosecution failed to do so, rendering the saving clause inapplicable.

**Legal Opinion:**

The Supreme Court's decision is well-reasoned and based on a strict interpretation of RA 9165 and relevant case law. The failure of the prosecution to establish an unbroken chain of custody, combined with the illegal arrest, renders the evidence inadmissible, and the acquittal is warranted. This case serves as a strong reminder to law enforcement of the importance of strict adherence to the procedural safeguards in RA 9165 to protect the rights of the accused and ensure the integrity of the evidence.
