**Legal Document Summary: Soriamont Steamship Agencies, Inc. vs. Sprint Transport Services, Inc. (G.R. No. 174610)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming with modification the RTC's decision in favor of Sprint for a Sum of Money. The dispute arises from a lease agreement (ELA) for chassis units.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Equipment Lease Agreement (ELA):** Between Sprint (Lessor) and Soriamont (Lessee) for chassis units. Contained an **automatic renewal clause (Paragraph 24)**.
*   **Equipment Interchange Receipt (EIR):** Document for chassis withdrawal/return, acknowledging chassis condition.
*   **Chassis Withdrawal/Return Slip:** Authorizes the Lessee's representative to withdraw/return chassis; signatory must be authorized.
*   **Agency Relationship:** Soriamont authorized Papa Transport Services (PTS) and Rebson Trucking to withdraw chassis units from Sprint.

**Obligations:**

*   **Soriamont:** Responsible for rental payments and return or replacement of chassis units leased from Sprint.
*   **PTS/Rebson Trucking:** Acted as agents of Soriamont in withdrawing the chassis.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Soriamont:** Held liable for unpaid rentals and the replacement cost of the lost chassis, based on the ELA and the agency relationship.
*   **Patrick Ronas:** Absolved of liability as he acted within his capacity as general manager of Soriamont.
*   **Ricardo Cruz Papa (PTS):** Absolved because no evidence showed PTS acted beyond or contrary to its authority as agent of Soriamont.

**Damages:**

*   Value of the two chassis units.
*   Unpaid rentals.
*   Attorney's fees.
*   Legal interest at 6% per annum, increased to 12% upon finality of the decision until full satisfaction.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Automatic Renewal Clause:** Soriamont argued the ELA expired, but the Court found it automatically renewed. This is a critical element of liability.
*   **Agency Relationship:** Soriamont contested the existence of an agency relationship with PTS and Rebson Trucking. The Court heavily relied on the authorization letters and Valencia's testimony to establish the agency.
*   **Scope of Agency:** Soriamont argued that PTS exceeded its authority, but failed to prove this. The burden of proof was on Soriamont.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Limits Supreme Court's review to errors of law.
*   **Article 1897 of the Civil Code:** Addresses agent's liability, but found inapplicable as PTS did not exceed authority.
*   **Article 2209 of the Civil Code:** Governs interest on damages.
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:** Determines the applicable legal interest rate and its accrual.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The primary ambiguity lies in the interpretation of the authorization letters and whether they definitively establish an agency relationship for the purpose of bearing liability for lost equipment and unpaid rentals.
*   The precise scope of PTS's agency is somewhat ambiguous, but the court decided that since Soriamont failed to prove PTS acted beyond its authority as an agent of Soriamont, PTS cannot be held liable to Sprint or Soriamont.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court denied Soriamont's petition, upholding the lower courts' decisions. Soriamont was liable to Sprint for unpaid rentals and the value of lost chassis units based on a valid Equipment Lease Agreement with an automatic renewal clause and the agency relationship established between Soriamont and PTS/Rebson Trucking. The legal interest rate was clarified. The key risk for Soriamont was the inability to disprove the agency relationship and the lack of evidence showing PTS acted beyond its authority. The Court consistently deferred to the factual findings of the lower courts.
