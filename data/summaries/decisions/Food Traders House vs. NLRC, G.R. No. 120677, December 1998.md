**Case Summary: Food Traders House, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission and Barbara A. Camacho-Espino (G.R. No. 120677, December 21, 1998)**

**Facts:**

*   Barbara Camacho-Espino was illegally dismissed from Food Traders House, Inc. (FTHI).
*   Labor Arbiter (LA) ruled in Espino's favor, ordering reinstatement and back wages, but allowed deduction of a personal loan from her salary.
*   The NLRC affirmed but modified, adjusting the amount deducted for earnings elsewhere and the loan amount, while also including additional back wages and 13th month pay.
*   FTHI appealed to the Supreme Court challenging the additional back wages and 13th month pay.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The SC affirmed the finding of illegal dismissal.
*   **Reinstatement:** Espino was eventually reinstated on July 4, 1994.
*   **Back Wages (Article 279, Labor Code as amended by RA 6715):**
    *   SC reversed the NLRC's deduction of Espino's earnings elsewhere during the pendency of the case. Cites *Bustamante v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 111651) emphasizing full back wages without deduction, in line with RA 6715's intent.
    *   The SC affirmed the award of back wages from the date of illegal dismissal (January 31, 1992) until the date of actual reinstatement (July 4, 1994), including 13th month pay, citing *Rasonable v. NLRC* (G.R. No.117195). This includes back wages accruing after the Labor Arbiter's initial decision.
*   **Personal Loan Deduction:** The SC *nullified* the garnishment of Espino's salary to pay off her personal loan to the President, Alinas.
    *   The LA lacked jurisdiction over the personal loan claim because it did not arise from an employer-employee relationship. References Article 217 of the Labor Code. Cites *Pondoc v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 116347) to clarify the limitations on the NLRC's appellate jurisdiction.
*   **Dispositive:** The NLRC decision was modified. Espino was awarded full back wages (inclusive of 13th-month pay and other benefits) from the date of dismissal to the date of reinstatement, without deductions for earnings elsewhere, and the garnishment for the personal loan was nullified.

**Obligations:**

*   FTHI is obligated to pay Espino full back wages (including 13th month pay and other benefits) from January 31, 1992, to July 4, 1994, without deducting earnings elsewhere.
*   FTHI is prohibited from deducting the amount of Espino's personal loan from her salary or any other compensation.

**Liabilities:**

*   FTHI is liable for the full amount of back wages, 13th month pay, and other benefits due to Espino from January 31, 1992, to July 4, 1994.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Non-compliance:** Failure to fully comply with the SC's order may result in further legal action, including contempt proceedings and additional penalties.
*   **Precedent:** This case solidifies the interpretation of Art. 279 (as amended) regarding full back wages and limits the jurisdiction of the LA/NLRC to matters arising from the employer-employee relationship.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The original computation of back wages by the LA and NLRC was flawed, and these initial figures should not be considered binding. The precise amount due needs to be recalculated based on the SC's ruling.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 279, Labor Code (as amended by RA 6715):**  Defines the rights of an illegally dismissed employee, including reinstatement and full back wages.
*   **Article 217, Labor Code:** Outlines the jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters, specifically excluding claims not arising from employer-employee relationship.

**Case Law:**

*   **Bustamante v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 111651, 28 November 1996:**  Interprets "full back wages" under RA 6715 to mean without deducting earnings elsewhere.
*   **Rasonable v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No.117195, 20 February 1996:**  Clarifies that back wages extend up to the actual reinstatement date.
*   **Pondoc v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 116347, 3 October 1996:** Defines the NLRCs appellate jurisdiction, limiting it to the exclusive original jurisdiction of the LA.
