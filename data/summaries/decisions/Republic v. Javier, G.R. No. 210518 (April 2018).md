## Legal Document Summary: Republic v. Javier (G.R. No. 210518)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Subject Matter:** Declaration of Nullity of Marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code (Psychological Incapacity)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Republic of the Philippines
*   **Respondents:** Martin Nikolai Z. Javier and Michelle K. Mercado-Javier

**Background:** Martin Javier filed a petition to declare his marriage to Michelle Javier null and void under Article 36 of the Family Code, alleging psychological incapacity on the part of both himself and Michelle.

**Lower Court Rulings:**

*   **RTC:** Dismissed the petition, finding insufficient evidence of psychological incapacity for either party.
*   **CA:** Reversed the RTC, granting the petition and declaring the marriage null and void, finding sufficient evidence of psychological incapacity for both parties.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** The legal basis for declaring a marriage void *ab initio* based on psychological incapacity rendering a party unable to comply with essential marital obligations.
*   **Psychological Incapacity Criteria:**  Relies on the *Santos v. CA* (310 Phil. 21) criteria of gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability. Also references *Republic v. Molina* (335 Phil. 664) guidelines, while acknowledging flexibility.
*   **Martin's Argument:**  Presented his own testimony and a psychological evaluation from Dr. Adamos, diagnosing both himself and Michelle with Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  Argued that personal examination of Michelle was not essential.
*   **Republic's Argument:**  Argued that Martin's testimony was self-serving and Dr. Adamos' findings lacked independent proof, particularly regarding Michelle's alleged incapacity, relying on hearsay evidence.
*   **Dr. Adamos' Testimony:** Diagnosed both parties with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Michelle's diagnosis was based on interviews with Martin and a friend, Jose Vicente. He also personally counselled Martin over a number of sessions.
*   **Court's Reasoning for Granting the petition in regards to Martin:** Dr. Adamos' diagnosis was based on more than 10 personal counselling sessions with Martin, during which he diagnosed him with narcissistic personality disorder with tendencies toward sadism rooted in childhood trauma. The Court found that these facts, uncontroverted by the Republic, proved the three essential characteristics of psychological incapacity on the part of Martin.
*   **Court's Reasoning for Denying the petition in regards to Michelle:**  The Court relied on *Rumbaua v. Rumbaua* (612 Phil. 1061), emphasizing the risk of relying solely on a petitioner-spouse's information to a psychologist.  The Court found that Dr. Adamos' conclusions about Michelle were based on insufficient information regarding her childhood and family history, as the narrations of Martin and Jose Vicente were deemed insufficient to establish the root cause or juridical antecedence of her incapacity.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court **PARTIALLY GRANTED** the petition.
*   The marriage was declared **NULL and VOID *AB INITIO*** due to the **psychological incapacity of Martin Nikolai Z. Javier** under Article 36 of the Family Code.
*   The CA decision was modified to reflect that the finding of nullity was solely based on Martin's incapacity, not Michelle's.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 36 of the Family Code:** This is the central legal provision. It forms the basis of the court's decision.
*   **Psychological evaluation:** Under the ruling in regards to Martin, it is a credible form of evidence.
*   **Disclosure of information from both parties:** Under the ruling in regards to Michelle, testimony by a friend, Jose Vicente, and Martin are not credible enough.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Impact on Child Custody:** The decision does not mention the specific arrangement for Amanda M. Javier. This is a significant issue that must be addressed in subsequent proceedings or by agreement between the parties.
*   **Property Division:** The nullity of the marriage will trigger the legal process for the division of conjugal property, if any.
*   **Future Claims:** The decision may preclude either party from raising similar arguments regarding the validity of the marriage in future proceedings.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Application of *Molina* Guidelines:** The decision reiterates adherence to *Molina* but also emphasizes a case-by-case approach. This creates some ambiguity in the weight given to each *Molina* guideline.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code**

**Case Law References:**

*   *Santos v. CA* (310 Phil. 21)
*   *Marcos v. Marcos* (397 Phil. 840)
