**Case Summary: *Aldeguer & Co., Inc./Loalde Boutique v. Honeyline Tomboc*, G.R. No. 147633 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision reversing the NLRC's ruling that upheld the Labor Arbiter's dismissal of the respondent employee's illegal dismissal complaint.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Employment:** Respondent was employed as Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of Loalde Ayala Boutique with responsibilities including inventory monitoring, coordination with the area manager, supervision of sales staff, and implementation of company rules.
*   **Termination:** Petitioner terminated respondent for alleged misappropriation of P28,137.70 (Art. 282, Labor Code) and delaying cash deposits. The basis was an audit and reports from cashiers.
*   **Procedural Issues:** The Labor Arbiter initially deemed the case submitted without the petitioner's position paper but later admitted it. The CA reversed, citing grave abuse of discretion for the late admission.
*   **Just Cause:** Petitioner alleged respondent failed to deposit cash sales and committed other irregularities, including a cash shortage and falsifying deposit slips. The NLRC and Labor Arbiter found just cause for termination.
*   **Due Process:** The CA found a lack of due process as the respondent was not given an opportunity to refute the misappropriation charge. The Supreme Court disagreed on the denial of due process issue.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer (Petitioner):** Requirement to provide procedural due process in termination proceedings, including two written notices (notice of investigation with specific charges and potential consequences, and a notice of termination).
*   **Employee (Respondent):** Duty of honesty and trust, adherence to company policies, and proper handling of funds as OIC.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner:** Found liable for nominal damages (P30,000) due to non-compliance with procedural due process requirements of two notices, citing *Agabon v. NLRC* (2004). Termination was for a just cause, but procedurally flawed.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Late Filing of Position Paper:** The CA initially held that admitting the petitioner's late-filed position paper constituted grave abuse of discretion, citing *Mañebo v. NLRC* (1994). The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that failure to submit a position paper on time is not a ground for striking it from the record and respondent was furnished a copy of petitioner's Position Paper on February 6, 1998.
*   **Scope of OIC Responsibilities:** The respondent argued that her job description didn't include handling cash; the petitioner countered that she did handle cash in emergencies, presenting testimonies claiming respondent interfered with cashiering tasks. The Court noted that it had been established that while a boutique-in-charge is ordinarily not allowed to handle cashiering, she may do so, however, if the need arises.
*   **Due Process Compliance:** The core contention revolved around whether the notice of termination satisfied the requirements of *Maquiling v. Philippine Tuberculosis Society, Inc.* (2005). The single notice issued was deemed insufficient.
*   **Interpretation of "Fraud or Willful Breach of Trust":**  This ground for termination under Art. 282(c) of the Labor Code was the subject of factual scrutiny.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 282:** Just causes for termination by employer.
*   **Rules Implementing Book VI, Rule I, Section 2:** Requirements for termination based on just causes.
*   ***Agabon v. NLRC* (2004):** Established the principle of nominal damages for termination with just cause but lacking procedural due process.
*   ***Mañebo v. NLRC* (1994):** Discussed the role of procedural rules in the NLRC and the importance of due process, as well as the repercussions if not done properly.
*   ***Maquiling v. Philippine Tuberculosis Society, Inc.* (2005):** Defined the requirements of the first notice in termination proceedings.
*   ***ABS-CBN Broadcasting Network v. Nazareno* (2006):** Reiterates that a Labor Arbiter is mandated by law to use every reasonable means to ascertain the facts of each case speedily and objectively, without technicalities of law or procedure, all in the interest of due process.
*   ***Rural Bank of Alaminos Employees Union v. NLRC* (1999):** Lack of verification of petitioner's position paper is only a formal, not a jurisdictional, defect.
*   ***Perpetual Help Credit Cooperative, Inc. v. Faburada* (2001):** Such single notice does not comply with the requirements of the law.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, finding just cause for the termination but holding the employer liable for nominal damages due to a failure to comply with procedural due process. The case highlights the importance of proper termination procedures, particularly the two-notice rule, even when just cause exists. The decision reinforces the *Agabon* doctrine.
