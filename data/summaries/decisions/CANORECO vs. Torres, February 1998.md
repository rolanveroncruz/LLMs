**Legal Document Summary: *Camarines Norte Electric Cooperative, Inc. (CANORECO) vs. Hon. Ruben D. Torres***

**Case:** G.R. No. 127249, February 27, 1998

**Nature:** Original action for certiorari and prohibition under Rule 65.

**Key Issue:** Validity of the President's Memorandum Order No. 409 (December 3, 1996) constituting an Ad Hoc Committee to take over and manage CANORECO.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, declaring Memorandum Order No. 409 INVALID. The order was issued due to infighting among the members of CANORECO, and the ad hoc committee to handle the day-to-day operations was established to resolve these issues. The Court held that the President lacked the constitutional and statutory authority to take over and manage an electric cooperative that had registered under R.A. No. 6938 (Cooperative Code) and R.A. No. 6939 (creating CDA).

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **R.A. No. 6938 (Cooperative Code):**
    *   Article 38: Vests conduct and management of cooperative affairs in the board of directors.
    *   Article 39: Delineates powers of the board of directors.
    *   Article 43: Outlines the officers of the cooperative and their appointment/election, specifying removal only for cause and after due hearing.
    *   Article 51: Governs the removal of directors and officers by a two-thirds vote of the voting members.
    *   Article 98: Governs the Regulation of Public Service Cooperatives; the internal affairs are governed by the law.
    *   Article 121: Mandates amicable settlement of intra-cooperative disputes via conciliation/mediation, followed by court action if unsuccessful.
    *   Article 122: States electric cooperatives fall under the code.
    *   Article 128: Cooperatives created under P.D. 269 must register with CDA.
*   **R.A. No. 6939 (Creating CDA):**
    *   Section 8: CDA mediates/conciliates disputes; issues a certificate of non-resolution after 3 months if mediation fails.
    *   Section 17: Cooperatives created under P.D. 269 must register with CDA.
*   **P.D. No. 269 (National Electrification Administration Decree, as amended by P.D. No. 1645):** Sections 3 and 5 (Authority for NEA Administrator to designate acting General Manager) deemed inapplicable to CANORECO after registration with CDA under R.A. 6938 and 6939.
*   **Administrative Code of 1987 (EO 292):** Section 15, Chapter III, Book VII: Decisions of administrative agencies become final after 15 days unless appealed.

**Liabilities/Potential Risks:**

*   **Ultra Vires Act:** The President's action (issuance of MO 409) was deemed beyond the powers granted by law and the Constitution.
*   **Violation of Due Process:** The removal/suspension of the incumbent board of directors and appointment of an Acting General Manager without due process.
*   **Interference with Internal Affairs:**  The takeover violated the principle of non-interference in cooperative management.
*   **Intra-Cooperative Disputes:**  Failure to follow the statutory dispute resolution mechanism (mediation/conciliation followed by court action) could lead to further litigation.

**Case Law:**

*   *Antique Sawmills, Inc. v. Zayco*, 17 SCRA 316 (1966):  Reiterates the principle that administrative decisions should have finality.

**Statutory References:**

*   R.A. No. 6938 (Cooperative Code of the Philippines)
*   R.A. No. 6939 (Creating the Cooperative Development Authority)
*   P.D. No. 269 (National Electrification Administration Decree, as amended by P.D. No. 1645)
*   Administrative Code of 1987 (Executive Order No. 292)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The indefinite timeframe for the Ad Hoc Committee's takeover ("until such time as a general membership meeting can be called...") introduced uncertainty and potential for abuse.
*   The "relegation of petitioners as mere advisers" without clear definition of their roles and responsibilities created ambiguity regarding their status and authority.
*   The lack of a clear statutory basis for the takeover provided the main basis for the Court's decision.

**Conclusion:** The Court's decision emphasized the importance of adhering to statutory procedures for resolving intra-cooperative disputes and limiting executive interference in cooperative management.  Any future interventions by the executive branch in cooperative affairs must be grounded in explicit constitutional or statutory authority, respecting due process and the principles of cooperative autonomy.
