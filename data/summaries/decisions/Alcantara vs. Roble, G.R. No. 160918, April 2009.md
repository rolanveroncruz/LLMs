## Legal Document Summary: *Alcantara v. Templa*, G.R. No. 160918 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the Court of Appeals' decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision in a partition case.

**Subject Matter:** Dispute involving five parcels of land (Lots 1-5) inherited by siblings Jesusa, Candelario, Columba, Gervasio, and Concepcion Booc (hereinafter referred to as siblings) from their parents/grandparents, specifically regarding the validity of various transfers and waivers made over the years.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Co-ownership & Partition:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's holding that an action for partition among co-owners is imprescriptible based on Art. 494 of the Civil Code and case law such as *Aguilar vs. Court of Appeals, 227 SCRA 472* and *Salvador vs. Court of Appeals, 243 SCRA 239*.

*   **Lot 1 (Lot No. 2464):** TCT No. 7849 was found defective for excluding Candelario. The partition was limited to the remaining 129 sq.m. after expropriation and sales to Marienela Rama and Antonio del Prado. The CA allocated specific portions of this remaining land to the heirs based on previous conveyances.

*   **Lot 2 (Lot No. 2361):** The SC upheld the CA's decision to partition Lot 2 in accordance with the Extrajudicial Settlement (Exhibit "5"), with the caveat that Candelario's waiver (Exhibit "4") was valid only for him and Jesusa did not waive her share. TCT No. 1243 in the name of Concepcion Alcantara was deemed partially void insofar as it included the share of Jesusa Roble.

*   **Lot 3 (Lot No. 336):** The CA and SC affirmed partition, excluding the heirs of Candelario Booc due to their waiver.

*   **Lot 4 (Lot No. 2360):** The SC upheld the CA's decision that Exhibit "P" (partition document) was void as it deprived Jesusa and Candelario of their rightful shares. TCT No. 1526 issued in the name of Concepcion Alcantara was deemed void with regards to shares of Jesusa and Candelario. Partition was ordered with each sibling getting 613 sq.m.

*   **Lot 5 (Lot No. 2393):** The CA affirmed partition pursuant to Exhibit "5" with each of the siblings, except Concepcion, getting 4,167 sq.m.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Concepcion's Estate:** Held liable for deficiencies in shares allocated due to prior invalid conveyances and waivers. Specifically, the CA determined that over sales by Concepcion in Lot 1 needed to be compensated via reductions of her share in other lots.

*   **Heirs of Concepcion:** Responsible for the correct partition and distribution of the properties as ordered, accounting for the invalid conveyances and waivers made by Concepcion.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Ownership & Transfers:** Much of the dispute hinges on the validity and authenticity of the transfers and waivers. Lack of documentation or conflicting documents led to adverse rulings.

*   **Determination of Good Faith:** The CA touched on the subsequent purchasers in good faith, particularly with relation to the lots conveyed by the heirs. The CA puts burden on the plaintiff-appellees to prove that the subsequent purchasers were in bad faith.

*   **Falsification Issue:** Although not central to the ruling, the mention of a *prima facie* finding of falsification against Concepcion potentially raises concerns.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Basis for the petition for review.
*   **Civil Code (Art. 494):** Imprescriptibility of action for partition.
*   **Rules on Evidence:** Weight and admissibility of documents.
*   **Land Registration Act:** Issues of defective TCT (TCT No. 7849) and validity of registration.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, resolving factual issues regarding the validity of transfers and waivers related to the inherited properties. The decision mandates a partition of the properties, accounting for valid and invalid transactions, and holds Concepcion's estate liable for deficiencies arising from her actions. The SC reiterates the principle that questions of fact, particularly regarding the weight of evidence, are not reviewable under Rule 45. Further investigation into the mentioned falsification and the status of subsequent purchasers may be warranted.
