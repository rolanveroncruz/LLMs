Here's a summary of the legal document, tailored for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Henry Ching Tiu, Christopher Halin Go, and George Co vs. Philippine Bank of Communications* (G.R. No. 151932, August 19, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of Petition for Certiorari assailing RTC orders allowing substitution of an allegedly falsified Surety Agreement.

**Facts:**

*   Asian Water Resources, Inc. (AWRI), represented by Petitioners, obtained a loan from PBCOM, secured by real estate collateral and later unsecured loan guaranteed by a Surety Agreement executed by Petitioners (AWRI directors).
*   AWRI failed to pay, PBCOM demanded payment from Petitioners as sureties, and filed a collection suit (Civil Case No. 99-352).
*   Petitioners claim the Surety Agreement was falsified *after* they signed it by inserting the words "In his personal capacity" without their consent. They presented a certified copy from the Records Management and Archives Office lacking this phrase.
*   PBCOM admitted the insertion was done *after* execution by a bank auditor, *without* notifying the notary, to comply with internal procedure. They sought to substitute the altered copy of the Surety Agreement with the original notarial copy.
*   RTC allowed the substitution. CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Surety Agreement:** The core of the dispute centers around the enforceability of the Surety Agreement. The specific clause "In his personal capacity" is critical to determining individual liability.
*   **Amendment of Pleadings (Rule 10, Section 3, Rules of Court):** PBCOM successfully argued for amendment (substitution of the document), relying on the Court's discretion to allow amendments, even substantial ones, to serve justice and expedite proceedings. *Valenzuela v. Court of Appeals* (416 Phil. 289 (2001)) is cited regarding liberalization of amendment rules.
*   **Actionable Document (Rule 8, Section 7, Rules of Court):** The court considered the original Surety Agreement the best evidence, justifying the substitution.
*   **Certiorari (Rule 65, Rules of Court):** The Supreme Court addressed whether the CA committed a reversible error in affirming the order of the lower court allowing the substitution of the falsified document.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** PBCOM seeks to hold Petitioners liable as sureties for AWRI's debt.  Petitioners are arguing that the altered document is invalid. Their liability depends on the validity and interpretation of the Surety Agreement, specifically whether they agreed to be personally liable.
*   **PBCOM:** Has the burden to prove the validity and enforceability of the Surety Agreement. The unauthorized alteration, even if well-intentioned, creates doubt and potential liability for falsification.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Falsification:** The unauthorized insertion raises questions of fact and law related to potential falsification. Although a civil case, potential criminal implications exist (not directly addressed but mentioned by the Court).
*   **"In his personal capacity":** The meaning and effect of this phrase are paramount. Even without the clause, the court may still find the individuals liable under standard principles of surety law (not fully explored in the decision).
*   **Due Process:** Petitioners argue that allowing the substitution of the document would prevent them from introducing the falsified document during the trial as part of their evidence.
*   **Premature Adjudication by CA:** The Supreme Court specifically notes that the CA erred in making determinations about the parties' rights under the Surety Agreement, as this should be determined by the RTC during trial.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition. The RTC did not err in allowing the substitution of the Surety Agreement.  However, the CA was cautioned against prematurely ruling on the merits of the case. The case is remanded to the RTC for further proceedings.
