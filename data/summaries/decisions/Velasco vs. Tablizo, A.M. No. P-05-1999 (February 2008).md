## Legal Document Summary: *Velasco v. Tablizo*

**Case:** A.M. No. P-05-1999, *Angeles A. Velasco v. Atty. Prospero V. Tablizo*

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Atty. Prospero V. Tablizo, Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio Provincial Sheriff, for gross neglect of duty and refusal to perform official duty.

**Key Provisions:**
*   **Respondent's Duty:** As Ex-Officio Provincial Sheriff, respondent had a ministerial duty to implement writs of execution issued by the MTC (Rules of Court, Rule 39, Sections 9, 10, and 14). This included ejectment, property restoration, collection of payments, levy on properties, and reporting to the court.
*   **Failure to Act:** Respondent received writs of execution in Civil Case Nos. 489 and 466 (issued May and February of 1999) but failed to implement them. He did not demand payment, levy on properties, eject defendants, restore possession, or file reports as ordered by the Court.
*   **Respondent's Silence:** Respondent repeatedly failed to file comments to the complaint despite multiple directives from the OCA and the Supreme Court. This silence was interpreted as an admission of guilt.
*   **Penalty:** The Court found Respondent guilty of gross neglect of duty and refusal to perform official duty. As Respondent had retired, dismissal was not possible; thus, he was fined P40,000.

**Obligations:**
*   Respondent had a legal and ministerial obligation to execute valid writs of execution promptly and efficiently according to the Rules of Court.

**Liabilities:**
*   Respondent was found liable for gross neglect of duty and refusal to perform official duty, both classified as grave offenses under the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**
*   The document does not clarify if the decision in civil cases 466 and 489 where based on appeals or if the facts of the case are not being disputed.
*   **Mitigation:** The fact that Respondent compulsorily retired before a disciplinary action could be imposed (other than a fine) reduced the impact of any disciplinary action against him.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** The document suggests two separate complaints filed by the complainant on or about the same incident. The document does not address or refer to double jeopardy.
*  **Other Pending Cases:** the document does not discuss the disposition of the other pending cases

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 39, Sections 9, 10, and 14:**  Governs the execution of judgments.
*   **Bautista v. Orque, Jr., A.M. No. P-05-2099:**  Affirms the sworn duty of ex-officio sheriffs to enforce writs.
*   **Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Classifies gross neglect of duty and refusal to perform official duty as grave offenses.
*   **Badoles-Algodon v. Zaldivar, A.M. No. P-04-1818:**  Reinforces the responsibilities and liabilities of sheriffs in implementing writs.

**Recommendations/Areas for Further Investigation:**
*   **25 February 2000 Complaint:** The OCA is directed to investigate the charges contained in this complaint.
*   The Court notes that complainant filed two different complaints against respondent â€” one dated 4 February 2000 and another dated 25 February 2000. In the 25 February 2000 sworn letter-complaint, complainant charged respondent with gross neglect of duty and grave misconduct for refusing to execute the final and executory judgments in Civil Case Nos. 1571, 1617, and 494. Determine any overlapping issues with the current case.
