**Case Summary: *Pedro Chico v. Court of Appeals and Mananghaya*, G.R. No. 122704 (1998)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals decision which annulled the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision in an action for recovery of possession (accion publiciana).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Main Issue:** Whether the dispute is agrarian in nature and falls under the jurisdiction of the DARAB, or is a simple case of recovery of possession cognizable by the RTC. The CA sided with DARAB jurisdiction, the Supreme Court reversed.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The Supreme Court reiterated the established principle that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint (citing *Sarmiento vs. CA, 250 SCRA 108; Santos vs. CA, 214 SCRA 162*). The complaint was for recovery of possession.
*   **Tenancy Relationship:** The Court outlines the essential elements of a tenancy relationship (citing *Cuaño vs. CA, 237 SCRA 122*): landowner/tenant, agricultural land, consent, agricultural production, personal cultivation, and harvest sharing. The Court found these elements were NOT adequately established by the private respondents.
*   **Evidence:** The private respondents failed to provide sufficient evidence (e.g., receipts, agreement) to prove the existence of a tenancy relationship and profit sharing. Self-serving statements are insufficient.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Pedro Chico (Petitioner):** Entitled to possession of the disputed lot.
*   **Martin & Leonila Mananghaya (Respondents):** Obligated to vacate the subject lot and surrender its possession to Pedro Chico. They are liable for costs.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Evidence of Tenancy:** The critical flaw in the private respondents' case. They failed to demonstrate the existence of a valid tenancy agreement or the fulfillment of its elements.
*   **Factual Disputes:** The nature of the land (agricultural vs. residential) was disputed, and the Court sided with the petitioner's characterization, noting its location near a highway. This implies an inherent conflict between the parties' assertions, which can be the subject of potential appeal if new convincing and relevant evidence is brought forward.
*   **Procedural Lapse:** The private respondents initially failed to appeal the RTC decision and instead filed a petition for certiorari, which the Supreme Court implicitly criticizes as an attempt to circumvent the proper appellate process.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **E.O. No. 229 & No. 129-A; R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Cited by the private respondents to argue for DARAB jurisdiction.
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Used improperly by private respondents as a substitute for a lost appeal.
*   ***Cuaño vs. CA, 237 SCRA 122***: Cited for the elements of tenancy.
*   ***Sarmiento vs. CA, 250 SCRA 108; Santos vs. CA, 214 SCRA 162***: Cited for the principle that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeals' decision, emphasizing the lack of evidence to support a tenancy relationship. The RTC decision ordering the private respondents to vacate the land was reinstated. The primary legal risk for the private respondents is the finality of the Supreme Court's ruling.
