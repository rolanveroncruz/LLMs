## Legal Document Summary: Professional Video, Inc. vs. TESDA (G.R. No. 155504)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision nullifying the RTC's order of attachment/garnishment against TESDA's properties.

**Key Issue:** Validity of the writ of attachment against TESDA and its funds.

**Holding:** Petition DENIED. CA affirmed. RTC order issuing writ of attachment against TESDA was invalid due to sovereign immunity and failure to establish grounds for attachment.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Contract Agreement (Dec. 29, 1999) & Addendum (Aug. 24, 2000):** PROVI to provide PVC ID card system and related supplies; TESDA to pay P39,475,000. PROVI claims non-payment of P35,735,500.
*   **PROVI's Argument:** TESDA waived immunity by entering into a commercial contract (selling PVC cards). RTC did not abuse its discretion in issuing writ of attachment due to TESDA's alleged fraudulent misapplication of funds (supported by fund availability certification).
*   **TESDA's Argument:** TESDA is a government instrumentality performing governmental functions (skills standardization, testing, and certification) and is immune from suit. Funds are public funds exempt from garnishment. PROVI failed to comply with requirements for a valid writ of preliminary attachment.
*   **Court's Reasoning:**

    *   **Sovereign Immunity:** TESDA is an unincorporated instrumentality of the government performing governmental functions under R.A. No. 7796 and thus enjoys sovereign immunity, citing *Constitution, Article XVI, Section 3*.
    *   **Governmental vs. Proprietary Function:** Issuance of PVC cards deemed incidental to TESDA's governmental function of skills certification, therefore maintaining immunity; *Mobil Philippines v. Customs Arrastre Services*.
    *   **Public Funds:** Even with implied consent to suit, TESDA's funds (sourced from General Appropriations Act) are public funds and exempt from attachment/garnishment, citing *Republic v. Villasor* and *Traders Royal Bank v. Intermediate Appellate Court.*
    *   **Failure to Establish Grounds for Attachment (Rule 57, Rules of Court):** PROVI failed to prove "fraudulent misapplication or conversion of funds." Mere non-payment is insufficient to establish fraud; *Wee v. Tankiansee*. Reliance on Section 1(b), Rule 57 of the Rules of Court requires embezzlement or conversion by a public officer, which PROVI did not prove.
    *   Section 86 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 states that amount stated in Certification should be intact and devoted to its purpose since original appropriation, PROVI did not rebut this.
    *   Section 1 (d), Rule 57 of the Rules of Court requires the applicant to sufficiently show the factual circumstances of the alleged fraud because fraudulent intent cannot be inferred from the debtor's mere non-payment of the debt or failure to comply with his obligation.

*   *Wee v. Tankiansee* (G.R. No. 171124)

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Governmental Function":** The court's characterization of PVC card issuance as an integral part of TESDA's governmental function could be debated. Arguments could be made that it is a separate, income-generating activity.
*   **Fraud Allegation:** PROVI may argue that TESDA's non-payment, despite the Certificate of Fund Availability, constitutes constructive fraud or a breach of good faith, even if not amounting to criminal fraud.
*   **"Implied Consent" Exception:** The Court clearly indicated that even if there was consent to be sued, public funds cannot be garnished.
*   **PROVI has not shown that it is entitled to the writ of attachment.**

**Overall, the decision heavily favors TESDA based on established principles of sovereign immunity and the protection of public funds. PROVI faces significant legal hurdles in recovering the alleged outstanding balance.**
