**Legal Document Summary: _A.C. No. 13842, Atty. Wilfredo Garrido, Jr. vs. Atty. Lorenzo Gadon_**

**Nature:** Administrative case for disbarment filed by Atty. Garrido, Jr. against Atty. Gadon based on (1) alleged falsehoods in an impeachment complaint against then Chief Justice Sereno and (2) filing of baseless criminal cases.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Impeachment Complaint Falsehoods:** The Court found Gadon GUILTY of Gross Misconduct. Gadon made a false representation and statements based on hearsay and not of personal knowledge or authentic record and therefore violated Section 11 of Canon II of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA). His verification of the impeachment complaint, attesting to the truth of allegations based on personal knowledge or authentic records, was found to be perjurious (violating RPC provisions on perjury).
*   **Baseless Criminal Cases:** The IBP-CBD and the Court found that the charge of Gadon filing baseless cases against Supreme Court officials was unsubstantiated by evidence. No penalty was imposed in relation to this charge.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Lawyer's Duty of Candor:** The Court emphasized a lawyer's duty to present truthful information and to avoid making accusations without factual basis. *Park v. Choi* was cited to stress the importance of verification.
*   **Accountability under CPRA:** Gadon violated Section 11 of Canon II of the CPRA by making false statements.
*   **Penalty:** Due to Gadon's existing disbarment in *In Re: Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon 's Viral Video Against Raissa Robles*, a new disbarment cannot be imposed. However, a fine of PHP 150,000.00 is imposed, pursuant to *Felix v. Gadon* and the Court's power to regulate lawyers before their disbarment. Gadon is now INELIGIBLE FOR JUDICIAL CLEMENCY as well.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA):** Canon II, Section 11 (False Representations); Canon VI Section 42.
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC)**: Provisions on perjury may be relevant in assessing the seriousness of the false verification.
*   **Constitution:** Reference to Art. XI, Sec. 3(2) highlights the importance of a verified impeachment complaint.
*   **_Republic v. Sereno_, 831 Phil. 271 (2018):** Distinguished to show that it does not exculpate Gadon. The quo warranto case primarily focused on Sereno's qualifications at the time of her appointment, not on the truthfulness of Gadon's specific allegations.
*   **_Park v. Choi_, 544 Phil. 431 (2007):** Emphasizes the importance of a proper verification.
*   **_Spouses Donato v. Asuncion_, 468 Phil. 329, 335-336 (2004):** Defines Gross Misconduct.
*   **_Lampas-Peralta v. Ramon_, 848 Phil. 277, 286 (2019):** Distinguishes Gross Misconduct from Simple Misconduct.
*   **_In Re: Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon 's Viral Video Against Raissa Robles_, A.C. No. 13521:** Previous disbarment case for Gadon.
*   **_Felix v. Gadon_, A.C. No. 13253:** Previous case where a fine was imposed on Gadon.
*   **_Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Cavite v. Atty. Mas_, A.C. No. 8219:** Ruling on ineligibility for judicial clemency for repeat offenders.

**Aggravating Circumstances:**

*   **Repeat Offender:** Prior disciplinary actions against Gadon.
*   **Lack of Remorse:** Gadon's refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing and assertion that *Republic v. Sereno* validated his claims.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Hearsay Evidence:** The core issue revolves around Gadon's reliance on hearsay, raising questions about the diligence and ethical considerations he undertook before filing the impeachment complaint.
*   **Impeachment as a Tool:** The Court implies that Gadon may have misused the impeachment process, potentially setting a precedent for frivolous or politically motivated impeachment attempts.
*   **Judicial Clemency:** The declaration of ineligibility for judicial clemency could be challenged based on arguments of due process or cruel and unusual punishment.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the finding of Gross Misconduct against Atty. Gadon. While Gadon cannot be disbarred again due to his prior disbarment, he was fined PHP 150,000.00 and declared ineligible for judicial clemency, and the penalty of disbarment was recorded in his personal file. This decision underscores the importance of truthfulness and diligence in legal practice, especially when initiating serious actions like impeachment proceedings.
