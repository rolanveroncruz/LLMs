**Legal Document Summary: Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction Co. Ltd. v. Felicito Iba√±ez, et al. (G.R. No. 170181, June 26, 2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) ruling. The CA declared respondents regular employees illegally dismissed by petitioner Hanjin.

**Key Issue:** Whether respondents were regular or project employees of Hanjin.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision, holding that the respondents were regular employees illegally dismissed.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Article 280 of the Labor Code:** Defines regular vs. project employees. Crucial point: whether employees were assigned to a "specific project or undertaking," the duration and scope of which were specified *at the time* of engagement.
*   **DOLE Department Order No. 19, Series of 1993 (Guidelines Governing Employment of Workers in the Construction Industry):**
    *   Section 2.2: Indicators of project employment (reasonably determinable duration, defined in employment agreement, reported termination to DOLE).
    *   Section 3.4: Completion Bonus (must be based on an *undertaking* to grant; absence implies non-project employee).
    *   Clause 3.3(a): Absent a 'day certain' for termination, project employees with at least one year of continuous employment in construction are considered regular employees.
*   **Employer's Burden of Proof:** In illegal dismissal cases, the employer bears the burden to prove the validity of the dismissal with clear, accurate, consistent, and convincing evidence.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Hanjin found liable for illegally dismissing regular employees.
*   **Monetary Awards:** Hanjin obligated to pay respondents full backwages, separation pay, and litigation expenses. Note: Moral and exemplary damages, as awarded by the Labor Arbiter, were deleted by both the NLRC and CA, and that determination was not challenged to the Supreme Court.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   **Absence of Employment Contracts:** Critical issue is Hanjin's failure to produce employment contracts *at the Labor Arbiter stage* that specified the project-based nature of the employment. This shifts the burden heavily against Hanjin. *Grandspan Development Corporation v. Bernardo* and *Audion Electric Co., Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission* were cited to support this.
*   **Inconsistent Employer Stance:** The employer's shifting arguments regarding the existence of employment contracts and the respondents' status were detrimental to their defense.
*   **Termination Report:** The singular termination report filed *only* upon termination of final project was viewed as suspicious and unconvincing, especially since Respondents claimed, and the Petitioner failed to refute, prior assignments to other projects.
*   **Completion Bonus:** The payment, characterized as a "completion bonus," lacked a prior undertaking/agreement and was computed incorrectly, as the amounts were tied to a 15-day salary payment rather than according to length of service, weakening Hanjin's position.
*   **Quitclaims:** Quitclaims are viewed with disfavor and are not effective to bar claims if they are wangled or unconscionable. Here, the consideration was inadequate.
*   **Due Process Violation:** Failure to provide notice and hearing prior to termination further supports the finding of illegal dismissal.
*   **Reliance on ALU-TUCP v. NLRC:**  Distinguish cases where re-hiring *doesn't* confer regular status. In this instance, the specific circumstances led the Court to believe the employees were assigned to multiple projects before the "termination" for LRT/MRT line 2.
*   **In sum:** Hanjin failed to demonstrate that the employees were informed of their status as project employees and/or they were provided due process before their employment was terminated.
