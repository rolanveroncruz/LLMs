**Case Summary: Heirs of Tomas Arao vs. Heirs of Pedro Eclipse, G.R. No. 211425 (2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision reversing the RTC's dismissal of a case for Declaration of Nullity of Deed of Absolute Sale, Reconveyance, Recovery of Ownership and Possession with Damages.

**Key Facts:**

*   Dispute over Lot No. 1667, originally under OCT No. 1546 owned by Policarpio Eclipse.
*   Respondents (Heirs of Eclipse) allege a 1969 Deed of Absolute Sale from Policarpio Eclipse to Tomas Arao (petitioners' predecessor) is a forgery as Policarpio was already dead. This resulted in TCT No. T-13798 in Tomas' name, then a subsequent transfer of the lot from Tomas to his children Eulalia, Proceso and Felipa Arao
*   Petitioners (Heirs of Arao) claim ownership via a 1940 Deed of Sale from the children of Policarpio Eclipse to Paulino Arao (Tomas' brother), and then through succession and a 1949 Deed of Sale from Gavino Arao (alleged heir of Paulino) to Tomas.

**Lower Court Rulings:**

*   **RTC:** Dismissed the case based on laches, finding the 1969 Deed of Sale a forgery but holding that respondents slept on their rights for over 30 years.
*   **CA:** Reversed, finding that the action based on a void contract is imprescriptible under Article 1410 of the Civil Code, upholding the forgery, but ordered reconveyance to the Eclipse Heirs.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Partially Granted** the petition.
*   **Affirmed** the CA's declaration of nullity of the 1969 Deed of Sale (forgery). Consequently, it also declared Transfer Certificates of Title No. T-13798 and T-39071 NULL and VOID for being issued based on the aforesaid forged and fictitious Deed of Sale dated September 5, 1969
*   **Declared Valid** the 1940 Deed of Sale.
*   **Declared** the petitioners to be the LAWFUL owners and possessors of the subject Lot No. 1667 by virtue of the valid Deed of Sale dated June 25, 1940.
*   **Directed** parties to execute pertinent documents required by law to effect the issuance of a new Transfer Certificate of Title in favor of petitioners.

**Key Provisions & Legal Principles:**

*   **Article 1410, Civil Code:**  An action to declare the inexistence of a void contract does not prescribe. Applied to the forged 1969 Deed.
*   **Forgery:** A forged deed is a nullity and conveys no title.
*   **Laches:** Doctrine inapplicable where the underlying claim is based on a void contract (imprescriptible action). *Heirs of Ingjug-Tiro v. Spouses Casals*
*   **Good Faith:**  Negated by petitioners' admission of knowledge of the forgery in the 1969 Deed. *Spouses Reyes v. Montemayor*
*   **Reconveyance:**  A remedy available only to rightful owners.
*   **Unregistered Deeds:** A valid and binding instrument between the parties thereto even if said deeds of sale were not registered with the Register of Deeds, since registration is not a requirement for validity of the contract as between the parties, and a valid conveyance between grantor, grantor's heirs, and those with actual notice. *Cuizon v. Remoto*
*   **Constructive Notice:** Registration in a public registry creates constructive notice to the whole world. *Rotairo v. Alcantara*

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Requirement of Execution of Documents for New TCT:** Parties may dispute the "pertinent documents required by law" leading to further litigation if a mutual agreement cannot be reached.

**Analysis:**

The SC affirmed the validity of the 1940 Deed of Sale and effectively quieted title in favor of the Heirs of Arao. While declaring the 1969 deed void, the SC did not automatically grant reconveyance to the Heirs of Eclipse, recognizing the superior claim of the Heirs of Arao based on the earlier, valid deed. The directive to execute further documents for TCT issuance introduces a possibility of future disputes but ultimately clarifies the rightful ownership.
