## Legal Document Summary: People v. De Guzman, G.R. No. 122740

**Case:** Appeal of a rape conviction. Accused-appellant Winston de Guzman was convicted of rape by the Regional Trial Court of Mati, Davao Oriental.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** De Guzman was charged with rape under force, violence, and intimidation of Jovelyn A. Geram on June 9, 1994.
*   **Complainant's Testimony:** Jovelyn testified that De Guzman entered her home, covered her mouth, and raped her, causing pain, bleeding, and white fluid discharge. Medical examination confirmed ruptured hymen and blood clots.
*   **Defense:** De Guzman claimed alibi, stating he was in Davao City with his mother attending to a sick relative.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** Convicted De Guzman, finding Jovelyn's testimony credible and rejecting the alibi.

**Obligations:**

*   The accused has an obligation to present a credible defense and disprove the accusations against him.
*   The prosecution has the obligation to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime of rape.

**Liabilities:**

*   De Guzman found guilty by the trial court and sentenced to reclusion perpetua, and ordered to indemnify Jovelyn in the amount of P40,000.00, and to pay the costs.
*   The court decision increased the indemnity to P50,000.00.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Impeachment Attempt:** Appellant attempted to impeach complainant's credibility based on alleged inconsistencies between her preliminary investigation testimony and trial testimony regarding the method of rape (odorous chemicals vs. force). This failed because the defense did not properly lay the predicate for impeachment per **Rule 132, Section 13 of the Rules of Court** (failure to confront the witness with the prior inconsistent statements and give her an opportunity to explain).
*   **Complaint Admissibility:** Appellant also attempted to use complainant's original complaint to demonstrate inconsistencies, but this was rejected as the complaint was not formally offered in evidence during the trial.
*   **Alibi Weakness:** The alibi was deemed weak due to reliance on familial testimony (**intrinsic weakness of alibi**) and presence of other prosecution witnesses placing him at or near the scene of the crime.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 132, Section 13, Rules of Court:** Governs impeachment of witnesses via inconsistent statements.
*   **People vs. Resabal, 50 Phil. 780 (1927):** Requires prior declarations to be read to the witness for explanation before being used for impeachment.
*   **U.S. vs. Baluyot, 40 Phil. 385 (1919):** lays down the predicate for laying foundation of evidence.
*   **Villaruel vs. Bascon, CA-G.R. No. L-24588-R:** Unless the proper predicate is laid during the trial by calling the attention of a witness to his alleged inconsistent statements given outside of his testimony in court and asking him to explain the contradiction, the supposed inconsistencies cannot be pointed out on appeal for the purpose of destroying the credibility of the witness.
*   **People vs. Escosura, 82 Phil. 41 (1948):** Previous statements cannot serve as bases for impeaching the credibility of a witness unless his attention was first directed to the discrepancies and he was then given an opportunity to explain them.
*   **People vs. Lim Quingsy, 54 Phil. 88 (1929):** Unless the proper predicate is laid during the trial by calling the attention of a witness to his alleged inconsistent statements given outside of his testimony in court and asking him to explain the contradiction, the supposed inconsistencies cannot be pointed out on appeal for the purpose of destroying the credibility of the witness.
*   **People vs. Peralta, G.R. No. 94570, September 28, 1994, 237 SCRA 218; Republic vs. Sandiganbayan, et al., G.R. Nos. 112708-09, March 29, 1996, 255 SCRA 438:** the courts shall consider no evidence which has not been formally offered or whose purpose has not been specified.
*   **Section 8, Rule 112, Rules of Court:** Records of the preliminary investigation do not form part of the record of the case in the Regional Trial Court.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Points:**

*   The appeal hinges on the credibility of the complainant and the procedural correctness of the trial court proceedings regarding impeachment. The inconsistent statements were not presented to the complainant for explanation.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, finding that the lower court correctly assessed the credibility of the witnesses and followed proper procedure. The failed impeachment attempts and weak alibi strengthened the prosecution's case.
