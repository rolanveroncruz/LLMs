## Legal Document Summary: *PDIC v. Stockholders of Intercity Savings and Loan Bank, Inc.* (G.R. No. 181556)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari concerning the liquidation of Intercity Savings and Loan Bank, Inc. (Intercity Bank)

**Parties:**
*   Petitioner: Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC), as liquidator of Intercity Bank
*   Respondents: Stockholders of Intercity Savings and Loan Bank, Inc.

**Key Issue:** Whether Section 12 of RA 9302, allowing for the payment of surplus dividends to creditors from a closed bank's assets, should be applied retroactively to the liquidation of Intercity Bank.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that RA 9302 cannot be applied retroactively.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PDIC's Motion:** PDIC sought court approval for:
    *   Reimbursement of liquidation expenses (P3,795,096.05).
    *   Provision for future expenses (P700,000.00).
    *   Write-off of assets (P8,270,789.99) and liabilities (P1,562,185.35).
    *   Approval of the Final Project of Distribution.
    *   Authorization for PDIC to act as trustee for unclaimed dividends, with eventual escheat to the Republic of the Philippines.
    *   Authorization to dispose of bank records after one year.
*   **Section 12 of RA 9302:** Allows PDIC, as liquidator, to charge liquidation expenses against the closed bank's assets and pay surplus dividends to creditors after all liabilities and claims have been paid.
*   **Effectivity Clause of RA 9302 (Section 28):** Specifies the law takes effect 15 days after publication, indicating prospective application.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **PDIC's Potential Liability:** If RA 9302 were applied retroactively, PDIC could be liable for distributing surplus dividends that it did not previously account for.
*   **Stockholders' Risk:** Retroactive application would diminish the amount available for distribution to shareholders after satisfying creditor claims and liquidation expenses.
*   **Unclaimed Dividends:** Ambiguity exists regarding who holds the unclaimed dividends, as the court rejected PDIC's request to act as trustee. This raises a risk of mismanagement or loss of funds before escheatment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 9302 (RA 9302):** Amended the charter of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation. Section 12 specifically addresses the distribution of assets and surplus dividends in bank liquidations.
*   **Civil Code Article 4:** Reinforces the principle of prospective application of laws unless explicitly stated otherwise.
*   **Rule 41 and 45, Rules of Court:** Delineate the proper procedure for appeals, including the distinction between ordinary appeals and petitions for review on certiorari based on questions of law.
*   **Quezon City v. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation, G.R. No. 166408, October 6, 2008:** Cited regarding the appropriate mode of appeal when only a question of law is involved.
*   **Curata v. Philippine Ports Authority, G.R. Nos. 154211-12, June 22, 2009:** Reaffirms the principle that statutes are generally prospective.
*   **Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 54470, May 8, 1990:** Foreign Jurisprudence may only be persuasive if there is no local law or jurisprudence exists.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The denial of PDIC's request to act as trustee for unclaimed dividends creates ambiguity regarding the management and control of these funds until the escheatment period lapses. This may necessitate further court action to appoint a trustee.
*   Stockholders' argument that the payment of additional liquidating dividends (vs surplus) should be deemed approved.

**Conclusion:**

This case confirms the principle of prospective application of laws. While the Court ultimately decided the case on its merits "in the interest of justice", it highlighted the procedural error committed by PDIC in appealing to the Court of Appeals when the issue was purely one of law. Further, the ruling clarifies that RA 9302 does not apply retroactively to liquidations commenced prior to its enactment. Lawyers advising PDIC on similar cases should be mindful of the appropriate appellate procedure and the general rule of prospective application of laws. The ambiguity regarding unclaimed dividends warrants further attention to ensure their proper management.
