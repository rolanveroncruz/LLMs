## Legal Document Summary: *Atty. David B. Corpuz vs. Court of Appeals and MTRCB* (G.R. No. 123989)

**Case Summary:** This case concerns the legality of Atty. David Corpuz's termination from the MTRCB, where he served as Attorney V. The core issue is whether his appointment was valid, considering the MTRCB's failure to approve it, despite Chairman Morato's initial appointment.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **P.D. No. 1986 (Creating the MTRCB), Sec. 5:** Outlines the powers and duties of the MTRCB Chairman, including recommending appointments.
*   **P.D. No. 1986, Sec. 16:** Vests in the MTRCB Board the power to approve or disapprove the appointments of personnel, excluding the Secretary.
*   **MTRCB Resolution No. 8-1-91:** Declared appointments of administrative and subordinate employees as null and void due to non-compliance with Sec. 5 of P.D. No. 876-A and P.D. No. 1986. It also mandated recommendation and approval of old or new appointees.

**Liabilities:**

*   The MTRCB could be liable for back salaries and benefits to Corpuz if his termination was deemed illegal.
*   The Court did not find the MTRCB liable and ruled that the action was not illegal.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Appointment:** The central risk revolves around whether Corpuz's appointment was valid. While initially appointed by the Chairman, MTRCB Board approval was lacking, casting doubt on its validity, especially after Resolution No. 8-1-91.
*   **Security of Tenure:** Corpuz's claim to security of tenure hinges on the validity of his appointment. If the appointment was incomplete, he lacks security of tenure.
*   **Resolution No. 8-1-91 Implementation:** Delayed announcement of the contents of the resolution creates questions of good faith and possibly violating Corpuz's due process rights.
*   **CSC Resolution No. 93-5964:** the CSC initially sided with Corpuz citing that the appointment was presumed to be made after complying with all the legal requirements. The court ruled that this was not enough and sided with the MTRCB.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Tomali vs. Civil Service Commission (238 SCRA 572):** Emphasizes compliance with legal requirements for a valid appointment. Absence of approval by the relevant authority prevents vesting of permanent title.
*   **Favis v. Rupisan (17 SCRA 190):** Held that the tolerance or acquiescence of officials resulting in non-observance of rules does not validate an incomplete appointment.
*   **Mechem, Law of Public Office and Officers, ยง112:** Defines the point at which an appointment is complete, emphasizing the need for any required consent or confirmation.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of P.D. No. 1986, Sec. 5 & 16:** The interaction between the Chairman's power to recommend appointments and the Board's power to approve them is contentious. The court sided with the interpretation that Board approval is mandatory for a valid appointment.
*   **Effect of Chairman's Appointment without Board Approval:** Whether the Chairman's appointment alone is sufficient to create a valid appointment or merely a *de facto* appointment is highly contentious.

**Conclusion:**

The Court sided with the MTRCB, ruling that Atty. Corpuz's appointment was incomplete due to the lack of Board approval, thus he did not acquire security of tenure. Consequently, his termination was deemed legal. The court emphasized the importance of adhering to legal requirements for appointments and rejected the argument that years of service could substitute for incomplete appointments. The key risk for Corpuz was the absence of MTRCB Board approval for his appointment which, under P.D. No. 1986, was deemed essential for its validity.
