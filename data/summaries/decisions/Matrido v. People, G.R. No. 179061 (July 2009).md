**Case Summary: _Matrido v. People_, G.R. No. 179061 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a conviction for qualified theft.

**Key Facts:**

*   Sheala Matrido, a credit and collection assistant for Empire East Land Holdings, Inc., collected P22,470.66 from a client but remitted only P4,470.66, pocketing the difference of P18,000.00.
*   Empire East filed estafa and other complaints after discovering discrepancies in Matrido's remittances.
*   Matrido paid P162,000.00 to Empire East, leading to the dismissal of some complaints, but not the case for P18,000.00 as admitted liability was 400,000.00.
*   The Information charged her with qualified theft under Art. 310 in relation to Arts. 308 and 309 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).
*   The trial court convicted her of qualified theft, a decision affirmed by the Court of Appeals (CA).

**Key Provisions and Elements of Qualified Theft (Art. 310, RPC):**

*   Taking of personal property.
*   Property belongs to another.
*   Taking without the owner's consent.
*   Intent to gain (animus lucrandi).
*   No violence or intimidation against persons or force upon things.
*   Taking done with grave abuse of confidence.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Liability:** Found guilty of qualified theft.
*   **Obligation:** Ordered to pay Empire East Land Holdings, Inc., P18,000.00.
*   **Penalty:** Sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 10 years and 1 day of prision mayor, as minimum, to 14 years, 8 months and 1 day of reclusion temporal, as maximum.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense Argument Rejection:** The court rejected the defense's argument that the prosecution attempted to prove estafa rather than theft, violating Matrido's right to be informed of the accusation. The court emphasized that the Information clearly alleged the elements of qualified theft. _Andaya v. People, G.R. No. 168486 (2006)_ was cited concerning the right to be informed.
*   **Distinction Between Theft and Estafa:** The court distinguished theft from estafa, noting that theft involves taking, while estafa involves receiving and converting property.  The critical factor is whether the accused had *material* or *juridical* possession.  Matrido only had material possession, making the crime theft, not estafa.  _Santos v. People, G.R. No. 77429 (1990)_ was referenced in this regard.
*   **Employee vs. Agent Argument Dismissed:** The court dismissed the argument that Matrido was an agent, not an employee, citing her pre-trial stipulation and testimony admitting her employment.
*   **Penalty Calculation:**  The court modified the maximum penalty imposed. The penalty for qualified theft is two degrees higher than simple theft. Amount stolen in this case was P18,000.00. Penalty should be prision mayor in its minimum and medium periods. Two degrees higher than this penalty is reclusion temporal in its medium and maximum periods or 14 years, 8 months and 1 day to 20 years. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum shall be prision mayor in its maximum period to reclusion temporal in its minimum period or within the range of 10 years and 1 day to 14 years and 8 months. Mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender being present, the maximum penalty shall be the minimum period of reclusion temporal in its medium and maximum periods or within the range of 14 years, 8 months and 1 day to 16 years, 5 months and 20 days.
