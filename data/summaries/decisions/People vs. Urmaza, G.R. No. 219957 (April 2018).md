## Legal Document Summary: People v. Urmaza (G.R. No. 219957)

**Case Summary:**

This is an appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Eleuterio Urmaza for qualified rape under Art. 266-A par. 1-a of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by RA 8353. The victim, AAA, is a deaf-mute diagnosed with mental retardation. Urmaza admitted to sexual intercourse with AAA but claimed it was consensual. Both the RTC and CA found him guilty, but the Supreme Court (SC) modified the ruling, convicting him of simple rape due to a defect in the information.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Initially charged with qualified rape under Art. 266-A par. 1-a of the RPC, as amended, alleging AAA was "demented" (deaf-mute).
*   **Facts Established:** Urmaza admitted to sexual intercourse with AAA. Prosecution proved, and Urmaza admitted knowledge of, AAA's mental retardation through expert testimony (Dr. Caoile), a Psychiatric Evaluation Report, and Urmaza's own admission during cross-examination.
*   **Victim's Testimony:** The SC highlights the importance of the victim's testimony and notes that the victim's ability to describe the event coherently strengthens the credibility of her claim of being raped.
*   **"Sweetheart Defense" Rejected:** Urmaza's claim of consensual relationship was dismissed due to lack of corroborating evidence (tokens, photos, etc.), in accordance with People v. Eco Yaba, 742 Phil. 298, 306 (2014).
*   **Incapacity to Consent:** The court recognized that a woman suffering from mental retardation is legally incapable of consenting to sexual acts, citing People v. Brion, 717 Phil. 100, 109 (2013).
*   **Error in Designation:** While the Amended Information referred to AAA as "demented," the SC clarified this was inaccurate as the evidence showed mental retardation. The SC distinguished dementia (characterized by marked decline) from being "deprived of reason" (mental retardation). This distinction is crucial as the Revised Penal Code specifically differentiates between someone who is "demented" and someone "deprived of reason" which includes mental abnormality, deficiency, or retardation. People v. Caoile, 710 Phil. 564 (2013) and People v. Ventura, 729 Phil. 566 (2014) were cited in defining the term "demented."
*   **Procedural Defect:** The Amended Information failed to explicitly allege that Urmaza *knew* of AAA's mental retardation. This omission proved to be a critical point in the decision.
*   **Impact of Defect:** While affirming the evidence of Urmaza's guilt, the SC *modified* the conviction to *simple rape*. The qualifying circumstance (knowledge of the mental disability) was not properly pleaded in the Amended Information, and was not alleged as a circumstance which raises the crime to a higher category.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Art. 266-A, par. 1-a:** Definition of Rape.
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Art. 266-B, par. 10:** Defines qualified rape and provides that knowledge of the offender of the victim's mental disability at the time of the commission of rape qualifies the crime and makes it punishable by death under Article 266-B, paragraph 10 of the RPC, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353.
*   **Republic Act No. 8353:** Amends certain provisions of the RPC, including those related to rape.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 110, Sections 8 and 9:** Requirements for specifying qualifying circumstances in the information.

**Case Law References:**

*   **People v. Caoile, 710 Phil. 564 (2013):** Defines "demented" and the distinction from "deprived of reason."
*   **People v. Ventura, 729 Phil. 566 (2014):** Defines "demented"
*   **People v. Eco Yaba, 742 Phil. 298, 306 (2014):** Rejection of "sweetheart defense" without corroborating evidence.
*   **People v. Brion, 717 Phil. 100, 109 (2013):** Incapacity of mentally retarded individuals to consent.
*    **People v. Tagud, 425 Phil. 928-950 (2002):** Purpose of Information.

**Potential Risks & Issues:**

*   **Defective Information:** The primary legal issue is the defective information. The failure to allege Urmaza's knowledge of AAA's mental condition resulted in a reduced conviction.
*   **Due Process Violation:** Convicting Urmaza of qualified rape without properly alleging the qualifying circumstance would have violated his right to due process. As elucidated in People v. Tagud, the purpose of the information is to alert the accused that his life hangs in the balance because a special circumstance would raise the crime to a higher category.

**Conclusion:**

Urmaza was ultimately found guilty of *simple rape* due to a procedural flaw in the Amended Information, which failed to allege the qualifying circumstance of his knowledge of the victim's mental retardation. While the facts supported the prosecution's case, this case serves as a critical reminder of the need for precise and complete indictments, including allegations of all essential elements and qualifying circumstances, to uphold due process and prevent reversal or modification of convictions. The decision hinged on strict interpretation of procedural rules (Rule 110, Secs. 8 & 9) regarding the pleading of qualifying circumstances in the information, and the failure to properly allege the element of knowledge led to a significantly reduced penalty.
