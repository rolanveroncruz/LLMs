## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 257723

**Case Name:** AURORA O. ARAGON-MABANG v. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN

**Court & Division:** Supreme Court, Third Division

**Date:** April 01, 2024

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmation of the Office of the Ombudsman's (OMB) decision finding Mabang guilty of Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **PDAF Allocation:** Cong. Datumanong allocated PHP 3,800,000.00 from his 2012 Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) for a livelihood project to be implemented by the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF).
*   **NGO Selection:** Cong. Datumanong requested NCMF to implement the project through Maharlikang Lipi Foundation, Inc. (MLFI).
*   **Disbursement Vouchers (DVs):** Mabang, as Acting Chief of the Management Audit Division (MAD), signed two disbursement vouchers (DVs) that led to the release of funds to MLFI.  The 1st DV was signed on July 30, 2012, *before* the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was notarized on August 10, 2012.
*   **OMB Findings:** The OMB found Mabang and others guilty of Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, citing violations of GPPB Resolution No. 12-2007 (no public bidding), COA Circular No. 2007-001 (improper NGO selection), and the release of funds prior to the MOA.
*   **CA Affirmation:** The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the OMB's decision.
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court modified the ruling.  Mabang was found **GUILTY of Simple Misconduct only**, due to the lack of evidence of corruption, willful intent, or conspiracy. The signing of the 1st DV before the MOA's notarization constituted a transgression, but not grave misconduct.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Mabang's Obligation:** Mabang, as Acting Chief of MAD, had the obligation to ensure the completeness of supporting documents before signing DVs.
*   **Liability:** Mabang found liable for Simple Misconduct for signing the 1st DV *prior* to the MOA, violating COA Circular No. 2007-001.  Penalty: Suspension for six (6) months without pay.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Applicability of GPPB Resolution No. 12-2007:** The court clarified that Resolution 12-2007 requires specific earmarking of funds for NGO projects in the appropriation law, which was absent in the 2012 GAA.  This reduces the potential risk of liability based on lack of public bidding.
*   **COA Circular No. 2007-001:** The case hinges on the interpretation of COA Circular No. 2007-001 and its requirement for proper evaluation and selection of NGOs.  The court found compliance with the Circular's accreditation process, mitigating risk except for the premature DV signing.
*   **Belgica v. Ochoa (721 Phil. 416 (2013)):** The court notes that the *Belgica* ruling against legislator intervention in budget execution applies prospectively. The NGO was selected by the legislator, but at a time when it was allowable.
*   **Conspiracy:** The OMB alleged conspiracy, but the SC found no evidence linking Mabang to the NGO selection or any personal benefit from the transaction, thus negating Grave Misconduct.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **GPPB Resolution No. 12-2007:**  Regarding procurement of NGOs.
*   **COA Circular No. 2007-001:** Revised Guidelines on Funds Released to NGOs.
*   **Republic Act No. 10155:**  The 2012 General Appropriations Act (GAA).
*   **Republic Act No. 9184:**  The "Government Procurement Reform Act".
*   **Belgica v. Hon. Exec. Sec. Ochoa, Jr. (721 Phil. 416 (2013)):**  Regarding the unconstitutionality of legislator intervention in budget execution.
*   **Sadain v. Office of the Ombudsman, G.R. No. 253688, February 8, 2023:** Clarifies the inapplicability of GPBB Resolution No. 12-2007 to the situation at bar.

**Conclusion:**

The key takeaway is that while Mabang was initially found liable for Grave Misconduct, the Supreme Court reduced the liability to Simple Misconduct.  The absence of evidence of corruption, conspiracy, and willful intent to violate the law, coupled with clarification on the applicability of GPPB Resolution No. 12-2007, significantly mitigated the severity of the offense.
