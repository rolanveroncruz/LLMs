## Legal Document Summary: *International Container Terminal Services, Inc. vs. FGU Insurance Corporation*, G.R. No. 161539

**Case Overview:**

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) ruling that International Container Terminal Services, Inc. (ICTSI), the arrastre contractor, is liable to FGU Insurance Corporation (FGU) for the loss of a shipment of silver nitrate insured by FGU. FGU, as subrogee of the consignee (Republic Asahi Glass Corporation - RAGC), sought reimbursement after ICTSI failed to deliver the shipment.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Arrastre Contractor's Liability:** ICTSI, as the arrastre contractor, is responsible for the loss or damage to cargo under its custody.
*   **Insurance Subrogation:** FGU, as the insurer, is subrogated to the rights of the consignee RAGC, allowing it to pursue claims against ICTSI.
*   **PPA Administrative Order No. 10-81 (PPA AO 10-81):** This Administrative Order is a management contract between Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) and cargo handling service providers. It limits the liability of the contractor to P3,500 per package unless the value is declared in writing. The Court ruled that ICTSI should be held for the actual amount of loss, not the limited liability, as the value of the shipment was made known to them before its discharge.
*   **Marine Insurance Policy:** Marine Open Policy covers all goods to be shipped by RAGC while the Marine Risk Note specifies the particular shipment insured.

**Liabilities:**

*   **ICTSI:** Found liable for the value of the lost shipment of silver nitrate.
*   **Initially, RTC awarded 1,875,068.88 but court modified this to P1,835,068.88.**

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Limitation of Liability (PPA AO 10-81):** ICTSI argues for a liability limit of P3,500 per package under PPA AO 10-81. However, the Court finds the limitation inapplicable because ICTSI had actual knowledge of the shipment's higher value through the presented shipping documents and their failure to charge the corresponding arrastre fees. *Summa Insurance Corporation v. Court of Appeals* is cited regarding the binding nature of management contracts on consignees and their insurers.
*   **Insurance Policy Validity/Offer in Evidence:** ICTSI argues the Marine Open Policy was no longer in force. FGU claims the shipment was covered under a Marine Risk Note. ICTSI also argued that FGU failed to offer the insurance policy in evidence, citing *Home Insurance Corporation vs. Court of Appeals* and *Wallem Philippines Shipping, Inc. vs. Prudential Guarantee and Assurance, Inc.* The Court found the presentation of the policy not fatal, citing *Delsan Transport Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, because the loss occurred in ICTSI's custody, the policy's existence was admitted, and its provisions are not in issue.
*   **Interest Rate (12% vs. 6%):** ICTSI challenges the 12% interest rate. Citing *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals* and *Prudential Guarantee and Assurance Inc. v. Trans-Asia Shipping Lines, Inc*, the court affirmed the 12% interest rate due to the judgment becoming final and executory which deems it as a forbearance of credit.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1311 of the Civil Code:** Stipulation pour autrui (stipulation in favor of a third party).
*   **Philippine Ports Authority Administrative Order No. 10-81 (PPA AO 10-81):**  Management contract limiting arrastre operator's liability.

*   ***Home Insurance Corporation vs. Court of Appeals* (225 SCRA 411):** Discusses the necessity of presenting insurance policies as evidence.
*   ***Wallem Philippines Shipping, Inc. vs. Prudential Guarantee and Assurance, Inc.* (G.R. No. 152158, 07 February 2003):** Affirmed the need to present an insurance contract to determine extent of coverage.
*   ***Delsan Transport Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (420 Phil. 824, 835 (2001)):** Exceptions to the rule of presenting an insurance policy.
*   ***Prudential Guarantee and Assurance Inc. v. Trans-Asia Shipping Lines, Inc.* (G.R. No. 151890,June 20, 2006, 491 SCRA 411):** Application of interest to obligations.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The applicability of the liability limitation clause in PPA AO 10-81 is the central point of contention. ICTSI argues for its application, while FGU contends it should not apply because ICTSI was informed of the real amount.
*   The validity of the Marine Open Policy at the time of the shipment is also disputed. FGU claims the shipment was insured through a Marine Risk Note, even if the original policy was cancelled.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court denied ICTSI's petition and affirmed the CA's decision, with a modification in the award amount (P1,835,068.88 instead of P1,875,068.88)
