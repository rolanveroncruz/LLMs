## Legal Document Summary: Yu v. Yukayguan, G.R. No. 177549

**Case Overview:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) Resolutions which reversed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) dismissal of a Complaint in SRC Case No. 022-CEB, an intra-corporate dispute.  The CA remanded the case to the RTC for resolution of "corporate concerns" pertaining to the dissolution of Winchester Industrial Supply, Inc. (Winchester, Inc.). The Supreme Court (SC) granted the petition, reversing the CA resolutions and affirming the RTC's dismissal.

**Key Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Anthony S. Yu, Rosita G. Yu, and Jason G. Yu (Yu Family)
*   **Respondents:** Joseph S. Yukayguan, Nancy L. Yukayguan, Jerald Nerwin L. Yukayguan, and Jill Neslie L. Yukayguan (Yukayguan Family), on their own behalf and on behalf of Winchester, Inc.

**Factual Background:**

The Yu and Yukayguan families are stockholders in Winchester, Inc. The Yukayguans filed a derivative suit and direct action for accounting, inspection of corporate books, and damages alleging embezzlement and falsification of corporate records by the Yus. The Yukayguans also sought to establish Joseph's ownership of 200 shares nominally held by Anthony and partial dissolution

**Key Provisions/Claims:**

*   **Yukayguans' Claims:**
    *   Derivative suit alleging misappropriation of corporate funds and falsification of records by the Yus.
    *   Demand for accounting and inspection of corporate books.
    *   Claim of ownership of 200 shares of stock held by Anthony Yu as trustee for Joseph Yukayguan.
    *   After a partial settlement attempt broke down, Respondents argued that they filed a motion for dissolution that was approved by the SEC

*   **Yus' Defenses:**
    *   Denial of trusteeship and misappropriation claims.
    *   Contention that Yukayguans failed to comply with conditions precedent for filing a derivative suit, including exhaustion of remedies.
    *   Argued the complaint was intended to be a harassment

**Procedural History:**

*   **RTC:** Dismissed the complaint for failure to comply with requisites for a derivative suit and inspection of corporate books under the *Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies*. Also dismissed Yus' counterclaim.
*   **CA (Initial Decision):** Affirmed the RTC's dismissal. CA rejected the supplemental affidavit
*   **CA (Reconsideration):** *Reversed* its initial decision and remanded the case to the RTC for resolution of corporate concerns relating to Winchester, Inc.'s *dissolution* and final settlement.
*   **SC:** Reversed the CA's reconsidered decision and reinstated the original RTC dismissal, finding the CA's remand was improper.

**Legal Issues and Rulings:**

1.  **Propriety of Remand:** The SC held that the CA erred in remanding the case to the RTC to resolve corporate concerns related to the dissolution of Winchester, Inc., as this was *not* the subject matter of the original complaint (derivative suit). The CA essentially converted a derivative suit into liquidation proceedings without a proper basis. There was no evidence submitted that a dissolution petition was properly filed with or approved by the SEC.

2.  **Compliance with Derivative Suit Requirements:** The SC upheld the CA's initial ruling that the Yukayguans failed to comply with the requirements for filing a derivative suit under Section 1, Rule 8 of the *Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies*. Specifically, the complaint failed to *allege with particularity* the reasonable efforts to exhaust all available remedies within the corporation.

3.  **Admissibility of Evidence:** The SC affirmed the inadmissibility of Joseph Yukayguan's supplemental affidavit and additional evidence because it was submitted *after* the parties had agreed to submit the case for judgment on the pleadings. Rule 2 Section 8 of the Interim Rules requires that affidavits and other evidence not so submitted may be attached to the pre-trial brief. This would violate the constitutional due process

**Statutory/Case Law References:**

*   **Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies:** Specifically, Rule 2, Section 8, Rule 4 Section 4, Rule 7, Section 2, and Rule 8, Section 1
*   **Republic Act No. 8799 (Securities Regulation Code)**
*   **A.M. No. 00-11-03-SC:** Designating RTCs to handle intra-corporate disputes.
*   **Section 122 of the Corporation Code:**  Corporate liquidation.
*   **Chua v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 150793, 19 November 2004:** Regarding derivative suits.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The CA's basis for remanding the case, specifically its reliance on the alleged dissolution of Winchester, Inc. and the implied need for liquidation proceedings, lacked evidentiary support in the record. The nature and existence of the motion were not properly laid out

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   The Yukayguans face potential liability for the Yus' counterclaim, although it was dismissed by the RTC due to lack of bad faith
*   Future litigation regarding the Yus potentially draining more of the company assets

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court correctly reversed the Court of Appeals because the CA's reversal was based on improper procedure. The key deficiencies in the legal process were the failure to adequately plead for the dissolution and present any documentation that the dissolution was indeed filed.
