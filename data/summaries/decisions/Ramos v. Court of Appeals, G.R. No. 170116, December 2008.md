**Case Summary: *Atty. Carolina R. Ramos v. Court of Appeals, National Labor Relations Commission, Billex Group of Companies, et al.* G.R. No. 170116, December 23, 2008**

**Core Issue:** Legality of termination of Atty. Ramos, who claimed regular employee status following alleged illegal dismissal. The central dispute revolves around whether Atty. Ramos was a regular or probationary employee when terminated by Billex Group.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Employment Start:** Atty. Ramos was hired by Billex Group as in-house counsel on June 23, 1999. No formal employment contract was executed.
*   **Compensation:** Initially P25,000/month, increased to P50,000/month on July 1, 1999, then reverted to P25,000/month on August 2, 1999.
*   **Termination:** Terminated verbally on August 14, 1999, followed by a formal termination letter citing "business considerations."
*   **Probationary Period Dispute:** Atty. Ramos claimed a 2-week probationary period based on alleged company policy. Billex Group implied a longer period. A letter from Atty. Ramos suggesting a 5-month probationary period for another employee was cited by the NLRC.
*   **NLRC Decision:** Reversed the Labor Arbiter's ruling, finding Atty. Ramos's termination valid as a probationary employee.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Affirmed the NLRC's resolution.
*   **Procedural Issues:** Atty. Ramos filed her motion for reconsideration with the NLRC 14 days late. Her petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals was also filed late.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employer (Billex Group):** Obligation to comply with the Labor Code regarding probationary employment (Art. 281) and regular employment if the probationary employee passes regularization. Billex Group was deemed compliant in terminating Ramos.
*   **Employee (Atty. Ramos):** Obligation to meet reasonable performance standards during probation.
*   The Labor Arbiter initially found the Billex Group liable for backwages, moral and exemplary damages. However, this was reversed by the NLRC and upheld by the Court of Appeals.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of a Written Employment Contract:** This created ambiguity regarding the terms of employment, particularly the probationary period and performance standards.
*   **Subjective Standards:** The judgment mentions standards were made known to the petitioner, but this seems disputed. This poses a risk of claims of lacking due process, if the employee doesn't know what is being evaluated.
*   **"Business Considerations" for Termination:** The termination letter cited "business considerations" which, though not the sole justification, lacks the required specificity to be a just cause under Art. 281 of the Labor Code if Ramos was deemed a regular employee.
*   **Procedural Errors:** Atty. Ramos's late filings were fatal to her case, regardless of the merits.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 281:** Governs probationary employment, including duration (6 months), just cause or failure to meet reasonable standards as grounds for termination, and automatic regularization upon working beyond the probationary period.
*   **Implementing Rules of the Labor Code, Book VI, Rule I, Sec. 6:** Elaborates on probationary employment.
*   **Zapata v. NLRC (G.R. No. 77827, July 5, 1989, 175 SCRA 56):** Emphasizes the importance of timely filing a motion for reconsideration with the NLRC as a prerequisite for further remedies.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The alleged 2-week probationary period, which was unsupported by evidence, created factual dispute regarding the existence of a clear company policy in the absence of a written employment contract.
*   The letter written by Atty. Ramos acknowledging a five-month probationary period created the interpretation that she was aware of this probation period.
