**Case Summary: *Grefaldeo v. Judge Lacson*, A.M. No. MTJ-93-881 (August 3, 1998)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Judge Rica H. Lacson, Municipal Trial Court, Sorsogon, Sorsogon, for grave misconduct, dishonesty, dereliction of duty, and gross ignorance of the law.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Failure to Resolve Motion to Dismiss:** Judge Lacson failed to resolve a motion to dismiss (in Crim. Cases Nos. 10015-10033 for estafa through falsification) for over two years, despite an urgent motion. This constitutes Dereliction of Duty.
*   **False Certificates of Service:** Judge Lacson falsely certified that she had resolved all pending motions and cases within the mandatory 90-day period.  This constitutes Falsification of an Official Document.
*   **Contempt of Court:** Judge Lacson repeatedly failed to respond to multiple resolutions from the Supreme Court ordering her to comment on the allegations.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Canon 3, Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct:** Mandates prompt disposition of court business and timely resolution of cases.
*   **Constitutionally Mandated 90-Day Period:** Judges are required to resolve pending motions within 90 days.
*   **Obligation to Obey Court Orders:** All judiciary employees are bound to obey court orders and processes.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Ultimately resulted in dismissal from service.
*   **Potential Criminal Liability:** Falsification of official documents could lead to criminal charges.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Due Process:** While the Court provided multiple opportunities for response, defense counsel might argue that the severity of the penalty necessitates a more robust adversarial hearing, although Judge Lacson waived this by not responding.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** No mitigating circumstances were presented due to Judge Lacson's silence. Any existing mitigating factors were not considered.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Memorandum Circular No. 30 of the Civil Service (July 20, 1989):** Warrants dismissal for making false statements in a certificate of service.
*   **Guintu v. Lucero , A.M. No. MTJ-93-794, 23 August 1996, 261 SCRA 1, 7:** Delay in resolving motions and incidents constitutes gross inefficiency.
* Chan v. Castillo, A.M. No P-94-1055, 25 November 1994, 238 SCRA 359; Pascual v. Duncan, A. M. No. R-668-P, 23 December 1992, 216 SCRA 786 - Duty bound to obey court orders and exercise professionalism
*   **Relevant maxims:** *Qui tacet consentire videtur.* (Silence gives consent.)

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The crux of the issue revolves around Judge Lacson's deliberate and repeated refusal to address the charges, which was interpreted as an implied admission of guilt. This interpretation is based on a legal presumption, which, while valid, is heavily reliant on the judge's silence.

**Outcome:**

Judge Lacson was DISMISSED from service with forfeiture of benefits and a bar to re-employment in government service.
