## Legal Document Summary: Aguilar vs. Commission on Audit (G.R. No. 258527)

**Nature of Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court denying a Petition for Certiorari assailing a Commission on Audit (COA) decision that disallowed gratuity benefits paid by the Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) to its directors and senior officers from 2007-2010.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Disallowance:** COA disallowed PHP 90,784,975.21 in gratuity benefits paid to PNCC directors and senior officers, citing COA Circular No. 85-55-A, DBM Circular Letter No. 2002-2, and finding the disbursements excessive, unreasonable, and illegal.
*   **PNCC Status:** Core issue is whether PNCC is a Government-Owned and Controlled Corporation (GOCC). The Court affirmed its status as a GOCC without an original charter, thereby subject to GOCC regulations (citing *Strategic Alliance Dev't Corp. v. Radstock Securities Limited*).
*   **Authority:** The COA found that the PNCC Board of Directors lacked the authority to grant the gratuity benefits without prior approval from the Office of the President (OP), as required by Section 6 of PD 1597, OP Memorandum Order No. 20, Administrative Order (AO) No. 103, and DBM Circular Letter No. 2002-2. The PNCC By-Laws did not explicitly authorize the payment of such benefits.
*   **Retroactivity of *Radstock*:** Petitioners argued that *Radstock* (2009), which classified PNCC as a GOCC, should not be applied retroactively. Court held that the ruling merely confirmed PNCC's status based on existing law and did not overturn any precedent or invalidate legislation, thus applying retroactively. The doctrine of operative fact does not apply.
*   **Good Faith:** The COA rejected the argument that the officers acted in good faith. The Court found Aguilar, Defensor, and Cuejilo acted in bad faith, failing to adhere to Section 30 of the Corporation Code and breaching fiduciary duties in approving gratuity benefits despite PNCC's financial losses and lack of compliance with existing regulations.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Return of Disallowed Amounts:** Petitioners, as payees, are liable to return the disallowed amounts based on *solutio indebiti*. No exceptions to the rule of return apply.
*   **Solidary Liability:** Approving officers Aguilar, Defensor, and Cuejilo are solidarily liable for the entire disallowed amount due to bad faith and patent disregard of their duties.
*   **Procedural issue:** ND No. 11-002-(2007-2010) has already become final and executory as to Aguilar and Lusung because they failed to observe the procedure for appeal therefrom.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Assessment of Bad Faith:** The finding of bad faith against Aguilar, Defensor, and Cuejilo, Jr. is crucial as it triggers solidary liability.
*   **Application of *Madera* Rules on Return:** The court's application of *Madera* is significant, particularly regarding the standard for good faith and whether any of the recipients can demonstrate that the payments were genuinely given in consideration of services rendered or if exceptions apply. The active participation of the directors makes it harder to invoke exceptions.
*   **Financial Implications:** The individual officers and directors are now personally liable for a significant sum of money, creating a substantial financial risk.
*   **Future claims:** If the Audit Team Leader and the Supervising Auditor find, after the verification process, that the members of the BOD in fact had more participation aside from being a mere payee, a supplemental ND can be issued if warranted.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Strategic Alliance Dev't Corp. v. Radstock Securities Limited:** Establishes PNCC as a GOCC.
*   **Philippine National Construction Corp. v. Pabion and Cuenca v. Hon. Atas:** Petitioners' reliance on these cases as establishing PNCC as a private corporation rejected.
*   **Madera v. Commission on Audit:** Rules on Return
*   **PD 1597 (Section 6):** Requires GOCCs to observe presidential guidelines on compensation.
*   **Presidential Proclamation No. 50:** Creates Asset Private Trust
*   **Administrative Order (AO) No. 59:** Dissolution of government acquired-asset corporations which had not been disposed of to the private sector.
*   **OP Memorandum Order No. 20:** Suspends new or increased benefits for senior GOCC officials.
*   **AO No. 103:** Further restricts the grant of additional benefits.
*   **DBM Circular Letter No. 2002-2:** States board members are non-salaried officials and not entitled to retirement benefits.
*   **Corporation Code (Section 30):** Limits directors' compensation.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the COA's disallowance and the solidary liability of certain approving officers due to their bad faith and PNCC's status as a GOCC. The petitioners' arguments regarding good faith and the inapplicability of GOCC regulations were rejected. The Court emphasized the fiduciary duties of the board members and the need for compliance with applicable regulations.
