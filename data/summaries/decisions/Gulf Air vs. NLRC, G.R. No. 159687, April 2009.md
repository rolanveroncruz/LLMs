**Legal Document Summary: *Gulf Air v. NLRC and Reyes* G.R. No. 159687**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision that modified an NLRC decision regarding illegal dismissal.

**Key Issue:** Validity of the dismissal of Roberto J.C. Reyes (Airport Manager) for serious misconduct and breach of trust.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Dismissal:** Reyes was terminated for allegedly unauthorized acceptance of an Astro Airline ticket (no interline agreement with Gulf Air) for a passenger at the request of a Philippine Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) official, and unauthorized free hotel accommodation, violating Gulf Air policies.
*   **Company Policy:** Gulf Air alleged Reyes violated its Finance Manual (specifically section 2.16.3 regarding interline agreements) requiring authorization from the Marketing Department for accepting tickets from airlines without an interline agreement and a warning for irregularities with MATO.
*   **Employee's Defense:** Reyes claimed actions were within his public relations duties, accommodating a government official's request, and cited a prior instance of similar accommodation without reprimand. He disputed authenticity of a memo accusing him of covering the incident up.
* **NBI Report** - NBI report supported Reyes contention that the cover up Memo was not his. Gulf Air did not refute this.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employee (Reyes):** To adhere to company policies, including those regarding interline agreements and authorization for accommodations. The issue of the validity of the Memo warning Reyes on irregularities with MATO.
*   **Employer (Gulf Air):** To provide substantial evidence of willful breach of trust.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Potential Liability of Gulf Air for Illegal Dismissal:** NLRC initially ruled the dismissal illegal, awarding separation pay, backwages, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. CA affirmed the ruling of illegal dismissal but removed moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees. Ultimately, the SC determined that the appropriate penalty was suspension for 3 months.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Factual Findings:** Discrepancies between the LA and NLRC/CA's findings regarding the extent of Reyes's authority and whether a violation of company policy occurred.
*   **Ambiguity in Company Policy:** The CA and NLRC initially viewed the lack of documented policy prohibiting Reyes's actions as a weakness in Gulf Air's case, and ultimately the SC determined there was not sufficient proof of a _willful_ breach of trust, leading to Reyes avoiding termination, but instead being suspended for 3 months.
*   **Questioned Document:** The NBI report casts doubt on Gulf Air's claim of cover-up, weakening the case for willful misconduct.
* **Nature of prior warning** - There was no specific information about the MATO warning given previously.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari.
*   **Jurisprudence on Breach of Trust:** Requires willful breach for dismissal to be valid. Ordinary breach is insufficient. (e.g., *Ventura v. Court of Appeals*, *Bristol Myers Squibb v. Baban*)
*   **Labor Code:** Impliedly relevant regarding just causes for termination and procedural due process.
* **The issue of whether or not photocopied documents can be considered admissible** - it was found they could be.

**Conclusion:**

The key risk for Gulf Air was the insufficient evidence to prove that Reyes' actions constituted a *willful* breach of trust, given the conflicting evidence and the absence of clear documentation prohibiting the specific conduct. The Court ultimately ruled the dismissal was too harsh and reduced the penalty to suspension.
