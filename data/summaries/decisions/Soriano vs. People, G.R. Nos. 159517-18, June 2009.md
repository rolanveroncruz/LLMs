**Case Summary: Soriano & Ilagan v. People, BSP, PDIC (G.R. Nos. 159517-18)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petitioners Soriano (President of Rural Bank of San Miguel) and Ilagan (General Manager) appeal the CA decision affirming the RTC's denial of their motions to quash Informations for violation of Section 83 of R.A. No. 337 (DOSRI Rules) and estafa thru falsification of commercial documents.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **DOSRI Violation (R.A. 337, Sec. 83):** Soriano allegedly indirectly obtained loans from RBSM using the names of Malang and Mañaol without proper board approval, thereby violating DOSRI rules. The crucial elements are obtaining a loan indirectly, lack of written board approval excluding the interested director, failure to record the approval, and failure to transmit a copy to BSP.
*   **Estafa thru Falsification of Commercial Documents (RPC Art. 315, 1(b) & 2(a)):** Soriano and Ilagan allegedly falsified loan documents to make it appear Malang and Mañaol obtained loans and converted the proceeds for their benefit, damaging RBSM, its creditors, BSP and PDIC. The elements of Estafa 315 1(b) are (i) property is received in trust, (ii) misappropriation or conversion of such money or property by the offender, or denial on his part of such receipt; (iii) that such misappropriation or conversion or denial is to the prejudice of another; and (iv) that there is demand made by the offended party to the offender.The elements of Estafa 315 2(a) are  (i) that there must be a false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means; (ii) that such false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means must be made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud; (iii) that the offended party must have relied on the false pretense, fraudulent act, or fraudulent means--that is, he was induced to part with his money or property because of the false pretense, fraudulent act, or fraudulent means; and (iv) that, as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage.

**Petitioners' Arguments:**

1.  **Duplicity of Offenses:** Soriano argues that charging him with both DOSRI violation and estafa arising from the same act is duplicitous. This argument is rejected because each Information only charges one offense.
2.  **Facts Don't Constitute an Offense:** Petitioners claim the Informations are insufficient. The court finds that the Informations sufficiently allege the elements of both DOSRI violation and estafa, even if based on a single act.

**Court's Reasoning and Ruling:**

*   **No Duplicity:** The court holds that multiple informations, each charging a distinct offense, do not constitute duplicity. Duplicity refers to a single information charging multiple offenses.
*   **Single Act, Multiple Offenses:** A single act can violate multiple laws, resulting in separate charges. The DOSRI violation requires proof of elements different from estafa (e.g., lack of board approval vs. deceit). Cites *Loney v. People* for precedent.
*   **Sufficiency of Allegations:** The Informations adequately allege the elements of both crimes. Defenses against these allegations are matters for trial.

**Potential Risks and Concerns:**

*   **Conviction on Both Counts:** Petitioners face the risk of being convicted and sentenced for both the DOSRI violation and estafa.
*   **Evidentiary Burden:** Petitioners bear the burden of proving their defenses at trial.
*   **Prejudicial Publicity:** High-profile nature of banking fraud could create prejudicial publicity.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Loney v. People:** Affirms the principle that a single act can constitute multiple offenses if each offense requires proof of a distinct element not required by the other.
*   **People v. Doriquez:** Defines "same offense" for double jeopardy purposes as requiring identical elements of proof.
*   *Torres v. Abundo, Sr*: Defines Grave abuse of discretion.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 337, Sec. 83 (General Banking Act as amended):** Defines the DOSRI rules and penalties for violations.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 315 (Estafa):** Defines the elements of estafa, including estafa thru falsification of commercial documents.
*   **1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure, Rule 117, Sec. 3(e):** addresses motion to quash based on duplicity of offences.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contention revolves around whether the "same act" doctrine should preclude multiple prosecutions arising from a single factual incident. The court resolves this against the petitioners, relying on *Loney v. People* and the differing elements required for DOSRI violation and estafa.

**Conclusion:** The Court denied the Petition for Review, affirming the CA decision. The case will proceed to trial on the merits. The defense should focus on disproving the elements of both offenses, particularly the intent to defraud in the estafa charges and demonstrating compliance with banking regulations, if any.
