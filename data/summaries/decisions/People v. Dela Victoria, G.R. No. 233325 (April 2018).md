## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Dela Victoria*

**Case Citation:** 829 Phil. 675 (G.R. No. 233325, April 16, 2018)

**Subject:** Appeal of conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court REVERSED the Court of Appeals' decision and ACQUITTED Dela Victoria due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and failure to adhere to Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, compromising the integrity of the evidence.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II of RA 9165:** Defines and penalizes the illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):** Outlines the mandatory procedure for handling seized drugs to preserve integrity and evidentiary value, including immediate inventory and photography of the seized items in the presence of the accused, representatives from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and an elected public official. This must occur immediately after seizure and confiscation. Seized items must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within 24 hours.
*   **Prosecution Obligation:** To prove beyond reasonable doubt (1) the identity of buyer, seller, object (drugs), and consideration (payment); and (2) the delivery of the drugs and the payment. This includes establishing an unbroken chain of custody.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Accused:** Potential liability of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000 for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165.
*   **Law Enforcement:** Risk of jeopardizing prosecution due to non-compliance with chain of custody requirements, potentially leading to acquittal.
*   **Prosecution:** Failure to prove each element of the crime and justify deviations from Section 21 could lead to acquittal.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Defines the crime and establishes procedures for handling evidence.
*   **RA 10640:** Amended Section 21 of RA 9165, which provides that noncompliance of requirements under justifiable grounds will not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team
*   **People v. Mendoza:** Emphasizes the need for media, DOJ, and elected public official representatives to ensure the integrity of the seizure and marking process.
*   **People v. Almorfe:** Requires the prosecution to explain the reasons behind procedural lapses and demonstrate the preservation of the evidence's integrity for the "saving clause" to apply.
*   **People v. De Guzman:** Emphasizes that justifiable grounds for non-compliance must be proven as fact.
*   **People v. Dahil:** Highlights the importance of immediate marking of seized drugs and the difference between marking and inventory-taking.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Justifiable Grounds" Exception:** While RA 10640 and IRR allow for deviations from strict compliance with Section 21 under "justifiable grounds," the prosecution failed to adequately demonstrate such grounds in this case. The court found the explanation for not immediately marking the drugs at the crime scene or nearest police station insufficient.
*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** The marking and inventory were conducted at the PDEA office instead of at the scene of the arrest or nearest police station or the presence of the accused. No DOJ representative was present. These deviations raised significant doubts about the integrity of the evidence.

**Potential Issues for Trial:**

*   Whether the "justifiable grounds" exception to strict compliance with Section 21 was validly invoked. The prosecution must prove the reasons for the non-compliance.
*   Whether the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs were properly preserved, despite the procedural lapses. The defense can challenge the chain of custody and raise doubts about the authenticity of the evidence.
*   Whether the proximity of Langihan Police Station and the San Ignacio Barangay Hall to the place of arrest could have been a better alternative in compliance to Section 21.
