## Legal Document Summary: LBP vs. Belista (G.R. No. 164631)

This case concerns a dispute over the just compensation for land expropriated under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) and presents a jurisdictional question regarding the proper venue for challenging the DARAB Adjudicator's land valuation.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Land Acquisition:** Spouses Ralla donated agricultural lands to Belista which were subsequently placed under CARP.
*   **Valuation Dispute:** Disagreement arose between DAR/LBP valuation (around P300k) and Belista's claim.
*   **RARAD Decision:** The Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (RARAD) initially fixed just compensation at P2,896,408.91, later modified to P2,540,211.58.
*   **LBP's RTC Petition:** LBP directly filed a Petition for Determination of Just Compensation with the RTC (sitting as a Special Agrarian Court, SAC), bypassing an appeal to the DARAB.
*   **RTC Dismissal:** The RTC dismissed the petition, citing failure to exhaust administrative remedies under Sections 5, 6, and 7, Rule XIX of the 2003 DARAB Rules of Procedure.
*   **CA Affirmed Dismissal:** The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC's dismissal.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) **reversed** the CA and RTC decisions, holding that the RTC, sitting as a SAC, has original and exclusive jurisdiction over petitions for the determination of just compensation. The case was remanded to the RTC for hearing.

**Key Legal Issues & Case Law:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The primary issue is whether LBP was required to appeal the RARAD's decision to the DARAB *before* filing an original action in the RTC-SAC.
*   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** The lower courts held that LBP failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not appealing to the DARAB.
*   **1994 vs. 2003 DARAB Rules:** The 1994 DARAB Rules in effect when the case was filed allowed for direct appeal to the RTC sitting as the SAC. While the 2003 Rules mandated appeal to DARAB.
*   **R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):**
    *   **Section 50:** Grants DAR primary jurisdiction over agrarian reform matters.
    *   **Section 57:** Grants the SAC *original and exclusive* jurisdiction over petitions for determination of just compensation.
*   **Republic v. CA (G.R. No. 122256):** Reaffirms SAC's original and exclusive jurisdiction over just compensation.
*   **LBP v. Wycoco (G.R. Nos. 140160 & 146733):** Upheld RTC's jurisdiction even without DARAB summary administrative proceedings.
*   **LBP v. Natividad (G.R. No. 127198):**  Primary jurisdiction of DAR for preliminary determination, but subject to judicial challenge.
*   **LBP v. Celada (G.R. No. 164876):**  Eminent domain valuation is a judicial function, not for administrative agencies.

**SC's Rationale:**

*   **Section 57 RA 6657 prevails:** The SC emphasized that Section 57 of RA No. 6657 grants the RTC-SAC original and exclusive jurisdiction over just compensation cases.  This cannot be undermined by administrative rules.
*   **Rules of Procedure vs. Statute:** Rules of procedure cannot confer or restrict jurisdiction which is solely determined by statute. While Section 5, Rule XIX of the 2003 DARAB Rules of Procedure provides that the land valuation cases decided by the adjudicator are now appealable to the Board, such rule could not change the clear import of Section 57 of RA No. 6657.
*   **Judicial Function:** Determining just compensation is inherently a judicial function related to eminent domain.
*   **Direct resort to SAC is valid:** Because the law specifies that SAC has jurisdiction over the matter.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **DARAB's Role:** The decision doesn't eliminate DARAB's role altogether, as it retains primary jurisdiction to *preliminarily* determine just compensation through administrative proceedings. However, this determination is always subject to judicial review by the SAC.
*   **"Primary Jurisdiction" Ambiguity:** The exact scope of DARAB's "primary jurisdiction" may be subject to further litigation. The question of when the "primary jurisdiction" ends and judicial intervention is permissible remains.
*   **Retroactive Application of Rules:** This case highlights the potential for confusion when new administrative rules are implemented and their impact on pending cases.

**Implications:**

*   This case confirms that landowners dissatisfied with DARAB's valuation of their land can directly file a petition for determination of just compensation with the RTC-SAC.
*   It clarifies the limited extent to which administrative agencies can dictate procedure where original jurisdiction lies with the courts.
*   It reinforces the judicial nature of determining just compensation in eminent domain cases.
