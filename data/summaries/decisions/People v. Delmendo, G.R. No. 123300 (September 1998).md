## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Delmendo*, G.R. No. 123300 (1998)

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Elpidio Delmendo y Urpiano*

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for Murder (Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code)

**Key Facts:** The accused-appellant, Elpidio Delmendo, was convicted of murdering Atty. Elpidio Monteclaro. The prosecution presented two eyewitnesses who positively identified Delmendo as the shooter. The defense presented alibi witnesses, whose testimonies were deemed inconsistent and unreliable. The accused did not testify.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for murder but modified the award of damages.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Conviction for Murder:** Affirmed based on positive identification by credible witnesses.
*   **Treachery:** Present, qualifying the killing to murder, as the attack was sudden and unexpected, depriving the victim of any chance to defend himself. Cites *People v. Abrenica, G.R. No. 118771, January 18, 1996, 252 SCRA 54; People vs. Canuzo, G.R. No. 112718, March 29, 1996, 255 SCRA 497; People vs. Cortez, et al., G,R. No. 120920, February 12, 1998*.
*   **Civil Indemnity:** Reduced to P50,000.00, aligning with prevailing jurisprudence. Cites *People vs. Sol, G.R. No. 1 18504, May 7, 1997, 272 SCRA 392.*
*   **Loss of Earning Capacity:** Upheld award of P2,500,000.00, calculated based on victim's age (55), annual income (P255,000.00), and reasonable living expenses (P100,000.00), applying the formula outlined in *Villa Rey Transit, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. No. L-25499, February 18, 1970, 31 SCRA 511; see also People vs. Teehankee, Jr., G.R. Nos. 111206-08, October 6, 1995, 249 SCRA 54.*

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Guilt beyond reasonable doubt for murder, resulting in a sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   P50,000.00 civil indemnity.
    *   P2,500,000.00 for loss of earning capacity.
    *   P80,000.00 for funeral expenses.
    *   Costs of the suit.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** Reliance on eyewitness testimony despite defense efforts to introduce conflicting accounts. The court gives significant weight to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, citing cases such as *People vs. Victor, G.R. No. 127903, July 9, 1998*.
*   **Defense Weakness:** The Court notes the weakness of the defense’s denial and alibi, especially in light of positive identification.  The unexplained failure of the accused to testify was noted by the court.
*   **Moral Damages:** Denial of moral damages due to lack of evidence presented by the prosecution, distinguishing it from cases involving heinous crimes against chastity (e.g. *People v. Prades, G.R. No. 127569, July 30, 1998*).
*   **Flight as Evidence of Guilt:** The Court used Delmendo's use of a false name and attempts to evade authorities.
* The court noted that the qualifying circumstance of treachery was properly applied in the original lower court case.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** None specifically noted. The dispute revolves around the factual determination of identity and the credibility of witnesses. The lack of moral damages may be contentious if further evidence could have been presented on the matter.

**Overall Assessment:** The conviction is strongly supported by eyewitness testimony and the accused's conduct after the crime. The appeal primarily argues against the factual findings of the trial court, which are generally accorded great weight.
