## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Terrado*, G.R. No. 148226

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Certiorari filed by the People and Spouses Garcia challenging the acquittal of Joseph Terrado by the RTC for Carnapping under R.A. 6538 (Anti-Carnapping Act of 1972). The RTC found that the prosecution failed to prove "intent to gain" which is necessary for a carnapping conviction, ordering accused only to pay for the actual and moral damages suffered by the private complainant.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **R.A. 6538 (Anti-Carnapping Act of 1972):**  The core statute under which the accused was charged. The prosecution bears the burden of proving all elements of carnapping beyond reasonable doubt, including intent to gain.
*   **Civil Liability:** Even though Terrado was acquitted of carnapping, the RTC ordered him to pay actual and moral damages to the complainant.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Double Jeopardy:** The Supreme Court highlights that a petition for certiorari seeking to overturn an acquittal is problematic because it could violate the constitutional right against double jeopardy. Any review of the RTC's findings by the SC would essentially be an appeal, which is prohibited for acquittals.
*   **Lack of Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The SC finds that the trial court's acquittal, even if based on arguably incorrect factual findings, does not constitute grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.  The alleged errors are characterized as errors of judgment (correctable via Rule 45), not errors of jurisdiction (addressable by certiorari).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6538:**  Anti-Carnapping Act of 1972
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Special Civil Action for Certiorari â€“ the remedy sought by the petitioner, but found inappropriate by the SC.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Petition for Review on Certiorari - remedy for errors of judgement.
*   **Case law cited defining Grave Abuse of Discretion**: Cases like *People v. Court of Appeals, United Coconut Planters Bank v. Looyuko* are cited to define the scope of the remedy of certiorari, and the prohibition of converting it into an appeal.
*   **Case law regarding double jeopardy**: the ruling that the court cannot rule any other way other than to afford the accused protection against repeated attempts for conviction, in faithful adherence to the constitutional rule against double jeopardy.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Intent to Gain:**  The key issue is whether the RTC correctly assessed the evidence regarding the element of "intent to gain," which is a crucial component of the crime of carnapping.
*   **Propriety of Certiorari:** The central legal issue is whether the petition for certiorari is the proper remedy to challenge the RTC's decision, considering the acquittal of the accused and the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.
*   **Factual Findings:** The dispute over the facts, as the petitioners allege there was misapprehension of facts, is not appropriately within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court for a certiorari proceeding.
*   **Participation of the OSG**: While not stated explicitly, it is alluded to that the private prosecutor filed the petition for certiorari without the participation of the Office of the Solicitor General. This would raise issues of standing and whether a private party can prosecute on behalf of the People of the Philippines.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition for certiorari, primarily because it deemed that the RTC's decision, even if erroneous in its factual findings, did not constitute grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction, and that considering the acquittal, a review would violate the double jeopardy clause. The court suggested that the proper remedy would have been a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45, but that avenue is no longer viable due to the acquittal.
