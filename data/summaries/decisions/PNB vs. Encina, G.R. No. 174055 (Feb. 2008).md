**Case:** *Philippine National Bank vs. Spouses Wilfredo and Estela Encina*, G.R. No. 174055, February 12, 2008 (568 Phil. 552)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court reviewed a Court of Appeals decision that declared null and void the interest rate imposed by PNB and the subsequent extrajudicial foreclosure of the Encina spouses' properties. The Encina spouses obtained several loans from PNB, secured by real estate mortgages. PNB foreclosed on the properties after the Encina spouses defaulted. The spouses then filed suit to nullify the foreclosure. The RTC dismissed the complaint, but the CA reversed. The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and remanded the case to the RTC to resolve the first cause of action regarding the agricultural loan.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Loan Agreements & Security:** The Encinas secured multiple loans from PNB with real estate mortgages on their properties.
*   **Interest Rate Provision:**  The promissory notes contained a provision that the interest rate "will be set by the Management" of PNB. This was the core of the dispute.
*   **Extrajudicial Foreclosure:** PNB extrajudicially foreclosed on the properties due to the Encina spouses' default.
*   **First Cause of Action (Agricultural Loan):** Encinas argued their loan was an agricultural loan with a long gestation period, entitling them to restructuring and exemption from penalties under Central Bank Circulars and the Agricultural Modernization Act of 1997.
*   **Second Cause of Action (Usury Law):** Encinas alleged violation of the Usury Law.
*   **Third Cause of Action (Procedural Defects in Foreclosure):** Encinas claimed failure to comply with the notice requirements of Act No. 3135.
*   **Mutuality of Contracts:** A key point raised by the CA was the lack of a definite agreement on the interest rate, arguing it violated the principle of mutuality of contracts.
*   **Motion to Dismiss:** The RTC initially dismissed the complaint on PNB's motion. The Supreme Court notes that in ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, the court must hypothetically admit the truth of the allegations in the complaint.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Encina Spouses:** Obligated to repay the principal loan amount. Liability for legal interest on the loan from the date it was granted until full payment.
*   **PNB:** Obligated to comply with the terms of the loan agreements and the requirements of extrajudicial foreclosure under Act No. 3135.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Interest Rate Set by Management" Clause:** The most contentious clause. The CA found it violated the principle of mutuality of contracts because it allowed PNB to unilaterally determine the interest rate. This could render the interest rate provision unenforceable.
*   **Ambiguity of Loan Purpose:** The disagreement over whether the loan was for agricultural purposes or metal craft business creates uncertainty and impacts the applicable regulations (e.g., the Agricultural Modernization Act of 1997).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 2655 (Usury Law):** While the Encinas alleged a violation, the Supreme Court noted that Central Bank Circular No. 905 removed the ceiling on interest rates, effectively rendering the Usury Law legally ineffective.  *Tan v. Court of Appeals, 356 Phil. 1058 (1998)*.
*   **Act No. 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure):** The Encinas alleged failure to comply with the notice requirements, specifically Section 3 regarding posting and publication.
*   **Agricultural Modernization Act of 1997:** The Encinas' first cause of action relied on this law. The law affects the loan, and the length of the term.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1159:** Obligation arising from contracts have the force of law.
*   ***Balo v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 129704, 30 September 2005, 471 SCRA 227, 236-237** - The principle of motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action.

**Analysis for Litigation:**

*   **PNB's Strongest Argument:** Central Bank Circular No. 905 removed interest rate ceilings, rendering the Usury Law claim moot. The Encinas also leased the property from PNB post-foreclosure which creates a strong argument of implied acknowledgement.
*   **Encina's Strongest Argument:** The "interest rate set by management" clause could be challenged as violating mutuality of contracts, but is only available if there is no other stipulations or the interest rate is not considered as set by the market. Also the status of the loan as an agricultural loan has the potential to grant Encinas a favorable restructuring of payment.
*   **Remand Focus:**  The case is remanded to the RTC to determine if the loan was indeed for agricultural purposes, and the consequences thereof.
*   **Strategic Considerations:** Thorough discovery is needed to establish the purpose of the loan and the details of PNB's interest rate setting process.
