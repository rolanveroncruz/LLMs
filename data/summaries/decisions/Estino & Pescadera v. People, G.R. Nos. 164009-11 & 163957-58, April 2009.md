*   **Respondent:** People of the Philippines

**Key Provisions & Charges:**

*   **Criminal Case No. 26192 (G.R. Nos. 163957-58):** Violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 for causing undue injury to provincial government employees by failing to pay salary differentials, ACA, PERA, RATA, mid-year bonus, cash gift, and clothing allowance.

*   **Criminal Case No. 26194:** Acquittal for both accused due to the prosecution's failure to prove damage or injury. This case involves alleged irregularities in the cash withdrawal.

**Sandiganbayan Ruling:**

*   **Criminal Case No. 26192:** Estino and Pescadera found guilty of violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019 for failing to pay **RATA**. Sentence: Imprisonment (6 years 1 month to 15 years) and perpetual disqualification from public office.

Sentence for Pescadera: Imprisonment (12 years, 5 months, 11 days to 20 years), perpetual special disqualification, fine, accessory penalties, restitution of Php 4,820,365.30, and cost of suit.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **G.R. Nos. 163957-58 (RA 3019):** *Sandiganbayan Decision set aside, and case remanded for a new trial.*  The Court found that the petitioners were prevented from presenting exculpatory evidence regarding RATA payment under the 1998 reenacted budget. The new evidence was disbursement vouchers and sworn statement of the provincial staff. The fact that the trial judge was not the one who rendered the sentence.
*   **G.R. Nos. 164009-11 (Malversation):** *Sandiganbayan Decision reversed, and Pescadera acquitted.* The prosecution failed to prove that Pescadera used the GSIS contributions for his personal benefit. Court emphasizes a demand is a requisite for the application of the presumption.

**Key Issues & Arguments:**

*   **RA 3019 Charge:** Whether petitioners failed to pay RATA, thus violating Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019.
    *   **Petitioners' argument:** RATA was paid under the 1998 reenacted budget. The audit reports focused on the 1999 budget and may have misled the Court, making the production of evidence unnecessary.
    *   **Respondent's argument:** The term "RATA" falls under "benefits" in the COA report. The new evidence is belated and unsubstantiated. The payment of RATA was made *after* the convictions of the petitioners.
*   **Malversation Charge:** Whether Pescadera is guilty of malversation of public funds for failure to remit GSIS contributions.
    *   **Pescadera's argument:** The elements of malversation were not met because there was no official demand for accounting. The failure to remit was due to the prioritization of other obligations and lack of funds.
    *   **Respondent's argument:** Pescadera misappropriated the GSIS premiums because there was no valid defense against the charges.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **New Trial (RA 3019):** The remand for a new trial opens the door to the potential for the prosecution to strengthen its case. The authenticity of the vouchers will be disputed.
*   **Demand (Malversation):** The finding that there was no formal demand on Pescadera, thus negating the presumption of malversation, creates a stricter interpretation of the requirement for demand in such cases. It also places the burden on the prosecution to prove malversation by direct evidence.
*   **Conspiracy:** There is ambiguity regarding the role of Estino in the malversation charge, as the Sandiganbayan acknowledged Pescadera's failure to inform Estino of the remittance requirements. This raises the issue of whether Estino should have known and taken corrective action, potentially leading to a reversal had there been a demand.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Section 3(e):** Prohibits causing undue injury or giving unwarranted benefits through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 217:** Defines and penalizes malversation of public funds. Includes presumption of malversation upon failure to account for funds after demand.
*   **RA 8291 (Government Service Insurance System Act of 1997), Section 6(b):** Mandates remittance of GSIS contributions within the first 10 days of the month and prioritizes remittance over other obligations (except salaries and wages).
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1445:** Prohibits payment in cash instead of through checks.
*   **Local Government Code, Section 344:** Requirements of accountant signing disbursement vouchers.
*   **Government Accounting and Auditing Manual, Secs. 157 and 168:** Government accounting rules.
*   **Sabiniano v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 76490, October 6, 1995):** Cited by the Sandiganbayan to show that mere signature/approval is not enough to sustain a finding of conspiracy.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Sandiganbayan's conviction of Pescadera for malversation and ordered a new trial for Estino and Pescadera on the RA 3019 charge. The case highlights the importance of a clear record and specific demands in malversation cases. It also demonstrates the Court's willingness to relax procedural rules in certain circumstances, particularly where the accused may have been misled during trial. The new trial raises the risk of further legal battles and potential for conviction if the prosecution can rebut the new evidence presented by the defense.
