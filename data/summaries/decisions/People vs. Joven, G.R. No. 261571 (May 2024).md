## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Joven* (G.R. No. 261571)

**Case Overview:** This is an appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Paul Joven for sexual offenses against AAA, a minor. The RTC convicted Joven of two counts of other sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of Republic Act (RA) No. 7610. The CA modified the conviction to two counts of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1, in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended, and the Supreme Court affirmed.

**Key Provisions & Legal Framework:**

*   **RA 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act):** Section 5(b) concerns child prostitution and other sexual abuse. The SC clarifies that for a conviction under this section, the child must be exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse, implying the child willingly indulged into sexual intercourse due to money, profit or any other consideration or coercion and influence of any adult, syndicate or group.
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by RA 8353 (Anti-Rape Law of 1997):** Article 266-A defines rape and Article 266-B prescribes penalties. Relevant is carnal knowledge through force, threat, or intimidation.
*   **RA 11648:** Raises the age of sexual consent to 16, not applicable retroactively to this case.
*   **Rules on Child Abuse Cases, Section 2(g):** Defines sexual abuse.

**Factual Background:**

*   AAA, 17 years old at the time, was persuaded by Joven to meet him.
*   Joven forcibly had sexual intercourse with AAA on two occasions, despite her lack of consent.
*   Originally, Joven was charged with violation of Sec 5(b) of RA 7610.

**Core Legal Issue:** Whether Joven's actions constitute "other sexual abuse" under RA 7610 or rape under the RPC.

**Court's Reasoning:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's reclassification of the crime to rape under the RPC.
*   The SC stated that the victim must give consent in order for the crime to be categorized under RA 7610. 
*   The SC held that the facts alleged in the Informations and proven by the prosecution established that Joven committed rape as defined in Article 266-A, paragraph 1 in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC.
*   The victim did not agree to have sexual intercourse with Joven, and the SC emphasized the lack of consent, a key element differentiating rape from other sexual abuse.
*   It relied on *People v. Tulagan* (849 Phil. 197 (2019)) clarifying that the Anti-Rape law will be applied to perpetrators of the sexual intercourse if there is force, threat, or intimidation used when the victim has not given consent. This case prevails over Section 5(b) of RA No. 7610.
*   The court rejected Joven's alibi and denial, citing his admitted familiarity with the area and the victim.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Joven is liable for two counts of rape under the RPC, as amended.
*   Joven must serve a sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for each count.
*   Joven must pay AAA P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of rape.
*   All amounts awarded will accrue interest at 6% per annum from the date of finality of the decision.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Incorrect Designation in Information:** While the initial charge cited RA 7610, the SC held that the factual allegations in the Information were controlling, allowing for conviction under the RPC. *People v. Mendoza* (256 Phil. 1136 (1989)). The terms "coercion and undue influence" used in the Informations were sufficient to apprise accused-appellant of the nature and cause of the accusation charged against him. In Quimvel v. People (808 Phil. 889 (2017)), the Court has clarified that the term "force and intimidation" is subsumed under "coercion and influence".
*   **Credibility of Testimony:** Joven challenged the credibility of AAA's testimony. However, the SC deferred to the lower courts' assessment of her credibility, stating that the inability to provide specific details is understandable given the trauma of rape. Citing *People v. Brioso* (788 Phil. 292, 310 (2016)).
*   **Defense of Alibi:** Alibi is a weak defense in light of Joven's admitted familiarity with the victim and the area.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Tulagan, 849 Phil. 197 (2019):** Key case distinguishing rape under the RPC from sexual abuse under RA 7610 based on the presence of force, threat, or intimidation versus the victim's exploitation in prostitution or sexual abuse. This case is heavily relied upon by the Supreme Court.
*   **People v. Abay, 599 Phil. 390 (2009); People v. Pangilinan, 676 Phil. 16 (2011); People v. Tubillo, 811 Phil. 525 (2017):** These are referred to by the Court as cases clarified by *People v. Tulagan*.
*   **People v. Quintos, 746 Phil. 809 (2014):** Rape is a violation of dignity and based on consent
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 805 (2016):** Sets standard amounts for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in cases warranting *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **People v. Larin, 357 Phil. 987 (1998):** Discusses the term "deemed exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse."
*   **Quimvel v. People, 808 Phil. 889 (2017):** Clarified the term "force and intimidation"
*   **Matilde, Jr. v. Jabson, 160-A Phil. 1098 (1975):** Lays down the test to determine the sufficiency of an Information
*   **People v. Mendoza, 256 Phil. 1136 (1989):** Clarifies that it is the recital of facts that determine the character of the crime
*   **People v. Saludo, 662 Phil. 738 (2011):** A rape victim cannot be expected to mechanically keep and give an accurate account of the traumatic and horrifying experience she had undergone.
*   **People v. Dubria, 395 Phil. 325 (2000):** Discusses the requirements when the defense of alibi may be appreciated.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** The primary ambiguity surrounded the application of RA 7610 versus the RPC. The Court clarified that the nature of the victimâ€™s consent (or lack thereof) is the determining factor.

**Conclusion:** The SC affirmed the CA's conviction of Joven for two counts of rape, emphasizing the lack of consent and the application of force. The case highlights the importance of distinguishing between sexual abuse under RA 7610 and rape under the RPC.
