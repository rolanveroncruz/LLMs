**Case:** *Leviste Management System, Inc. vs. Legaspi Towers 200, Inc.* G.R. No. 199353 & 199389, April 4, 2018.

**Subject Matter:** Dispute over illegal construction ("Concession 4") on top of a condominium unit within Legaspi Towers, specifically concerning the applicability of Article 448 of the Civil Code (builder in good faith) and the Condominium Act (RA 4726).

**Key Holding:** Article 448 of the Civil Code on builders in good faith is *inapplicable* in cases governed by the Condominium Act. The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and ordered LEMANS to remove the illegal construction at its own expense.

**Factual Background:**

*   LEMANS, owner of Concession 3, constructed Concession 4 on the roof deck of Concession 3, which is the air space of the entire condominium building.
*   Legaspi Towers objected, arguing the construction violated the Master Deed, By-Laws, and the Condominium Act.
*   LEMANS secured a building permit (validity questioned).
*   Lower courts initially applied Article 448 of the Civil Code, finding both parties in good faith, and ordering Legaspi Towers to choose between appropriating the construction with indemnity or requiring LEMANS to lease the airspace.

**Key Provisions/Issues/Obligations:**

*   **Condominium Act (RA 4726), Section 4:** Requires an enabling or master deed specifying the number of stories and basements of the building. Amendment or revocation requires consent of all registered owners and lienholders.
*   **Master Deed with Declaration of Restrictions of Legaspi Towers:** Specifies the building consists of seven storeys with two levels above the deck roof. Construction of Concession 4 violates this.
*   **By-Laws of Legaspi Towers:** Requires approval by members for extraordinary improvements or additions, and provides a process for abating violations of the Master Deed.
*   **Civil Code, Article 448:** Pertains to the rights and obligations of a landowner and a builder in good faith.
*   **Civil Code, Article 699:** Concerns remedies against a public nuisance (argued by Legaspi Towers).
*   **LEMANS' Obligation:** To adhere to the Condominium Act, Master Deed, and By-Laws.  Failed to obtain proper consent for the construction.
*   **Legaspi Towers' Right:** Right to enforce the Master Deed and By-Laws, including the right to abate violations such as the illegal construction.

**Reasoning/Legal Analysis:**

*   **Inapplicability of Article 448:**  The Court held that Article 448 does not apply where a contractual relation exists (i.e., the Master Deed and By-Laws).  Furthermore, the builder (LEMANS) and the landowner (Legaspi Towers) are not distinct entities in the same way Article 448 envisions. LEMANS, as a unit owner, is also a member/stockholder of the condominium corporation, and their relationship is governed by the Condominium Act, a *special law* that prevails over the general provisions of the Civil Code.
*   **Violation of the Condominium Act:** LEMANS failed to comply with Section 4 of the Condominium Act by not securing consent from all registered owners for the amendment of the Master Deed.
*   **Violation of By-Laws:** LEMANS failed to obtain approval from the members of the condominium corporation for the construction of Concession 4, violating the By-Laws.
*   **Right to Abatement:** Legaspi Towers, according to the Master Deed, the By-Laws, and the Condominium Act, has the right to demolish Concession 4 at the expense of LEMANS, since it is an illegal construction.
*   **Internal Arrangement with President:** The internal arrangement between LEMANS and the then president of Legaspi Towers cannot bind the Corporation as it acts through its Board of Directors.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 4726 (Condominium Act)
*   Civil Code, Articles 448, 546, 699
*   Corporation Code, Section 23

**Case Law References:**

*   *Depra v. Dumlao*, 221 Phil. 168 (1985) -  Distinguished; the court emphasizes that this case doesn't concern the application of this ruling.
*   *Crispino v. Tansay*, G.R. No. 184466, December 5, 2016 - Clarifies that the Court is not bound by the interlocutory orders of the trial court nor by the Court of Appeals' Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 73621
*   *Communities Cagayan, Inc. v. Nanol, *698 Phil. 648 (2012)* - General Rule of Article 448 not applying where contractual relation between the parties exists
*   *Tuatis v. Escol, *619 Phil. 465 (2009)* - The choice under Article 448 belongs to the owner of the land is in accord with the principle of accession, i.e., that the accessory follows the principal and not the other way around

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation Disputes:** While the court addressed the legal issue of liability, valuation arguments could arise during the execution phase regarding the cost of removal of Concession 4.
*   **Enforcement Challenges:** Potential challenges in physically removing the structure. LEMANS might raise further arguments delaying the demolition process.
*   **Future Disputes:** This case sets a precedent for future construction disputes within condominiums.  It clarifies the primacy of the Condominium Act and internal regulations over general Civil Code provisions.

**Conclusion:**

This case decisively establishes the supremacy of the Condominium Act and related condominium documents in governing construction and modification issues within condominium projects. It significantly limits the application of Article 448 of the Civil Code in such contexts, particularly when the construction violates the Master Deed and By-Laws, and the Condominium Act is recorded. The key takeaway is that unit owners cannot unilaterally alter or add to common areas without proper consent and compliance with applicable regulations, and the condominium corporation has the right to enforce these restrictions.
