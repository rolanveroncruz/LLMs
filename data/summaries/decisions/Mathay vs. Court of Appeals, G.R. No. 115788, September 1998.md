## Legal Document Summary: *Sps. Sonya & Ismael Mathay, Jr. v. CA, et al.*, G.R. No. 115788

**Type:** Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45)

**Issue:** Dispute over ownership of Lot 2186 of the Sta. Cruz de Malabon Estate in Tanza, Cavite. Competing claims based on different Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs). Central question is the validity and priority of the petitioners' (Mathays') title (TCT No. T-113047) versus the respondents' (Atangan, Poblete, Tirona, et al.) titles.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed the petition, affirming the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision which favored the respondents. The Mathays' title was declared invalid, and they were ordered to vacate the property.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Respondents' Claims:** Derived titles ultimately from TCT No. T-85866 (Heirs of Batallones and Quimio, 1976), originating from a compromise agreement in Civil Case No. NC-709 (Lucido vs. Batallones and Quimio) and traceable to a Deed of Conveyance from the Bureau of Lands. They allege continuous possession and payment of taxes.
*   **Petitioners' (Mathays') Claim:** Based on TCT No. T-113047 (1980), derived from TCT No. T-111070 in the names of Pedro Banayo and Pablo Pugay. The Mathays argue they were buyers in good faith relying on the face of the title.
*   **Petitioners' Arguments on Appeal:**
    *   Good faith purchase based on a clean title (TCT No. T-111070). Reliance on *Dino v. CA* regarding the burden of proving forgery.
    *   Earlier title (1980) prevails over later titles (1986-88) under Article 1544 of the Civil Code (double sale).
    *   Deed of Sale executed by vendors (Banayo & Pugay) is duly notarized.
*   **Court's Reasoning (SC & CA):**
    *   **Lack of Good Faith (Mathays):** The Mathays' predecessors-in-interest (Banayo and Pugay) never possessed the land. The presence of occupants (respondents) should have prompted further inquiry. *Ocular inspection is standard practice in Real Estate, thus expected.* Failed to exercise due diligence. *Mathays ignored warnings and fenced with armed personnel*
    *   **Invalidity of Banayo & Pugay's Title:** The title (TCT No. T-111070) was found to be based on forged documents.
        *   The alleged Assignment of Sale Certificate No. 3397 from Tomas Lucido was not signed by him. Lucido testified he did not know Banayo and Pugay and sold the land to the Atangans (Respondents).
        *   Deed No. V-12918 and Sales Certificate No. 2454 (basis for Banayo and Pugay's title) were also deemed forged, *Former director Casanova's Signature was forged according to Mr. Freiras (Bureau of Lands)*, with conflicting information: different lot number than the deed of conveyance.
    *   **Priority of Title:** Since Mathays derive their claim from a forged document, no question of double sale under Art. 1544 arises.
    *   **"Spring Cannot Rise Higher Than Its Source" (Calalang v. Register of Deeds):** A defective original title cannot be the basis for valid subsequent titles.
    *   **Nemo potest plus juris ad alium transferre quam ipse habet:** No one can transfer a greater right than they themselves possess.
    *   *Baltazar v. CA*: The law must protect and prefer the lawful holder of registered title over the transferee of a vendor bereft of any transmissible rights.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Article 1544 (Double Sale):** Inapplicable due to bad faith and forgery.
*   **Torrens System:** While generally allows reliance on the face of the title, this rule doesn't apply when there are suspicious circumstances or a prior validly registered title.
*   ***Dino v. CA*** The court ruled that the burden of proving forgery was not sufficiently met by the respondents

**Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Factual Findings:** The decision heavily relies on the factual findings of the trial court and CA regarding the forgery of documents and lack of good faith. These findings are considered binding unless there is a grave abuse of discretion, which wasn't found.
*   **No clear ambiguous or contentious clauses were found. However, there might have been a reliance on the factual circumstances of the case to prove or disprove good faith.**

**Potential Liabilities:**

*   **Ejectment:** The Mathays are ordered to vacate the property.
*   **Attorney's Fees and Costs:** The Mathays are required to pay attorney's fees and costs (as determined by the trial court).
*   **Recourse against Vendors:** The Mathays' recourse lies against their vendors (Banayo and Pugay) for breach of warranty. (implied warranty against eviction)
