## Legal Document Summary: *Maria De Leon Transportation, Inc. v. Daniel M. Macuray* (G.R. No. 214940, June 06, 2018)

**Nature of the Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court resolving a Petition for Review on Certiorari involving an illegal dismissal claim.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Maria De Leon Transportation, Inc. (Employer)
*   **Respondent:** Daniel M. Macuray (Employee/Bus Driver)

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal Claim:**  The SC reversed the CA ruling of illegal dismissal, finding that the employee was *not* illegally dismissed.  The employee was found to have availed of the company's practice of allowing drivers to take breaks ("sabbaticals") and obtained other work during that time. The SC noted that the employee failed to direct follow-ups regarding his employment to appropriate management personnel.

*   **Abandonment:** The SC rejected the employer's claim of abandonment, noting that the company had a tacit policy of allowing drivers to take breaks from work to avoid fatigue and monotony.

*   **Unpaid Wages/Commissions:** The SC found that the employer failed to pay the employee for three months (January-March 2009), amounting to P30,000.00

*   **Retirement Pay:** Despite the absence of a formal retirement plan and the employee's period of "sabbatical", the SC awarded retirement pay because the employee reached retirement age (60) while nominally employed by the company (based on company policy).  The computation was set at one month's salary (P10,000.00) for every year of service (18 years), totaling P180,000.00, deviating from the CA's application of Article 287 of the Labor Code, which typically awards one-half month salary per year of service.

*   **Other Monetary Claims:**  The SC rescinded the CA's award of separation pay, backwages, service incentive leave pay, moral damages, exemplary damages, and nominal damages due to the finding of no illegal dismissal. However, Attorney's fees of P20,000 was deemed appropriate.

*   **Procedural Issues:** The employer's arguments regarding the late and defective filing of the Petition for Certiorari before the CA was deemed inconsequential, with the SC prioritizing the employee's substantive rights over procedural technicalities, citing *Coronel v. Hon. Desierto, 448 Phil. 894, 903 (2003)*.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer:** Obligated to pay unpaid salaries/commissions (P30,000.00), retirement pay (P180,000.00), and attorney's fees (P20,000.00).
*   **Employee:**  No specific obligations listed but is bound by the SC's determination that he was not illegally dismissed and is only entitled to the monetary awards outlined.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Employer:** Liable for the aforementioned monetary awards, plus interest.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Novel Application of Retirement Provisions:** The ruling establishes a precedent for awarding retirement pay even in the absence of formal dismissal, resignation, or abandonment, and despite the existence of periods of non-performance ("sabbaticals") allowed by employer policy. This may affect future retirement claims against employers with similar tacit policies.
*   **Interpretation of Article 287, Labor Code:** The court chose to make the retirement award more equitable by using one-month salary rather than one-half month due to lower commissions.
*   **Interest:** The employer is liable for interest on the monetary awards, calculated at 12% per annum from the filing of the complaint to June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum thereafter until fully satisfied.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 287:** Retirement Pay (as amended by RA No. 7641)
*   **Civil Code, Article 2208:** Attorney's fees
*   **PD No. 851**: 13th Month Pay
*   **Coronel v. Hon. Desierto, 448 Phil. 894, 903 (2003):** Discretion of courts to relax procedural rules for substantial justice.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The implied "sabbatical" policy is not formally documented, making its existence and scope open to interpretation. The ruling essentially enforces this unwritten policy.
*   The court's decision to deviate from the standard retirement pay calculation (one-half month's salary) under Article 287 based on "equity and justice" introduces a subjective element into the computation.

**Recommendations:**

*   Review the company's informal policy on driver breaks/sabbaticals and formalize it to clarify rights and obligations and to avoid similar disputes in the future.
*   Ensure compliance with minimum wage laws and properly document driver compensation arrangements.
*   Seek advice from labor law experts for the calculation of interests and interpretation.
