**Case Summary: *People v. Battung*, G.R. No. 230717 (2018)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming a RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (illegal sale of *shabu*).

**Holding:** Reversed and set aside the CA decision. Appellant acquitted due to failure of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165:** Illegal sale of dangerous drugs. The prosecution failed to sufficiently establish this beyond a reasonable doubt.

*   **Chain of Custody (Section 21, RA 9165):** The prosecution's failure to comply with the chain of custody requirements outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165 was the primary basis for the acquittal. Specifically, the apprehending officers failed to:
    *   Immediately conduct a physical inventory and photograph the drugs *at the scene* after their seizure and confiscation.
    *   Ensure the presence of required witnesses: (a) a representative from the media, (b) a representative from the DOJ, and (c) any elected public official.

*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165:** The ruling references the IRR and its allowance for non-compliance under "justifiable grounds" if integrity is preserved. However, the prosecution failed to provide any justifiable explanation for the non-compliance.

*   **Amendments by RA 10640:** While noting the 2014 amendments to Section 21 that relaxed witness requirements, the Court applied the *original* provision of Section 21 and its IRR because it was in effect when the offense occurred.

*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court rejected the application of the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty due to the police officers' failure to follow the chain of custody procedures *without justification*. The court stated that the procedure in section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 is a matter of substantive law, and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality.

*   **Corpus Delicti:** Due to the flawed chain of custody, the identity and integrity of the *shabu* (corpus delicti) was not established beyond reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Strict Interpretation of Chain of Custody:** The case demonstrates the Supreme Court's strict interpretation of Section 21, RA 9165 (prior to amendment by RA 10640) regarding the chain of custody. The failure to inventory and photograph *at the scene* with the required witnesses proved fatal to the prosecution's case. The quantity of the drugs was miniscule in this case; therefore, there is a greater need to follow the requirements under section 21 of RA 9165.

*   **"Justifiable Grounds" Requirement:** This case emphasizes that simply stating "justifiable grounds" for non-compliance is insufficient. The prosecution must *prove as a fact* the specific reasons for the deviation, *and* demonstrate the steps taken to preserve the integrity of the evidence. This requires thorough documentation.

*   **Administrative vs. Admissibility:** Note the *ponente's* personal view that non-compliance with chain of custody procedures should primarily trigger administrative sanctions and not necessarily invalidate the seizure. However, this remains a dissenting perspective *within* the decision itself.

*   **Conflicting views on chain of custody:** Ponente is of the opinion that chain of custody is a matter of evidence and a rule of procedure, and that the Court has the last say regarding the appreciation of evidence. Justice Leonardo-De Castro is of the view that if the evidence of illegal drugs was not handled precisely in the manner prescribed by the chain of custody rule, the consequence relates not to inadmissibility that would automatically destroy the prosecution's case but rather to the weight of evidence presented for each particular case.
