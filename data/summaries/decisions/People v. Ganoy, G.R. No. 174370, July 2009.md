## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Ganoy

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Willy Mardo Ganoy y Mamayabay*, G.R. No. 174370, July 23, 2009. Affirms CA decision finding the accused guilty of rape.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Rape under Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code. The information states that the accused, with lewd design, used force and intimidation to have carnal knowledge of the victim (AAA), a 17-year-old.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:**
    *   AAA testified to the rape, including being grabbed, dragged, threatened with a knife, and forced to have intercourse.
    *   Medico-legal report (Exhibit "B") found "findings compatible with recent sexual intercourse" including an abrasion and positive for spermatozoa, but negative for gram-negative diplococci. The Posterior Fourchette was abraded.
    *   AAA reported the crime immediately to the police.
*   **Defense Evidence:**
    *   Accused claimed a consensual relationship since 1998 (victim was 13 at that time). This was contradicted by fact that victim was studying in Bulacan at that time.
    *   Accused alleged the victim was seeking money for an abortion, but lacked supporting medical evidence and was contradicted by her ability to work.
    *   Witness testimony (Raulito Bato and Amy Bilamera) aimed at alibi and consensual act/financial motivation, but inconsistencies weakened credibility.

**Obligations:**

*   The accused has an obligation to disprove the evidence showing his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Reclusion Perpetua (affirmed).
*   **Civil Liability:** P50,000.00 moral damages and P50,000.00 civil indemnity awarded to the victim (affirmed, with the addition of civil indemnity).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility Issues:** The primary issue revolves around the credibility of the witnesses, especially the victim and the accused. The Court emphasizes the trial court's advantage in observing witness demeanor.
*   **"Sweetheart Defense":** Defense's claim of prior consensual relationship significantly weakened by the victim's age at the alleged start of the relationship. The absence of corroborating evidence (love letters, mementos) further undermines this defense.
*  The medico-legal report supports the claim that the victim was raped.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A and 266-B, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **People vs. Mateo:** The intermediate review by the Court of Appeals before elevation to the Supreme Court. G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 7, 2004.

**Conclusion:**

There are no significant ambiguities. The main issue was the credibility of the witnesses, which the courts resolved in favor of the prosecution.
