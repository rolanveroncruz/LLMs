## Legal Document Summary: Tee Ling Kiat v. Ayala Corporation

**Case:** G.R. No. 192530, March 7, 2018 (827 Phil. 288)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Tee Ling Kiat (TLK)
*   **Respondent:** Ayala Corporation (substituted by Bienvenido B.M. Amora, Jr.)

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC's dismissal of TLK's Third-Party Claim against a levy on properties registered under Vonnel Industrial Park, Inc. (VIP).

**Background:** Ayala Corporation obtained a judgment against Continental Manufacturing Corporation (CMC) and Spouses Dee based on a promissory note and surety agreement. Execution was levied on properties registered under VIP, where Dewey Dee (one of the Spouses Dee) was an incorporator. TLK filed a Third-Party Claim, asserting he bought Dewey Dee's shares in VIP *before* the levy.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Third-Party Claim:** TLK claims ownership of VIP shares, alleging a sale from Dewey Dee in 1980. He argues Dewey Dee, no longer a shareholder, has no interest in VIP's assets subject to levy.
*   **Ayala Corporation's Position:** TLK's name doesn't appear in SEC records as a shareholder. No General Information Sheets or Audited Financials were submitted to SEC by VIP.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Denied TLK's claim because: (1) Sale of shares to TLK wasn't proven (not recorded in VIP's stock and transfer book per Section 63 of the Corporation Code), (2) VIP's registration was revoked by SEC, and (3) Indemnity bond sufficient.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC. TLK failed to prove he is a real party-in-interest or a trustee authorized to claim on behalf of VIP.
*   **Petitioner's Arguments on Appeal**: The burden was on Ayala Corporation to prove that VIP did not follow its ordinary course of business, and that the exact shares of stock should have been levied on, not the subject properties.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **Third-Party Claimant (TLK):** Obligation to prove ownership or right of possession over the levied property to sustain the Third-Party Claim.
*   **Corporation (VIP):** Duty to record stock transfers in its books to make them valid against third parties (Section 63, Corporation Code).

**Liabilities:**

*   The liability remains with CMC and the Spouses Dee.
*   This case determined if the properties registered under VIP are covered by the Writ of Execution.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Share Transfer:** Critical issue is the unproven sale of shares from Dewey Dee to TLK. The absence of recordation in VIP's books, and only submission of a photocopy of the Deed of Sale, is detrimental to TLK's claim.
*   **Corporate Veil Piercing:** Although not explicitly argued, the judgment creditor (Ayala) attempts to reach assets registered under VIP (separate juridical entity). This creates risk in the future for shareholder's in closely held corporations.
*   **SEC Revocation of VIP's Registration:** While not the core issue, the revocation raises questions about VIP's corporate standing and capacity to sue.
*   **Sufficiency of the Indemnity Bond** - This point was raised by Tee Ling Kiat as a point of contention, that the value of the bond was less than the value of the subject property.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Section 63, Corporation Code:** Recording of share transfers in corporate books for validity against third parties.
*   **Section 122, Corporation Code:** Corporate liquidation and three-year winding-up period.
*   **Rule 131, Section 3(q), Rules of Court:** Disputable presumption of the ordinary course of business. This was brought up by the petitioner to attempt to shift the burden of proof.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Petition for Review on Certiorari limited to questions of law.
*   *Villasi v. Garcia, 724 Phil. 519, 528 (2014).
*   *Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corp. v. Maunlad Homes, Inc, G.R. No. 215933, February 8, 2017, p. 8.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** The primary contentious point is whether the sale between Dewey Dee and Tee Ling Kiat ever occurred. The Deed of Sale was never entered into corporate books as required by statute.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court **DENIED** TLK's petition, affirming the CA decision. TLK failed to sufficiently prove his ownership of the VIP shares, thus lacking standing to pursue the Third-Party Claim. The levy was upheld, at least up to the interest of the original judgement debtor (Dee).
