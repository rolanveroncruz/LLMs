## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Cacayan*, G.R. No. 180499 (2008)

**Nature:** Appeal of conviction for four counts of rape.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   Accused, Conrado Cacayan, was charged with four counts of rape against his daughter, AAA, committed on different dates in 1997.
*   Accusations involve force, intimidation, and use of a bolo (knife).
*   AAA testified to the rapes, detailing the threats and violence.
*   Medico-legal report corroborated the rapes, showing healed hymenal lacerations consistent with multiple forced sexual acts.
*   Defense presented alibi and character assassination attempts against AAA through testimony from the Defendant's relatives.
*   RTC initially convicted and sentenced Cacayan to death for each count, considering the use of a deadly weapon and relationship as aggravating circumstances under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   CA affirmed the conviction but modified the sentence to *reclusion perpetua* due to failure to adequately establish the victim's minority.

**Obligations:**

*   The defendant is obligated to serve the sentence imposed for the crime of rape.
*   Defendant has a civil obligation to provide civil indemnity, moral and exemplary damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Guilty on four counts of rape. Penalty is *reclusion perpetua* for each count, without eligibility for parole (due to RA 9346 abolishing the death penalty).
*   **Civil Liability:** Liable for:
    *   Civil indemnity of P75,000.00 for each count of rape.
    *   Moral damages of P50,000.00 for each count of rape.
    *   Exemplary damages of P25,000.00 for each count of rape.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Age of Victim:** While the CA downplayed the age of the victim, the SC clarifies that the death penalty was not based on the qualifying circumstance of minority *per se*, but on the use of a deadly weapon and the aggravating circumstance of relationship. This is a key point.
*   **Corroboration:** The defense presented corroborating witnesses (Defendant's relatives) to support the alibi. However, the Court gave little weight to this, noting it as self-serving. This corroboration could be a point to be considered in a possible motion for reconsideration.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The defense argued lack of proof beyond reasonable doubt. The SC relied heavily on the victim's testimony, corroborated by the medical report, and discredited the alibi.
