**Legal Document Summary: A.M. NO. 09-3-50 MCTC (Re: Dropping Ms. Gina P. Fuentes from the Rolls)**

**Subject Matter:** This is a resolution by the Supreme Court addressing the unauthorized absences and subsequent dropping from the rolls of Ms. Gina P. Fuentes, a Court Stenographer I, from her position at the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) of Mabini, Compostela Valley.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Violation of Memorandum Order No. 14-2000:** Fuentes left the country without securing prior permission from the Supreme Court, violating a direct order.  This is the initial trigger for administrative action.
*   **Unauthorized Leave:** Leave applications for March, May, June, and July 2007 were disapproved due to the violation of Memorandum Order No. 14-2000, rendering these absences unauthorized.
*   **Absence Without Official Leave (AWOL):** Fuentes failed to report back to work and did not submit "bundy cards" (time records) after August 2007.
*   **Dropping from the Rolls:** The Court, citing Section 63, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave (as amended by Memorandum Circular 13, series of 2007), orders Fuentes to be dropped from the rolls effective August 1, 2007, due to being AWOL.
*   **Notification Requirement:** The Court directs that Fuentes be notified of her separation at her address on file.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Employment:** Fuentes is terminated from her position due to unauthorized absences and non-compliance with court regulations.
*   **Forfeiture of Rights & Benefits:** Unstated, but implicit, is the potential loss of retirement benefits, accrued leave credits, and other employment-related entitlements due to her dismissal.
*   **Potential Disciplinary Action:** While not explicitly stated, the unauthorized absences and disregard for court regulations could potentially lead to further disciplinary action, depending on internal rules and regulations.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Memorandum Order No. 14-2000:**  This order is the core basis for the finding of unauthorized leave, stipulating that judicial employees need permission to travel abroad.
*   **Section 63, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave (as amended by Memorandum Circular 13, series of 2007):** This provision provides the legal basis for dropping an employee from the rolls due to prolonged AWOL. The *Fernandita B. Borja* case is cited as jurisprudential support.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document is relatively straightforward. However, the *potential application of the provision regarding "scheme to circumvent the rule"* (substantial absences less than 30 days repeated) is a possible area for argument, though it was not directly applied here. The document focuses primarily on the absence greater than 30 days.
*   It's unclear if Fuentes was given a formal Return-to-Work order prior to being dropped from the rolls.  While the document suggests opportunity for explanation, the absence of a specific RTW order may be a procedural challenge.

**Overall Risk Assessment:**

The Supreme Court's decision appears well-supported by the cited regulations and established facts. Fuentes' prolonged absence without permission and failure to return to work provided sufficient grounds for the administrative action. However, the lack of explicit mention of the Return-to-Work order and the ambiguity surrounding its issuance could be points of contention in a challenge to the decision. A careful examination of the administrative record is required to confirm whether a RTW order was in fact issued, its contents, and proof of service. The procedural due process afforded to Ms. Fuentes and any explanation she might have offered are also areas to examine, as they bear on the fairness of the proceedings.
