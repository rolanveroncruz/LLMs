## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Barraquio vs. Almeda Inc.* (G.R. Nos. 169649 & 185594)

**Core Issue:**  Validity of Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs) issued to Domingo Barraquio, specifically whether the subject properties are exempt from Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) coverage due to their classification as industrial rather than agricultural.

**Key Ruling (Motion for Reconsideration Granted):** The Supreme Court reversed its earlier decision and ruled in favor of Almeda Inc., affirming the cancellation/nullification of the CLOAs issued to Domingo Barraquio, due to the land's industrial classification. The properties are deemed exempt from CARP.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **CARP Exemption:** This is the central issue. The document hinges on whether the properties were correctly classified as industrial, thus exempting them from CARP under R.A. 6657.
*   **Motion for New Trial Based on Newly Discovered Evidence:** The petitioners' Motion to Admit Newly Discovered Evidence was denied.  The Court found it was filed out of time and failed to meet the requisites for newly discovered evidence as provided in Rule 37 and Rule 53 of the Rules of Court.

**Liabilities:**

*   Heirs of Barraquio: Loss of ownership/agrarian reform benefits associated with the cancelled CLOAs.
*   Almeda Inc.: No liability; their right to the properties as industrial land is upheld.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Newly Discovered Evidence Criteria:**  The court found the evidence *was not* newly discovered because the petitioners failed to demonstrate due diligence in obtaining and presenting the evidence earlier.  Specifically, failure to provide SB Municipal Ordinance No. 18, Series of 1981, and failure to explain why.
*   **Conflicting Land Use Classifications:** The document highlights inconsistent certifications regarding the land use (agricultural vs. industrial). The resolution of the case hinged on discounting the petitioners' evidence and crediting the DAR's findings.
*   **Forum Shopping:**  Almeda Inc. alleged that the Heirs of Barraquio are guilty of forum shopping, although the Court's ruling primarily hinged on the failure to meet the newly discovered evidence standard.
*   **Res Judicata:**  Almeda Inc. argued that the Supreme Court's judgment in G.R. No. 169649 will amount to res judicata in the other Petition.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6657:**  The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, the basis for determining CARP coverage.
*   **Rules of Court, Rules 37 and 53:**  Governing motions for new trial based on newly discovered evidence.
*   **Baclig v. Rural Bank of Cabugao, Inc. (G.R. No. 230200, July 3, 2023)**:  Cited regarding the procedure for invoking newly-discovered evidence.
*   **Office of the Ombudsman v. Coronel, 526 Phil. 351 (2006)**: Cited regarding the requirement to prove diligence in discovering the evidence.
*   **Ybiernas v. Tanco-Gabaldon, 665 Phil. 297 (2011)**:  Discusses the due diligence requirement for newly discovered evidence and what can be considered 'reasonable promptness'.

**Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **The nature of the evidence presented as 'newly discovered',** specifically whether the 2013 Certifications and the underlying SB Municipal Ordinance could have been discovered with due diligence before the trial.
*   **The conflicting certifications** from HLURB and local government units regarding land use classification.

**Overall Analysis:**

The case underscores the stringent requirements for introducing newly discovered evidence, particularly the need to demonstrate due diligence in its discovery and presentation. The court's decision highlights the importance of providing comprehensive and consistent documentation in land use classification disputes and the weight given to DAR's findings in CARP-related issues. The failure to submit SB Municipal Ordinance No. 18 proved fatal to the Heirs' argument, as it could have potentially supported their claim of the land being agricultural. This case reinforces the principle that procedural lapses can significantly impact substantive rights.
