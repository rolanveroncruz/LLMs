## Legal Document Summary: *Rementizo v. Heirs of Madarieta*, 596 Phil. 120 (2009)

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review of a Court of Appeals decision that declared void an Emancipation Patent (EP) issued to Petitioner Rementizo. The Supreme Court reversed the CA, finding that the action to annul the EP was barred by prescription.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over Lot No. 153-F in Mambajao, Camiguin, originally owned by Angel Madarieta (deceased, represented by his heirs). Rementizo, allegedly a tenant of Roque Luspo (not Madarieta), was issued EP No. A-028390-H for the lot under Operation Land Transfer (OLT) pursuant to P.D. No. 27.
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   Madarieta filed a complaint before DARAB seeking annulment of Rementizo's EP and title.
    *   Provincial Adjudicator ruled in favor of Madarieta.
    *   DARAB reversed, upholding Rementizo's title, citing Madarieta's inaction during Angel's lifetime.
    *   CA initially affirmed DARAB, then reversed on reconsideration, declaring the EP void.
    *   This petition before the Supreme Court.
*   **Key Dates:**
    *   1987: EP No. A-028390-H issued to Rementizo and OCT No. EP-195 registered in Rementizo's name.
    *   1998: Madarieta filed the complaint to annul EP.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Rementizo:** Obligation is to respect ownership rights if EP is invalid. Potential liability is dispossession if EP is successfully challenged.
*   **Heirs of Madarieta:** Obligation is to prove their claim of ownership and that the EP was improperly issued. Liability for costs if unsuccessful.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Prescription:** The central issue is whether the action for annulment (effectively, an action for reconveyance) has prescribed. The Supreme Court finds that it *has* prescribed, as more than 10 years elapsed between the issuance of the EP (1987) and the filing of the complaint (1998).
*   **Fraud:** Madarieta alleged the inclusion of Lot No. 153-F in Operation Land Transfer was erroneous ("landgrabbing"). However, the court found no evidence of *actual fraud* on the part of Rementizo.  The absence of fraud distinguishes the case from *GSIS v. Santiago*, 460 Phil. 763 (2003); *Samonte v. Court of Appeals*, 413 Phil. 487 (2001); and *Adille v. Court of Appeals*, 241 Phil. 487 (1988).
*   **Notice:**  Madarieta claimed lack of notice regarding the land transfer, but the Court noted that Angel Madarieta did not object during his lifetime despite Rementizo's visible possession, suggesting acquiescence or recognition of Rementizo's rights.
*   **Tenancy Relationship:** Rementizo was allegedly a tenant of Luspo, not Madarieta.  The potential implication is that Rementizo might not have been a qualified beneficiary for Lot 153-F.
*   **Nature of Action:**  The SC characterizes Madarieta's claim as an action for reconveyance based on an implied or constructive trust. *Caro v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 76148, 20 December 1989, 180 SCRA 401, is cited regarding the prescriptive period.

**Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 27:**  Presidential Decree No. 27, the Tenant Emancipation Decree, which is the basis for Operation Land Transfer.
*   **Article 1144 of the Civil Code:** Establishes the 10-year prescriptive period for obligations created by law.
*   **Article 1106 of the Civil Code:** Provides for prescription as a means to acquire or lose rights and actions.

**Case Law:**

*   The decision explicitly cites *Bustarga v. Navo II*, 214 Phil. 86 (1984), concerning erroneous awards under OLT.
*   *Bishop v. Court of Appeals*, 208 SCRA 637 (related to prescriptive periods).

*   *Quitoriano v. Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board*, G.R. No. 171184, 4 March2008, 547 SCRA 617 (fraud must be alleged and proven).
*   *Pasi√±o v. Monterroyo, G.R. No. 159494, 31 July 2008, citing Mendizabel v. Apao, G.R. No. 143185, 20 February 2006, 482 SCRA 587*.

*  *GSIS v. Santiago*, 460 Phil. 763 (2003).
* *Samonte v. Court of Appeals*, 413 Phil. 487 (2001).
*   *Adille v. Court of Appeals*, 241 Phil. 487 (1988).

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court found that the action for annulment was barred by prescription, reversing the Court of Appeals and upholding Rementizo's title. The key factor was the lack of evidence of *actual fraud* on Rementizo's part and the passage of more than 10 years from the EP issuance. This highlights the importance of timely action in challenging land titles and the requirement of proving fraud with clear and convincing evidence in reconveyance cases.
