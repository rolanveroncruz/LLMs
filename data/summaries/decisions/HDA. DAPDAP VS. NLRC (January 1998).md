## Legal Document Summary: Hda. Dapdap I and/or Lumbia Agricultural and Development Corporation vs. NLRC and NFSW-FGT/Pedro Barrientos Jr.

**Case:** G.R. No. 120556, January 26, 1998

**Nature:** Special civil action for certiorari assailing the NLRC decision affirming the Labor Arbiter's finding of illegal dismissal.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Hda. Dapdap I and/or Lumbia Agricultural and Development Corporation (LADCOR)
*   **Respondents:** National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) and National Federation of Sugar Workers Food and General Trades (NFSW-FGT)/Pedro Barrientos Jr.

**Key Provisions and Factual Background:**

*   **Complaint:** Pedro Barrientos Jr. (initially with others who later withdrew) filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, alleging unjust termination without notice or valid ground on 27 January 1992. Alleges dismissal was due to refusal to return land previously given under a settlement agreement.
*   **Amended Complaint:** Impleaded LADCOR as the real owner of Hda. Dapdap I.
*   **LADCOR's Defense:** Denied termination; alleged voluntary abandonment by Barrientos to work on another farm after 1 March 1992. Claimed corporate separateness from Magdalena Fermin.
*   **Labor Arbiter Decision:** Ruled in favor of Barrientos, finding illegal dismissal. Rejected LADCOR's abandonment defense, citing *Chong Guan Trading v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 81471, 26 April 1989, 172 SCRA 831) regarding illogicality of abandoning work and then immediately filing for reinstatement. Awarded separation pay, back wages, and attorney's fees.
*   **NLRC Decision:** Affirmed the Labor Arbiter *in toto*. Added lack of notice of dismissal to Barrientos, violating Sec. 2, Rule 14, Book V, of the Rules Implementing the Labor Code. Cited lack of evidence showing intent to abandon employment.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Dismissed the petition. Upheld NLRC's decision. Affirmed the Arbiterâ€™s and NLRC's findings.
    *   Restated that Supreme Court is not a trier of facts.
    *   Emphasized the binding nature of factual findings of labor tribunals when affirmed by the NLRC.
    *   Reiterated limited judicial review to issues of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.
    *   Cited *Santos v. NLRC* (G. R. No. 76991, 28 October 1988, 166 SCRA 759, 764-765) and other related cases. that charge of abandonment is inconsistent with filing a complaint for illegal dismissal.
*   **Award:** Affirmed the award of back wages (P30,368.00), separation pay (P15,184.00), and attorney's fees (P4,555.20).

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **LADCOR:** Liable for illegal dismissal and ordered to pay back wages, separation pay, and attorney's fees to Pedro Barrientos Jr.
*   **Employer's Obligation:** To provide written notice of dismissal, stating grounds for dismissal, as mandated by Sec. 2, Rule 14, Book V, of the Rules Implementing the Labor Code. Failure to do so strengthens the finding of illegal dismissal.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute on Abandonment:** The core issue revolves around whether Barrientos voluntarily abandoned his work or was illegally dismissed. The Labor Arbiter and NLRC's rejection of the abandonment defense hinges on the immediate filing of the illegal dismissal case.
*   **Corporate Veil:** While the original complaint also named Magdalena Fermin personally, this aspect was not a central issue in the final ruling, as the focus shifted to LADCOR's liability. The claim of corporate separateness from Magdalena Fermin, while presented, did not shield LADCOR from liability.
*   **Amount of Separation Pay:** Separation pay was computed from 1986, potentially arising from a prior "Amicable Settlement". Understanding the details of that prior settlement and its terms is crucial.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Chong Guan Trading v. NLRC** (G.R. No. 81471, 26 April 1989, 172 SCRA 831): Cited by the Labor Arbiter to support the finding that filing of the complaint negates abandonment.
*   **Santos v. National Labor Relations Commission** (G. R. No. 76991, 28 October 1988, 166 SCRA 759, 764-765): Re-emphasizes the principle that a charge of abandonment is totally inconsistent with the immediate filing of a complaint for illegal dismissal.
*   *Judric Canning Corporation v. Inciong*, G. R. No. 51494, 19 August 1982, 115 SCRA 887, 890. Quoted that "To get a job is difficult; to run from it is foolhardy."
*   Other supporting citations regarding the binding nature of NLRC factual findings and limited scope of judicial review.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Impliedly involved through the finding of illegal dismissal.
*   **Rules Implementing the Labor Code, Sec. 2, Rule 14, Book V:** Mandates written notice of dismissal.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "Amicable Settlement" from 1986 warrants scrutiny. Its impact on the current award, particularly the calculation of separation pay from 1986, requires further investigation.

This summary provides a legally precise overview of the key aspects of the case. Further investigation may be necessary to fully assess the details of the 1986 settlement.
