## Legal Document Summary: *Home Development Mutual Fund v. Court of Appeals and Dr. Cora J. Virata (CONVIR) and Associates, Inc.* G.R. No. 118972, April 3, 1998

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court decision affirming the Court of Appeals' decision, holding HDMF liable for breach of a Consultancy Agreement.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Consultancy Agreement:** CONVIR obligated to provide medical services to HDMF employees from January 1, 1985 to December 31, 1985.
*   **Termination Clause:** Agreement could be terminated by either party with 30 days' written notice.
*   **Implied Renewal:** The agreement had been renewed annually since 1981, creating a practice of continued services even before formal contract renewal.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Breach of Contract:** HDMF breached the agreement by failing to provide 30 days' notice of termination and effectively terminating the agreement only nine days after its expiration.
*   **Compensatory Damages:** Initially awarded by the trial court but deleted by the Court of Appeals due to lack of sufficient evidence.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** HDMF was held liable for attorney's fees due to bad faith in terminating the contract.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguous Termination:** The HDMF argued that the contract simply expired and no termination notice was needed. The Court rejected this, interpreting the termination clause to apply even at the end of the original term.
*   **Lack of Good Faith:**  The Court determined that HDMF did not act in good faith by allowing CONVIR to continue providing services into the new year, reinforcing the expectation of renewal and failing to strictly adhere to the 30-day notice requirement.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1159, New Civil Code:** Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law.
*   **Article 1308, New Civil Code:** Mutuality of contracts, prohibiting unilateral termination.
*   **Article 1374, New Civil Code:** Stipulations of a contract should be interpreted together.
*   **Article 1196, New Civil Code:** Presumption that a period designated is for the benefit of both contracting parties.
*   **Article 2208, New Civil Code:** Award of attorney's fees in cases of bad faith.
*   **Section 11, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court**: Construing an instrument where there are several provisions.
*   ***Baluran vs. Navarro, 79 SCRA 309***: Method of terminating a contract is primarily determined by the stipulation of the parties.
*   ***Spouses Mariano and Gilda Florendo vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 101771, December 17, 1996***: unilateral termination of the contract is violative of the principle of mutuality of contracts.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of the termination clause was the central contentious issue.  HDMF argued that the clause only applied to termination *during* the contract term, not at the end. The Court rejected this narrow interpretation.

**Overall Assessment:**

The HDMF was found liable for failing to properly terminate the Consultancy Agreement, due to failing to give the notice as agreed upon in the contract. The ruling underscores the importance of strict compliance with contractual terms, especially notice requirements, and reinforces the principle of good faith in contractual dealings. The established course of dealing (prior years' renewals without formal notice) played a significant role in the Court's decision.
