**Case Summary: U-Bix Corporation v. Milliken & Company, et al., G.R. No. 173318 (Sept. 23, 2008)**

**Core Issue:** Tortious interference with contract (Art. 1314, Civil Code) and breach of a dealership agreement.

**Key Facts:**

*   U-Bix was a dealer of Milliken carpets. Milliken later appointed Projexx Creator as another dealer.
*   U-Bix alleges Milliken breached their dealership agreement by appointing Projexx, after U-Bix initiated work on the Chase Manhattan Bank (CMB) project. They further alleged that Projexx, aided by Eser (a former U-Bix employee who joined Projexx), maliciously interfered with U-Bix's potential contract with CMB.
*   U-Bix failed to secure the CMB project, which was ultimately awarded to Projexx.
*   U-Bix sued Milliken, Projexx, and others for breach of contract, tortious interference, and damages.

**Court Holdings:**

*   **Demurrer to Evidence Granted:** The RTC granted the defendants' demurrers to evidence, finding that no contract was ever perfected between U-Bix and CMB. The CA affirmed this decision.
*   **No Tortious Interference:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA, holding that U-Bix failed to prove the elements of tortious interference as the record lacked proof of a valid contract between U-Bix and CMB (Lagon v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 119107, 18 March 2005, 453 SCRA 616, 624 and Tayag v. Lacson, G.R. No. 134971, 25 March 2004, 426 SCRA 282, 305). The absence of a valid contract is fatal to a claim under Article 1314.
*   **Factual Findings Binding:** The Supreme Court emphasized that factual findings of the trial court, when affirmed by the CA, are generally binding.  Only questions of law may be raised in a Rule 45 petition.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Dealership Agreement:** Defined obligations of Milliken (support marketing, exclusive project designation upon submission of dealer project registration form) and U-Bix (market carpets, maintain stock).  The trigger for Milliken's obligation of exclusive project designation was *submission* of the dealer project registration form.
*   **Art. 1314, Civil Code:** Liability for tortious interference requires (a) a valid contract; (b) knowledge of the contract by the interfering party; and (c) unjustified interference.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Lack of Formal Project Registration:** U-Bix failed to submit a formal dealer project registration form for the CMB project, as required by the dealership agreement.  This was critical in negating their claim to exclusivity regarding the project.
*   **Factual Dispute:** The case turned primarily on factual issues (whether a contract existed, whether there was interference) rather than legal issues.  The absence of a contract was a key factual finding.
*   **Ambiguity:** The language defining when a project becomes “exclusively” U-Bix's could be a source of future disputes. It emphasizes the submission of a form, not merely the initiation of work on a project.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Lagon v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 119107, 18 March 2005, 453 SCRA 616, 624:**  Establishes elements of tortious interference.
*   **Tayag v. Lacson, G.R. No. 134971, 25 March 2004, 426 SCRA 282, 305:** Further elaborates on tortious interference.

**Strategic Implications:**

*   Dealers must strictly comply with project registration requirements in dealership agreements to establish exclusive rights.
*   Demonstrating the existence of a valid contract is a prerequisite to any claim of tortious interference.
*   The decision reinforces the principle that factual findings of lower courts are generally binding on the Supreme Court.
