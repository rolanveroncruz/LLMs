## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Montinola* (G.R. No. 178061)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the trial court's conviction of John Montinola for rape, attempted rape (3 counts), and acts of lasciviousness against his minor daughter, AAA.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision with modifications. Montinola's convictions were upheld.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rape (Crim. Case No. 02-720):** Conviction upheld under Article 266(a) of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353 in relation to RA 7610).
*   **Attempted Rape (Crim. Cases No. 02-721, 02-723, 02-724):** Convictions upheld.
*   **Acts of Lasciviousness (Crim. Case No. 02-725):** Conviction upheld, but re-classified and re-penalized under **Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610** (Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse), instead of Section 10(a). The Court considered the aggravating circumstance of relationship under Article 15 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Civil Liabilities:** Significant modifications to monetary awards for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages were ordered.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Rape:** Reclusion Perpetua, P75,000 civil indemnity, P75,000 moral damages, P25,000 exemplary damages.
*   **Attempted Rape (each count):** Indeterminate penalty of 4 years and 2 months of *prision correccional* to 10 years of *prision mayor*, P30,000 civil indemnity, P25,000 moral damages, P10,000 exemplary damages.
*   **Acts of Lasciviousness:** Reclusion Perpetua, P15,000 moral damages, P15,000 fine.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The re-classification of the acts of lasciviousness conviction under RA 7610 might raise *ex post facto* concerns. However, the change aligns with the nature of the crime and the existing penalties, potentially mitigating this risk.
*   The reliance on the victim's testimony, while deemed credible, could be challenged based on inconsistencies, though minor inconsistencies are expected in cases of this nature due to the traumatic experiences and minor inconsistencies, if exploited, may weaken the case.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 266(a):** Rape
*   **Republic Act No. 8353:** Amendment to the Revised Penal Code on rape.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The reclassification of acts of lasciviousness conviction under Section 5(b) of RA 7610, while ultimately upheld, may be contested as it carries a heavier penalty, although this was justified by the presence of aggravating circumstances.
*   Potential exists for challenging the credibility of the victim's testimony based on minor inconsistencies, though this was already addressed by both the trial court and appellate court.
