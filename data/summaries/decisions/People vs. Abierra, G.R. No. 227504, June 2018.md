Here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Alex Abierra, G.R. No. 227504, June 13, 2018*

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of a conviction for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Treachery:**  Court affirmed the CA's finding that treachery qualified the killing to Murder.  Victim was unsuspecting, unarmed, and had no chance to resist a sudden attack. Means were deliberately employed to ensure the attack's success.
*   **Evident Premeditation:** The Court agreed with the CA that the prosecution failed to prove evident premeditation beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution did not present evidence to demonstrate WHEN and HOW the accused specifically planned and prepared for the crime.  A lapse of 15 minutes between the initial altercation and the attack was insufficient time for reflection, citing *People v. Illescas* (396 Phil. 200) and *People v. Dadivo* (434 Phil. 684).  The decision to kill wasn't preceded by cool thought and reflection.
*   **Witness Credibility:** Court affirmed the trial court's finding that the prosecution's eyewitness (the victim's brother) was credible and reliable. His positive identification of the accused outweighed the accused's denial and alibi. The court rejects the argument of unnatural behavior of the witness while being at the scene.
*   **Alibi:** Alex Abierra's defense of alibi, corroborated by relatives and friends, was rejected due to the positive identification by the prosecution's witness.

**Obligations:**

*   **Alex Abierra:** Obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for Murder.
*   **Alex Abierra:** Obligated to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, and temperate damages to the heirs of the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Alex Abierra found guilty of Murder.
*   **Civil Liability:** Alex Abierra liable for damages to the heirs of the victim.

**Damages Awarded:**

*   Civil indemnity: Php 75,000.00
*   Moral damages: Php 75,000.00
*   Exemplary damages: Php 75,000.00 (increased from CA's Php 30,000.00)
*   Temperate damages: Php 50,000.00 (increased from CA's Php 25,000.00, exceeding actual damages proven)
*   Interest: 6% per annum from the finality of the decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Further appeal is possible, but unlikely to succeed given the Supreme Court's affirmation of the conviction. The standard of *beyond a reasonable doubt* had been met.
