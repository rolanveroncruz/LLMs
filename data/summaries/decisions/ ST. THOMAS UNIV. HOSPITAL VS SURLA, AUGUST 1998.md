**Case:** *Santo Tomas University Hospital vs. Cesar Antonio Y. Surla and Evangeline Surla*, G.R. No. 129718, August 17, 1998 (355 Phil. 804)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reviewed a Court of Appeals decision upholding the dismissal of Santo Tomas University Hospital's (STUH) compulsory counterclaim in a damages suit filed by the Surlas. The Surlas sued STUH after their prematurely born son allegedly fell from his incubator. STUH filed a counterclaim for unpaid hospital bills (P82,632.10) and damages (moral, exemplary) plus attorney's fees, alleging a malicious suit. The trial court dismissed the entire counterclaim for STUH's failure to attach a certificate of non-forum shopping as required by Administrative Circular No. 04-94.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Administrative Circular No. 04-94:** Requires a certificate of non-forum shopping for "original civil complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim, third (fourth, etc.) party complaint, or complaint-in-intervention, petition, or application wherein a party asserts his claim for relief."
*   **Counterclaim Classification:** Differentiates between a "permissive counterclaim" and a "compulsory counterclaim".

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Forum Shopping:** The purpose of Administrative Circular No. 04-94 is to prevent forum shopping.
*   **Dismissal of Claims:** Failure to comply with the certificate requirement can lead to dismissal of claims.
*   **Damages:** Potential liability for moral and exemplary damages if STUH failed to provide appropriate care and caused injury to the child.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Administrative Circular No. 04-94 (now superseded by Rule 7, Section 5 of the Rules of Civil Procedure):** Addressed the issue of the non-forum shopping certificate requirement.
*   **Rule 8, Section 6 of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure**: Defines compulsory counterclaims as one which, arising out of the same transaction and occurrence as the original claim.
*   **Investments, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 147 SCRA 334; Denso (Phils.,) Inc. vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 148 SCRA 280** (Distinction between Final and Interlocutory orders.)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Application of Circular 04-94 to Compulsory Counterclaims:** The core issue is whether the non-forum shopping requirement applies to *compulsory* counterclaims, given their inherent connection to the main claim. The lower courts interpreted the circular broadly.
*   **Severability of Claims:** The Supreme Court held that the hospital bill claim *was* subject to the circular, but the damages claim *was not*, suggesting that the counterclaim contained two distinct causes of action, one initiatory and one not.

**Supreme Court Holding**

1.  **Certiorari Appropriateness:** While the dismissal order was technically final, the Court deemed certiorari appropriate because an appeal would be ineffective given the lack of evidence on record due to the dismissal.
2.  **Administrative Circular 04-94 Interpretation:** The Court clarified that Administrative Circular No. 04-94's purpose is to prevent forum shopping in *initiatory* pleadings. A compulsory counterclaim for damages stemming from the plaintiff's suit is not an initiatory pleading in this sense.  However, the claim for unpaid hospital bills *is* initiatory and thus subject to the non-forum shopping rule.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court partially granted the petition, reinstating the portion of STUH's counterclaim seeking moral, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. The claim for unpaid hospital bills remained dismissed due to the lack of a certificate of non-forum shopping.
