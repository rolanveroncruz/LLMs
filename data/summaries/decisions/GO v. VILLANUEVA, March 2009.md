**Case Summary: *Jimmy T. Go v. Clerk of Court, et al.*, G.R. No. 154623 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the RTC's order granting a preliminary injunction to restrain the execution of a judgment in a collection suit.

**Facts:**

*   Multi-Luck Corporation obtained a final judgment in RTC Bacolod against Alberto Looyuko/Noah's Ark Merchandising, Inc. (NAMI) for dishonored checks.
*   Execution was levied on properties registered in the name of Looyuko and NAMI.
*   Jimmy Go, claiming to be Looyuko's "business partner" and co-owner of the properties, filed an injunction suit in RTC Pasig, seeking to stop the auction sale.
*   RTC Pasig initially granted a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction.
*   Multi-Luck appealed to the CA, arguing that the Pasig RTC lacked jurisdiction to interfere with a co-equal court's judgment.
*   CA reversed the Pasig RTC, holding that it interfered with the jurisdiction of the Bacolod RTC.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Doctrine of Non-Interference:** Can a court interfere via injunction with the judgments or orders of another court of concurrent jurisdiction?
*   **Third-Party Claim:** Is the petitioner a "third-party claimant" entitled to protection under Rule 39, Section 16 of the Rules of Court?
*   **Validity of Partnership Agreements:** The claimed partnership agreements of February 9, 1982, and October 10, 1986, are questionable. Looyuko has pending litigation claiming forgery.
*   **Estoppel:** Is the petitioner estopped from claiming co-ownership considering NAMI operated as a sole proprietorship for a long time?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA's decision.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Non-Interference:** The Pasig RTC's injunction interfered with the Bacolod RTC's jurisdiction. *Aquino, Sr. v. Valenciano* and *Philippine National Bank v. Pineda* reiterate this doctrine.  Execution proceedings are considered part of the original suit, retaining the original court's jurisdiction.
*   **Third-Party Claim:** The Bacolod RTC had jurisdiction to determine ownership claims related to the execution.  The *Santos v. Bayhon* exception (regarding Labor Arbiters and property ownership) is inapplicable because the Bacolod RTC had the power to resolve the matter of property ownership.
*   **Lack of Clear Right:** The petitioner failed to establish a clear and unmistakable right to the properties to warrant injunctive relief. *Republic v. Judge Villarama*. The alleged partnership agreements are of dubious authenticity, and NAMI operated as a sole proprietorship, creating an issue of equitable estoppel.
*   **Estoppel:** The annotation of an adverse claim does not establish co-ownership. It merely indicates a claim to it and the intent to litigate the claim. Adverse claims are only valid for 30 days without further action. The SC cited *Heirs of Joaquin Asuncion versus Margarito Gervacio, Jr.*, on the requirement for a clear, unquestioned title when seeking injunction.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The Clerk of Court and Sheriffs of Negros Occidental are obligated to proceed with the execution of the Bacolod RTC's judgment.
*   Petitioner, Jimmy Go, is liable for costs.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Petitioner faces the risk of losing claimed co-ownership of the properties if the judgment is executed and his claims under the partnership agreement are not successfully litigated in the appropriate forum.
*   Multi-Luck Corporation risks potential future litigation from Jimmy Go regarding the alleged partnership and co-ownership if Go pursues separate legal action.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 39, Section 16, Rules of Court (Third-Party Claims)
*   Rule 58, Section 3, Rules of Court (Grounds for Issuance of Preliminary Injunction)
*   Presidential Decree No. 1529, Section 70 (Adverse Claims)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The alleged partnership agreements are under dispute, particularly the authenticity of Looyuko's signatures.
*   The scope of the agreement's coverage ("all properties and monies belonging to Looyuko/NAMI") is broad and open to interpretation.

**Case Law Cited:**

*   *Aquino, Sr. v. Valenciano* (Jurisdiction: Non-interference by co-equal courts)
*   *Philippine National Bank v. Pineda* (Jurisdiction: Non-interference by co-equal courts)
*   *Santos v. Bayhon* (Exception to non-interference where the first court lacks jurisdiction over the ownership issue)
*   *Republic of the Philippines v. Judge Villarama, Jr.* (Requirements for Issuance of Preliminary Injunction)
*   *Heirs of Joaquin Asuncion versus Margarito Gervacio, Jr.* (Lack of clear title as grounds for denying injunction)
