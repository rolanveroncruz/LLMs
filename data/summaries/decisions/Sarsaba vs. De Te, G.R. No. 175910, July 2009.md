## Legal Document Summary: *Atty. Rogelio E. Sarsaba v. Fe Vda. de Te* (G.R. No. 175910)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the RTC's interlocutory order denying the petitioner's Omnibus Motion to Dismiss in a case for recovery of a motor vehicle.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Underlying Labor Case:** The case stems from a satisfied NLRC judgment in favor of Patricio Sereno against Teodoro Gasing. An alias writ of execution resulted in the levy and sale of a truck, with Sereno as the highest bidder.
*   **RTC Complaint:** Fe Vda. de Te (represented by Attorney-in-Fact Faustino Casta単eda) filed a complaint in the RTC for recovery of the truck, alleging ownership and that Gasing only rented the truck.
*   **Petitioner's Arguments:** Petitioner (Atty. Sarsaba, counsel for Sereno) filed motions to dismiss, arguing: (1) lack of respondent's legal personality, (2) failure to state a cause of action, and (3) lack of affidavit of merit and bond. Later, he argued the RTC lacked jurisdiction over Sereno (due to his death before summons) and Casta単eda lost legal personality due to Fe Vda. de Te's death.
*   **RTC Rulings:** The RTC denied the motions to dismiss. It held that while it lacked jurisdiction over Sereno, the case against the other defendants could proceed. It also held that despite Fe Vda. de Te's death and the termination of the special power of attorney, Casta単eda could continue prosecuting the case because the cause of action survived the death of the plaintiff.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioner's Liability:** Potential liability for damages if the RTC ultimately rules against him in the recovery of motor vehicle case.
*   **Sereno's Estate Liability:** Sereno's estate faces a potential claim for recovery of the truck.
*   **Procedural Risk:** Petitioner's appeal directly from the RTC to the Supreme Court via Rule 45 was improper because the RTC order was interlocutory. This case establishes a legal precedent regarding the issue of filing cases to a higher court without due process.
*   **Succession Issues:** The case touches upon matters of legal personality, substitution of parties, and the effect of death on agency relationships.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 45 (mode of appeal), Rule 41 (appealable orders), Rule 16 (motion to dismiss), Rule 3, Sec. 16 (substitution of parties), Rule 87, Sec. 1 (actions surviving death).
*   **Civil Code:** Article 1919(3) (extinguishment of agency by death of principal), Article 1930 (agency in common interest).
*   **Relevant Jurisprudence:** Cites *Cucueco v. Court of Appeals*, *First Bancorp, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,* *Philippine Computer Solutions, Inc. v. Hernandez*, *Madrigal Transport, Inc. v. Lapanday Holdings Corporation*, and *Gonzales v. Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation*, and *Vergara, Sr. v. Suelto*, among others, for principles regarding questions of law vs. fact, final vs. interlocutory orders, proper modes of appeal, hierarchy of courts, actions surviving death, and substitution of parties.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Legal Issues:**

*   **Continuing Authority of Attorney-in-Fact:** Whether Casta単eda could continue representing the deceased respondent given that the Special Power of Attorney had become *functus officio*. The court ruled against this claim, but only to the extent that the heirs may replace the counsel with the attorney-in-fact.
*   **Effect of Sereno's Death:** The effect of Sereno's death *prior* to service of summons on the jurisdiction of the RTC over him and the other defendants. The RTC correctly dismissed the claim against Sereno, but allowed the case to proceed against other defendants who were properly served.
*   **Propriety of Direct Appeal:** The Court emphasized that because the Motion to Dismiss was interlocutory, the proper procedure would be to present the concerns of the party to the trial, and should there be an unfavorable verdict, that ruling could be subjected to appeal in due process.
