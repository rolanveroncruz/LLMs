**A.M. No. MTJ-09-1733: Winternitz and Gonzalez v. Judge Gutierrez-Torres - Summary**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Judge Lizabeth Gutierrez-Torres for undue delay in resolving a Motion to Withdraw Informations filed by the City Prosecutor pursuant to a DOJ directive, and for failure to timely submit comments requested by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Rule 3.05, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct:** Judge's duty to dispose of court business promptly and decide cases within prescribed periods. Constitutional mandate for lower courts to decide matters within three (3) months of submission.
*   **SC Administrative Circular No. 13-87 and No. 1-88:** Guidelines to ensure prompt disposition of judicial business. Judges must act promptly on motions.
*   **Obligation to comply with OCA directives:** Judge's duty to respect and obey lawful orders from the OCA, which supervises lower courts.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Undue Delay:** Found guilty of undue delay in resolving the Motion to Withdraw Informations (Criminal Case Nos. 84382, 84383, and 84384) despite it being submitted for resolution on January 13, 2003. The delay was not excused by caseload or lack of notice as almost a year had passed, and judge had a duty to comply with the Code of Judicial Conduct. The resolution came after the filing of the administrative complaint.
*   **Disobedience:** Failed to timely comply with the OCA's directives to file comments on the administrative complaints.
*   **Prior Offenses:** This was the Judge's third offense of undue delay.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** Judge claimed heavy caseload and lack of personnel contributed to the delay, which the Court did not find exculpatory. Lack of notice to private complainant, which the judge claimed as a reason for delay was also found unmeritorious due to the lapse of time since the motion was filed.
*   **Severity of Penalty:** The judge was previously fined for similar infractions and warned of more severe punishment.
*   **Impact on Public Perception:** The Court emphasized the importance of prompt disposition of cases to maintain public faith in the judiciary.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 7, Section 15 of the 1987 Constitution:** Mandates prompt resolution of cases.
*   **Bangco v. Gatdula, A.M. No. MTJ-00-1297, March 7, 2002:** Underscores the importance of timely justice and its impact on public confidence.
*   **Rule 140, as amended, of the Revised Rules of Court:** Defines undue delay as a less serious charge, punishable by suspension or fine.
*   **A.M. No. MTJ-05-1611, "Del Mundo v. Gutierrez-Torres" and A.M. No. MTJ-06-1653, "Gonzalez v. Torres":** Prior administrative cases against the judge for undue delay.
*   **Re: Request for the Expeditious Resolution of Case Nos. 4666 to 4669, A.M. No. 04-6-141-MTC, September 20, 2005:** Highlights the need for respect for authority within the judiciary.

**Outcome:**

*   Judge suspended from office without salary and benefits for one (1) month, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same act shall be dealt with more severely.
