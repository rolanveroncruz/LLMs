## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Garchitorena*, G.R. No. 184172

**Type:** Supreme Court Resolution affirming Court of Appeals decision, upholding Regional Trial Court conviction.

**Subject:** Parricide

**Parties:**

*   **Appellant:** Luis Antonio Garchitorena (convicted)
*   **Appellee:** The People of the Philippines (prosecution)

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Parricide under the Revised Penal Code (RPC), specifically the unlawful killing of his wife, Flordeliza Tabla Garchitorena.
*   **Elements of Parricide Proven:** The Court found that all elements of parricide were satisfied: 1) death of the victim; 2) death caused by the accused; 3) victim was the legitimate spouse of the accused.
*   **Prosecution's Case:** Primarily relies on circumstantial evidence due to the lack of direct eyewitnesses. Key evidence includes:
    *   Appellant's presence at the scene (bedroom).
    *   Argument between the spouses immediately prior to the shooting.
    *   Appellant possessing the firearm.
    *   Inconsistencies in Appellant's statements to police and during trial.
    *   Medico-legal evidence (bullet trajectory and lack of gunpowder on victim's hands).
*   **Defense's Case:** Claims the victim committed suicide. The argument was the wife grabbed the gun and shot herself after an argument.
*   **Court's Reasoning:**
    *   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The Court found the prosecution's circumstantial evidence constituted an "unbroken chain" pointing to Appellant's guilt.
    *   **Credibility:** The Court affirmed the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, disbelieving the Appellant's version of events due to inconsistencies and improbabilities.
    *   **Bullet Trajectory:** The downward trajectory of the bullet was considered inconsistent with a self-inflicted wound, according to expert testimony.
    *   **Lack of Powder Nitrates:** The lack of powder nitrates on the victims hand was used as evidence it was not the victim who shot the gun.
    *   **Rejection of Suicide Theory:** The Court found the suicide defense to be implausible and unsupported by the evidence.
    *   **Affirmance of Lower Courts:** The Supreme Court deferred to the factual findings of the lower courts (RTC and CA), stating that the lower courts did not miss any pertinent details.

**Obligations:**

*   **Appellant:** Fulfillment of the parricide sentence.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant:** Criminal liability for parricide.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Factual Issues Final:** Because the Supreme Court affirmed the findings of fact of the lower courts, future avenues of appeal would face a very difficult task.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The conviction is heavily based on circumstantial evidence.
*   **Self-Defense/Accident Negated:** The defense's theories of self-defense or accidental shooting are explicitly rejected by the Court.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines and penalizes the crime of parricide.
*   **People v. Ayuman, G.R. No. 133436:** Cited regarding the elements of parricide.
*   **Ferrer v. People, G.R. No. 143487:** Cited regarding the weight given to trial court findings on witness credibility.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The absence of direct eyewitness testimony to the shooting presents a persistent underlying concern, though the court deemed the circumstantial evidence sufficient.

**Overall Assessment:** The appellant's conviction for parricide appears secure given the Supreme Court's affirmation of the lower courts' findings. A challenge on appeal would be difficult because the Supreme Court deferred to the factual findings of the lower courts.
