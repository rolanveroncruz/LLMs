## Legal Document Summary: *Angat v. Republic*, G.R. No. 175788

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision reversing the RTC's grant of a Petition for Reconstitution of TCT No. T-4399.

**Key Issue:** Propriety of the CA's reversal of the RTC decision granting the Petition for Reconstitution, specifically regarding jurisdictional requirements, proof of ownership, and the finality of judgment.

**Key Provisions and Analysis:**

*   **Finality of CA Decision:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirms the CA decision was final and executory because the Motion for Reconsideration was filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period. The SC notes that a registry receipt indicates a Melanie Angat received the notice, and that the petitionersâ€™ council of record could not be reached at their given address.
*   **Jurisdictional Requirements for Reconstitution (R.A. 26, Sec. 10, in relation to Sec. 9):** The SC clarifies that because the reconstitution petition was based on the owner's duplicate of TCT No. T-4399 (falling under Section 3(a) of R.A. 26), notice to adjoining property owners as mandated by Sections 12 and 13 of R.A. 26 is *not* a jurisdictional requirement. Publication and posting under Section 9 are sufficient. The court cites *Puzon v. Sta. Lucia Realty* (406 Phil. 263 (2001)) to support this point. *This corrects the CA's erroneous basis for reversing the RTC.*
*   **Proof of Ownership (Critical Deficiency):** The SC affirms that the petitioners failed to sufficiently demonstrate their ownership of the subject property at the time of the title's loss. The petitioners failed to provide any records prior to 1989, claiming that they had paid their taxes since 1955. In addition, the petitioners failed to trace the chain of transfers of the subject property from their grandfather to their father to the petitioners.
*   **Laches:** The SC notes that a 40-year delay in seeking reconstitution from the time of the fire, the SC notes, allowed the petitioners to act with laches. The court cites *Heirs of Eulalio Ragua v. Court of Appeals* to support this point.
*   **Land Registration Authority (LRA) Report:** The SC emphasizes that the LRA report, purportedly signed by Benjamin M. Bustos, was not the actual, genuine, official report of the LRA in this case, but rather the one dated 14 December 1999. This certification stated the technical description of the copy of TCT No. T-4399 was an open polygon.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Spurious LRA Report:** The court identified that the LRA report submitted by the petitioners was spurious and lacked the official signature of Atty. Benjamin M. Bustos, making it inadmissible in court.

**Conclusion:** The SC ultimately upholds the CA's dismissal of the Petition for Reconstitution, albeit partly correcting the CA's reasoning. The primary reason for dismissal is the petitioners' failure to adequately prove their ownership and right to the property at the time the title was lost, and their failure to act within a reasonable time. While the CA erred in requiring notice to adjoining property owners, the ultimate outcome remains correct based on the factual and evidentiary deficiencies. This case highlights the importance of proper documentation and timely action in land title reconstitution proceedings.
