**Case Summary: *People of the Philippines v. Nell Jackel Tuazon y Panlaqui***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 267946, May 27, 2024

**Issue:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC conviction of Nell Jackel Tuazon y Panlaqui for Qualified Trafficking under Section 6(a) of R.A. 9208, as amended by R.A. 10364, involving a 16-year-old victim, AAA.

**Holding:**  Supreme Court denied the appeal and affirmed the conviction with modification. Nell is guilty of qualified trafficking.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **R.A. 9208 (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003), as amended by R.A. 10364 (Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2012):** Defines "Trafficking in Persons" and criminalizes related acts.
    *   Section 3(a) defines trafficking to include receipt of a person with or without consent for the purpose of exploitation, including sexual exploitation.
    *   Section 4(a) enumerates specific acts constituting trafficking, including receiving a person for prostitution or sexual exploitation.
    *   Section 6(a) designates the crime as "qualified trafficking" when the victim is a child (under 18).
    *   Section 10(c) prescribes the penalty for qualified trafficking: life imprisonment and a fine of not less than PHP 2,000,000.00 but not more than PHP 5,000,000.00.
*   **Elements of Trafficking (People v. Casio):**
    1.  Act of recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without consent.
    2.  Means used (threat, force, coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power, taking advantage of vulnerability, giving/receiving payments).
    3.  Purpose (exploitation, prostitution, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, etc.).
*  The court held that no person can consent to exploitation, especially minors.

**Liabilities and Penalties:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Guilty of Qualified Trafficking under Section 6(a) of R.A. 9208, as amended.
    *   Sentence: Life imprisonment.
    *   Fine: PHP 2,000,000.00.
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   Moral damages to AAA: PHP 500,000.00.
    *   Exemplary damages to AAA: PHP 100,000.00.
    *   6% interest per annum on all damages from finality of the Decision.

**Key Facts:**

*   AAA, 16 years old, met Nell through "Mamu," an alleged sex peddler.
*   Nell paid Mamu PHP 5,000.00 to be with AAA.
*   AAA went to a hotel room with Nell where she alleges sexual assault.
*   AAA's testimony was corroborated by police officer testimony.

**Defense Arguments and Rebuttals:**

*   **Defense:** Lack of testimony from hotel crew, Mamu, and Lian undermined AAA's credibility. Hymenal lacerations indicated prior sexual activity, not Nell's actions.
*   **Court:** Corroborating testimonies of the arresting officer and the minor victim are sufficient for conviction (People v. Ramirez).  Sexual intercourse is not required for the consummation of trafficking (People v. Barrientos).  Credibility findings of the trial court are accorded respect.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Brozoto v. People:** Gravamen of the crime of trafficking is recruiting/using a human being for sexual exploitation.
*   **People v. Casio:** Elements of trafficking.
*   **People v. Ramirez:** Corroborating testimony sufficient to convict.
*   **People v. Spouses Yba√±ez, et al.:** Conviction based on surveillance of minor prostitution.
*   **People v. XXX and YYY:** Exploitation of minors is prohibited.
*   **People v. Barrientos:** Trafficking consummated even without sexual intercourse.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The conviction hinges heavily on AAA's testimony and circumstantial evidence, creating a potential argument for reasonable doubt despite corroborating testimony.
*   **Consent:** Though the Court emphasizes that consent is irrelevant in child trafficking, the initial interaction between AAA and Mamu could be subject to scrutiny regarding inducement and coercion. The defense may focus on the lack of immediate threat or force.
*   **Medico-legal Report:** While the court dismissed the defense's argument regarding prior sexual activity, the report's ambiguity might be exploited on appeal regarding the specific acts committed by the accused.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction for Qualified Trafficking. The focus is on the *act* of receiving and exploiting a minor for sexual purposes, regardless of whether actual intercourse occurred or initial consent was given. The key risk lies in the circumstantial nature of some evidence and the potential for further appeals focusing on reasonable doubt and the initial interaction between AAA and Mamu. The penalties are severe, including life imprisonment and substantial fines and damages.
