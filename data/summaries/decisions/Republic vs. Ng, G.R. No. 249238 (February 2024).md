Okay, here is a markdown summary of the provided legal document:

**Case:** *Republic of the Philippines v. Ruby Cuevas Ng a.k.a. Ruby Ng Sono* (G.R. No. 249238, February 27, 2024)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the RTC's grant of a Petition for Judicial Recognition of Foreign Divorce and Declaration of Capacity to Remarry Under Article 26 of the Family Code.

**Facts:**

*   Respondent, a Filipina, married a Japanese national in the Philippines in 2004.
*   They moved to Japan, then obtained a "divorce by mutual agreement" in Japan in 2007.
*   Respondent filed a petition in the Philippines to recognize the divorce and be declared capable of remarrying.
*   The RTC granted the petition, relying on Article 26(2) of the Family Code.
*   The Republic (through the OSG) appealed, arguing that:
    *   Divorce by agreement isn't recognizable; a court decision is needed.
    *   Respondent failed to properly prove Japanese divorce law.

**Issue:**

1.  Did the trial court err in recognizing a divorce obtained by mutual agreement, without adversarial proceedings?
2.  Did the respondent sufficiently prove the divorce decree and Japanese law on divorce?

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court *granted* the Republic's petition, reversing the RTC decision and remanding the case to the trial court.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Article 26(2) of the Family Code:**  The core of the dispute.  The Court acknowledges *Republic v. Manalo* and subsequent cases establishing that Article 26(2) applies even if the Filipino spouse initiated the divorce or if it was a joint/mutual effort.
*   The main issue is that although prior cases established the judicial recognition of divorces obtained by mutual agreement, the Supreme Court held that in this case, while respondent was able to sufficiently prove the existence of the divorce decree, she failed to sufficiently prove the applicable law on divorce in Japan, as the photocopy of the pertinent portions of the Japanese Civil Code was not properly authenticated.
*   However, instead of dismissing the petition, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the trial court for presentation of the pertinent Japanese law on divorce.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Respondent in RTC):**  Obligated to properly prove both the fact of divorce and the foreign law allowing it, per the Rules of Evidence.  Failed on the latter point, necessitating remand.
*   **Philippine Courts:** Duty to uphold Article 26(2) in light of established jurisprudence, but also bound to apply evidentiary rules regarding proof of foreign law.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Republic v. Manalo (2018):*** Landmark case holding that Article 26(2) applies regardless of who initiated the divorce.
*   ***Van Dorn v. Romillo (1985):*** Foundational case establishing that a foreign divorce, valid under the alien spouse's national law, may be recognized in the Philippines to protect the Filipino spouse.
*   ***Minoru Fujiki v. Marinay (2013):*** Discussed nature of Article 26, paragraph 2 of the Family Code.
*   ***Galapon v. Republic (2020) and Republic v. Bayog-Saito (2022):*** Reinforce the applicability of Article 26(2) to divorces obtained *jointly* by the Filipino and foreign spouse.
*   ***Racho v. Seiichi Tanaka (2018) and Basa-Egami v. Bersales (2022):*** Illustrates cases where the Supreme Court upheld the validity of divorces obtained by mutual agreement.
*   ***Corpuz v. Sto. Tomas (2010) and Garcia v. Recio (2001):*** Emphasize the need to prove fact of divorce and governing foreign law.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 26, Family Code of the Philippines:** Crucial provision allowing recognition of foreign divorce.
*   **Article 15, Civil Code of the Philippines:** Regarding laws governing family rights following citizens even when abroad.
*   **Rule 132, Sections 24 & 25 of the Revised Rules on Evidence:** Specifies requirements for proving official records, including foreign laws.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses and Arguments Raised:**

*   **Interpretation of "validly obtained":**  The Republic argued that "validly obtained" requires a *judicial* divorce; the Court rejects this, citing the plain language of the statute.
*   The dissenting opinions suggest the Supreme Court decisions in *Racho, Bersales, and Bayog-Saito* are inconsistent with the public policy on marriages as they recognized divorce decrees obtained extrajudicially.

**Potential Risks & Concerns:**

*   **Failure to Prove Foreign Law on Remand:**  If respondent fails to properly prove Japanese divorce law on remand, the petition will ultimately be denied.
*   **Public Policy Concerns (Dissenting Opinions):**  Arguments from the dissenting justices regarding the policy against absolute divorce and potential circumvention of Philippine law raise concerns about the expansion of Article 26(2)'s scope.
*   **Amendments to Divorce Recognition Process:** The Justices raised the point that the Court may examine its rules on recognition of foreign divorce with the goal of providing a more streamlined and economical procedure

**Notes:**

*   The Court leans heavily on the principle of *stare decisis* regarding the applicability of Article 26(2) to divorces obtained through mutual agreement. However, it strictly applies the rules of evidence regarding proof of foreign law.
*   Several Justices wrote concurring or dissenting opinions.
*   The Justices discussed but ultimately decided against taking judicial notice of the Office of the Court Administrator Circular regarding foreign divorce laws
