## Legal Document Summary - People v. Versoza & Avendaño, G.R. No. 118944

**Document Type:** Decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines.

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court (SC) reviewed a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision finding Romulo Versoza and Jerry Avendaño guilty of highway robbery with homicide under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 532. The SC *modified* the RTC decision, convicting them of *robbery with homicide* under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) instead.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Original Charge:** Highway Robbery with Homicide (PD 532).
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of Highway Robbery with Homicide (PD 532). Sentence: Life Imprisonment, plus civil indemnity (P50,000), interment expenses (P70,000), and moral damages (P100,000).
*   **SC Ruling:** Guilty of Robbery with Homicide (Art. 294(1), RPC). Sentence: *Reclusion Perpetua*, plus joint and several liability for civil indemnity, interment expenses, and moral damages as per RTC.
*   **Eyewitness Identification:** The SC upheld the RTC's reliance on the positive identification by eyewitness Arthur Dojenas. The Court applied the "totality of circumstances" test from *People v. Teehankee, 249 SCRA 54 (1995)*, finding the identification reliable.
*   **Alibi:** The SC rejected the alibis of both defendants as unsubstantiated and insufficient to overcome the positive identification.
*   **Conspiracy:** The SC found sufficient evidence of conspiracy, based on the coordinated actions of Versoza and Avendaño during the robbery and homicide.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Both Versoza and Avendaño are criminally liable as principals for the crime of robbery with homicide.
*   **Civil Liability:** They are jointly and severally liable for:
    *   P50,000 Civil Indemnity
    *   P70,000 Interment and Burial Expenses
    *   P100,000 Moral Damages

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Misidentification Claim (Avendaño):** Avendaño argued misidentification due to discrepancy between his real name ("Cherry Abendaño y Pagatpat") and the name in the information ("Jerry Avendaño y Mendoza"). The SC rejected this, holding that positive identification can be based on physical features, not solely on the name. Importantly, the defense failed to raise this issue at trial.
*   **Erroneous Charge (PD 532 vs. Art. 294(1)):** The SC found the original charge of Highway Robbery with Homicide (PD 532) to be erroneous. The act did not constitute indiscriminate highway robbery.  However, the information adequately described *robbery with homicide* which allowed the SC to convict for the appropriate offense, using the principle that the description of the offense, not the designation, controls.
*   **Lack of Indiscriminate Targetting:** The key factor in switching from PD 532 to Art 294(1) of RPC.
*   **Lack of independent evidence on alibis**: Avendaño failed to produce independent evidence like documents or witnesses to support his Alibi.
**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 532 (Anti-Piracy and Anti-Highway Robbery Law of 1974):**  Incorrectly applied by the RTC; SC differentiated between highway robbery (indiscriminate targeting) and robbery with homicide (specific victim). Cited *People v. Puno, 219 SCRA 85 (1993)* regarding the intent of PD 532. Cited *People v. Mendoza, 324 Phil. 273, 292 (1996).* on element of indiscriminateness.
*   **Revised Penal Code (Art. 294(1)):** The applicable law for robbery with homicide.
*   **People v. Teehankee, 249 SCRA 54 (1995):** Used to analyze reliability of eyewitness identification.
*   **Art. 63 (2) RPC:** In the absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances in crimes in which the law prescribes a penalty composed of two indivisible penalties, the lesser penalty shall be applied.

**Analysis for Lawyer:**

The primary legal issue revolved around the proper classification of the crime. The SC correctly rectified the misapplication of PD 532. The eyewitness identification appears solid under the *Teehankee* test.  The defense's challenge to Avendaño's identification based on a name discrepancy was weak, especially given the failure to object at trial, per *People v. Java, 227 SCRA 668 (1993)*. The finding of conspiracy is supported by the coordinated actions of the appellants during the commission of the crime, and the application of Art. 294(1) of RPC is thus legally correct.
