## Legal Document Summary: Gloria v. Builders Savings

**Document:** G.R. No. 202324, June 04, 2018 (832 Phil. 64)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA Decision reversing RTC Order which declared a real estate mortgage and promissory note null and void.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Conchita Gloria and Maria Lourdes Gloria-Payduan (mother and daughter).
*   **Respondent:** Builders Savings and Loan Association, Inc.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Property:** Land in Kamuning, Quezon City, covered by TCT 35814, owned by Spouses Juan and Conchita Gloria. Juan is deceased.
*   **Fraudulent Mortgage:** Benildo Biag allegedly tricked Conchita into surrendering the title under false pretenses (reconstitution), then mortgaged the property to Builders Savings. Conchita claims she was fraudulently induced into signing mortgage documents under the belief they were for title reconstitution. Juan's signature was forged on the mortgage documents post-mortem.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Initially dismissed the case, but on reconsideration, declared the mortgage and promissory note null and void due to mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence, or fraud (Article 1330, Civil Code), and Builders Savings' lack of due diligence (Gatioan vs. Gaffud, Rural Bank of Caloocan City vs. CA).  RTC ordered cancellation of encumbrances, return of title, and damages to the Plaintiffs based on negligence and deceit. Cited Article 2085 of the Civil Code re: mortgagor's free disposal of property.
*   **CA Ruling:** Reversed the RTC, dismissing the complaint based on procedural grounds:
    *   **Real Party in Interest:** Maria Lourdes was not a real party in interest because her inheritance rights from her deceased father, Juan, had not been formally established in a special proceeding.
    *   **Defective Verification:** The Second Amended Complaint had a defective verification because Conchita did not sign it.
    *   **Hearsay Evidence:**  Maria Lourdes's testimony about the fraud was deemed hearsay because it was based on what Conchita told her.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Granted the Petition, reinstated the RTC Order.  The Supreme Court held that Maria Lourdes had proven her filiation and therefore had an interest in the property as an heir. Also, a prior declaration of heirship is not necessary for heirs to assert rights (Capablanca v. Bas, Heirs of Ignacio Conti v. Court of Appeals, Quison v. Salud). The failure of one co-owner to sign the verification and certification against forum shopping is not fatal (Iglesia Ni Cristo v. Judge Ponferrada, Heirs of Renato L. Delfino, Sr. (Deceased) v. Anasao). The mortgage and promissory note were simulated and therefore void (Articles 1346 & 1409, Civil Code, Spouses Solivel v. Judge Francisco). The lender failed to perform proper due diligence in ascertaining the validity of the signatures on the loan documents.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Builders Savings:** Obligated to return the TCT free of encumbrances. Liable for moral damages and attorney's fees based on negligence.
*   **Conchita & Lourdes:** Obligation to prove their claims of fraud and undue influence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Fraud Allegations:** The central issue is the validity of the mortgage, hinging on whether Conchita signed the documents voluntarily and knowingly. The strength of the evidence surrounding the alleged fraud and forgery is crucial.
*   **Due Diligence of Builders Savings:**  The core argument against Builders Savings lies in its failure to adequately investigate the loan application, including the identity and capacity of the mortgagor.  Case law (Bank of Commerce v. Spouses San Pablo, Sr.) emphasizes the lender's duty of care, which the SC found lacking.
*   **Procedural Issues:**  The CA's focus on procedural deficiencies (real party in interest, defective verification) initially posed a significant risk, but the Supreme Court ultimately addressed these concerns.
*   **Statutory References:** The ruling relies heavily on the Civil Code (Articles 777, 494, 1330, 1346, 1409, 2085, 2217, 2219) and Rules of Court (Rule 3, Sections 4 & 5, Rule 7).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Gatioan vs. Gaffud:** Lenders must carefully examine title and conduct physical investigation.
*   **Rural Bank of Caloocan City vs. CA:** Deceit by a third party resulting in mutual error can invalidate a contract.
*   **De Lara vs. Ayroso, Parqui vs. PNB:** A mortgage by a forger is void.
*   **Quison v. Salud:** No prior settlement of estate is needed for heirs to commence action originally pertaining to deceased.
*   **Capablanca v. Bas:** No judicial declaration of heirship is necessary.
*   **Iglesia Ni Cristo v. Judge Ponferrada:** Substantial compliance with verification and certification requirements.
*   **Spouses Solivel v. Judge Francisco, Joaquin vs. Madrid:** Mortgage executed by an impostor or through forgery is a nullity.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Poblete:** Mortgagor must be absolute owner of the property to be mortgaged.
*   **Bank of Commerce v. Spouses San Pablo, Sr.:** Duty to investigate authority of mortgagor.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court prioritizes the substantive issues of fraud and forgery over procedural technicalities. The ruling reinforces the principle that a forged mortgage is void and emphasizes the responsibility of financial institutions to conduct thorough due diligence when granting loans secured by real property. The case clarifies that heirs can bring actions related to inherited property without prior judicial declaration of heirship, easing procedural hurdles for asserting their rights.
