## Legal Document Summary: Carlos v. Sandoval, G.R. No. 179922

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding an action for declaration of nullity of marriage, status of a child, recovery of property, reconveyance, sum of money, and damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Declaration of Nullity:** Emphasizes the principle that grounds for declaration of absolute nullity of marriage must be proven through trial. Specifically prohibits judgments on the pleadings, summary judgments, or confession of judgment in such cases (Section 17, Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages, A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC).
*   **Standing to Sue:**  Under A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC, only the husband or wife can file a petition for declaration of absolute nullity of a marriage governed by the Family Code.  However, this rule is *prospective* and does not apply to cases commenced before March 15, 2003.
*   **Marriages Under the Civil Code:** For marriages solemnized under the Civil Code (like the one in this case, May 14, 1962), the Civil Code is silent as to who may bring an action to declare the marriage void. The Court holds that such a person must be a "real party-in-interest" with a material interest that would be affected by the judgment, citing *Amor-Catalan v. Court of Appeals*.
*   **Successional Rights:** Brother doesn't have compulsory heir rights, but collateral relatives have rights. Collateral relatives (brothers and sisters) can inherit in the absence of descendants, ascendants, illegitimate children, or a surviving spouse (Art. 1003, New Civil Code). *Gonzales v. CA*
*   **Filiation:**  Reiterates the importance of proper determination of a child's filiation. Invalidates RTC ruling that assumed no parentage.
*   **Role of the State:** Highlights the critical role of the public prosecutor/Solicitor General in intervening to prevent fabrication or suppression of evidence in nullity cases, referencing *Republic v. Cuison-Melgar*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Parties:** Petitioner Juan De Dios Carlos has the burden to prove both the nullity of the marriage and, critically, that he is a real party-in-interest.
*   **RTC:** Instructed to conduct a full trial on the merits. If Teofilo II is proven to be the legitimate, illegitimate, or legally adopted son of the deceased, the RTC MUST dismiss the nullity action for lack of standing.
*   **State:** The public prosecutor has an obligation to intervene to protect the integrity of the proceedings.
* **CA:** Should not give respondent's declaration on illegitimacy credence in line with Article 167 of the Family Code.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Standing:**  The most significant risk for the petitioner is the potential lack of standing. His success hinges on proving that Teofilo II is *not* a child of the deceased.
*   **Proof of Nullity:**  The petitioner must present sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of validity of marriage and rebut the Justice of the Peace's affidavit.
*   **Conflicting Testimony:** The inconsistent statements by the respondent regarding the child's filiation present evidentiary challenges.  Article 167 limits value of mother's statements against legitimacy.
*   **Property Disputes:**  The outcome of the nullity determination directly impacts the property claims.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code:** A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC (Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity), Art. 167
*   **Civil Code:**  Articles 88, 101, 887, 1001, 1003
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 19 (Judgment on Pleadings), Rule 35 (Summary Judgment)
*   **Relevant Cases:** *Republic v. Sandiganbayan*, *Republic v. Cuison-Melgar*, *Enrico v. Heirs of Sps. Medinaceli*, *Amor-Catalan v. Court of Appeals*, *Gonzales v. Court of Appeals*

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court has ruled that the CA was correct to reverse the RTC's summary judgment. The case is remanded to the RTC for a full trial on the merits. A critical issue to be determined is if the petitioner has standing to bring a nullity of marriage case. Therefore the initial inquiry should be on the Filiation of Teofilo II, as well as the validity of the disputed marriage based on evidence, not pleadings or summary judgment. The validity of property disposition hinged upon the marital status.
