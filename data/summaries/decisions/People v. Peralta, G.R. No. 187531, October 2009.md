**Legal Document Summary: People v. Peralta y Hidalgo, G.R. No. 187531 (2009)**

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming the conviction of Elmer Peralta y Hidalgo for qualified statutory rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime:** Qualified Statutory Rape.  The Court affirmed the lower courts' findings that the accused committed sexual intercourse with a child under 12 years of age, which is statutory rape under the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The victim being under 7 years old qualified the rape.
*   **Elements:** The decision reiterated the elements of statutory rape: (1) carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) the woman was below 12 years of age. Evidence of the victim's age (birth certificate) and testimony regarding the act of intercourse were presented.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua without eligibility for parole, imposed due to Republic Act No. 9346 (prohibiting the death penalty).
*   **Damages:** Modified from the RTC decision, the appellant was ordered to pay:
    *   Civil Indemnity: P75,000.00
    *   Moral Damages: P75,000.00
    *   Exemplary Damages: P30,000.00

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant (Elmer Peralta y Hidalgo):** Obligation to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and to pay the damages awarded.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Appeal:** While this is a Supreme Court decision, the possibility of a motion for reconsideration (though unlikely to succeed based on the unanimous findings) could be considered for further review.
*   **Enforcement:** The effective enforcement of the sentence and the collection of damages from the appellant may present practical challenges.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines statutory rape and its elements.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, leading to the imposition of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **People v. Glivano, G.R. No. 177565 (2008):** Reaffirmed principles in rape cases concerning the ease of accusation, the need for careful scrutiny of the complainant's testimony, and the need for the prosecution's evidence to stand on its own merit.
*   **People of the Philippines v. Adelado Anguac y Ragadao, G.R. No. 176744, June 5, 2009:** Provided basis for the modified damages.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   None explicitly stated in the summary given the affirmation by the Court.

**Overall Assessment:**

The decision appears well-supported by evidence, particularly the victim's testimony and the medical findings. The Supreme Court upheld the trial court and Court of Appeals decisions, establishing a firm legal precedent. The potential risks are minimal, focusing primarily on enforcement.
