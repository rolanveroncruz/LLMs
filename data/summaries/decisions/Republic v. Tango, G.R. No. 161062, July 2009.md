**Legal Document Summary: *Republic of the Philippines vs. Ferventino U. Tango***

**Case:** G.R. No. 161062, July 31, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of CA Decision affirming RTC Order declaring Maria Jose Villarba, wife of Respondent, presumptively dead under Article 41 of the Family Code.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 41 of the Family Code:** Allows a spouse to remarry if the prior spouse has been absent for four years with a well-founded belief that the absent spouse is dead. Requires a summary proceeding for declaration of presumptive death.
*   **Article 238 & 253 of Family Code:** Establishes summary judicial proceedings, including those under Art. 41.
*   **Article 247 of the Family Code:** Provides that the judgment of the court in a summary proceeding shall be immediately final and executory.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code, Articles 41, 238, 247, 253:** Govern the declaration of presumptive death and the nature of proceedings.
*   **Civil Code, Article 391:** Referenced within Article 41 of the Family Code regarding exceptions for circumstances of danger of death, reducing the absence requirement to two years.
*   **Doctrine of Hierarchy of Courts:** (Citing *Flaminiano v. Adriano*) Determines the proper court for filing petitions for certiorari.
*   **Finality of Judgments:** (Citing *Heirs of Maura So v. Obliosca*) A final decision is immutable and unalterable, with limited exceptions (clerical errors, *nunc pro tunc* entries, void judgments, subsequent circumstances).
* Republic v. Bermudez-Lorino

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Error (Republic):** Filing a Notice of Appeal instead of a Petition for Certiorari in the Court of Appeals, as the RTC's judgment in a summary proceeding under Article 41 is immediately final and executory per Article 247 of the Family Code. This is a jurisdictional defect.
*   **Finality of Judgment:** The RTC's order declaring presumptive death had become final and executory due to the procedural errors, making it immutable despite any potential errors in the lower courts.
*   **Hearsay Evidence (Republic's Argument):** The OSG argued that the respondent's testimony regarding the search efforts made by friends and relatives was inadmissible hearsay.
*   **Insufficient Evidence of "Well-Founded Belief" (Republic's Argument):** The OSG contended that even if admitted, the evidence presented was insufficient to establish a "well-founded belief" in the wife's death.
*   **Potential for Bigamy:** Remarrying without a valid declaration of presumptive death, or based on an erroneously obtained declaration.
*   **Reappearance of Absent Spouse:** The potential for the absent spouse (Maria) to reappear, which has implications for any subsequent marriage contracted by Ferventino.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "well-founded belief" standard in Article 41. What constitutes sufficient due diligence to support this belief is fact-specific and open to interpretation. This was the core dispute between the parties. However, the court did not make a determination on this point.
*   The court mentions Respondent's intent to withdraw and lack of participation as reasons to rule against him; However, the court does not do so and rules in his favor.
