**Legal Document Summary: *Po v. Dampal*, G.R. No. 173329 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** This case involves a tenant (Dampal) exercising his right of legal redemption over agricultural land that was foreclosed and subsequently sold to petitioners (Po and Mutia). The central legal issue is whether the tenant's right to redeem had prescribed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Right of Redemption (Sec. 12, R.A. No. 3844, as amended by R.A. No. 6389):** This statute grants agricultural lessees the right to redeem land sold to a third party without their knowledge within 180 days from *written notice* served by the vendee (buyer) and the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) upon registration of the sale. Priority over other rights of redemption is established.
*   **Notice Requirement:** The *written notice* to the tenant and the DAR upon registration of the sale is a mandatory condition precedent to trigger the 180-day redemption period.
*   **DARAB Jurisdiction:** The Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) has primary jurisdiction over agrarian disputes, including those involving the redemption of agricultural land.

**Procedural History:**

*   Mortgage and Foreclosure: Spouses Causin mortgaged agricultural land to Rural Bank of Tagoloan, Inc. Foreclosure occurred due to non-payment.
*   Purchase by Po: Susan Po purchased the land at public auction. Titles were issued in her name (TCT No. T-39280 and TCT No. 39281).
*   Sale to Mutia: Po sold a portion of the land to Lilia Mutia (TCT No. T-40193).
*   RTC Action (Civil Case No. 94-280): Spouses Causin and Dampal filed a complaint in the RTC against the bank for annulment of the mortgage and sale.
*   DARAB Action (DARAB Case No. X-05-361): Dampal subsequently filed a complaint against Po and Mutia with the DARAB for legal redemption with preliminary mandatory injunction.
*   DARAB Decision: Initially dismissed by the Regional Adjudicator based on prescription but reversed by the DARAB Central Office, which upheld Dampal's right to redeem.
*   Appellate Court Proceedings: Petitioners erroneously appealed the DARAB decision to the Court of Appeals via a petition for certiorari (Rule 65) instead of a petition for review (Rule 43). The CA dismissed for improper remedy and being filed out of time.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Invalid Transfer:** Failure to provide proper notice to Dampal and the DAR renders the transfer potentially voidable.
*   **Redemption Liability:** Petitioners are obligated to allow redemption by Dampal at the price of P40,000 plus interest if the DARAB decision is upheld.
*   **Title Cancellation:** The DARAB decision orders the cancellation of the titles issued to Po and Mutia and the issuance of new titles in Dampal's favor upon payment of the redemption amount.
*   **Tenancy Rights:** The DARAB confirmed Dampal's security of tenure as a tenant.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code), as amended by R.A. No. 6389 (Code of Agrarian Reforms):** Governs the tenant's right of redemption and the mandatory notice requirements (Sec. 12).
*   **Rule 43 of the Rules of Court:** Governs appeals from quasi-judicial agencies like the DARAB to the Court of Appeals.
*   **DARAB Rules of Procedure:** Sets forth the procedural rules governing cases before the DARAB.
*   *Hanjin Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 165910 (2006): Outlines exceptions where a petition for certiorari may be allowed despite being the wrong remedy.
*   *Audi AG v. Mejia*, G.R. No. 167533 (2007): Emphasizes the importance of adhering to procedural rules.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Sufficiency of Notice:** The central contentious issue is whether Dampal had sufficient notice of the sale to trigger the prescriptive period, even without *written notice* as required by the statute. The petitioners argued Dampal had constructive knowledge due to the pending RTC case. However, the court strictly construed the *written notice* requirement.
*   **Procedural Error:** The incorrect choice of remedy (certiorari instead of petition for review) was fatal to the petitioner's case. Reliance on an incorrect interpretation of DARAB rules was deemed inexcusable.

**Potential Strategies/Next Steps:**

*   A motion for reconsideration before the Supreme Court could be considered, however given the stringent requirements it is unlikely to be granted.
*   Comply with the DARAB decision and facilitate redemption, while preserving claims for reimbursement from the original mortgagor (Spouses Causin).
*   Evaluate the possibility of a separate action against the Rural Bank of Tagoloan, Inc. for failure to ensure compliance with notice requirements during the foreclosure proceedings.
