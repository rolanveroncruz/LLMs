**Case Summary: *People v. Mijares*, G.R. No. 126042 (1998)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting the accused, Isidro Mijares, of murder for the death of a six-year-old girl, Marissa Agujar.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the RTC decision, acquitting Mijares due to reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Crime Charged:** Murder under the Revised Penal Code. The Information alleged treachery and abuse of superior strength.
*   **Prosecution's Case:** Relied on circumstantial evidence to link Mijares to the crime.
    *   Mijares was known to the victim and her family.
    *   He had a prior dispute with the victim's stepfather.
    *   He was the last person seen with the victim.
    *   Slippers belonging to a friend of Mijares, borrowed by him, were found near the victim's body at the crime scene.
    *   Mijares allegedly changed his behavior (not returning to his lodging, fleeing to Cagayan de Tawi-Tawi) after the victim's disappearance.
*   **Defense's Case:** Alibi. Mijares claimed he was sleeping at a friend's house on the night of the murder and denied involvement.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Convicted Mijares based on circumstantial evidence, finding treachery.

**Reasoning for Reversal:**

*   **Sufficiency of Circumstantial Evidence (Sec. 4, Rule 133, Rules of Court):** While the prosecution presented circumstantial evidence, the Supreme Court found that it did not meet the threshold of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The circumstances were subject to multiple interpretations, some consistent with innocence.
*   **"Last Seen" and Slippers:** The Court held that being the last person seen with the victim did not establish he committed the murder.  The slippers found at the crime scene also did not conclusively prove guilt, as their presence could be explained by alternative scenarios (e.g., someone else placing them there to frame Mijares).
*   **Flight:**  Mijares' departure to Cagayan de Tawi-Tawi was not conclusive evidence of guilt, as he was not a resident of the city and may have had legitimate reasons to leave.
*   **Motive:** The Court deemed the alleged motives (prior quarrel, being asked to leave the victim's home months prior) insufficient to incite the murder.
*   **Presumption of Innocence:** Citing constitutional principles, the Court emphasized the presumption of innocence and the need to resolve any doubt in favor of the accused.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Sec. 4, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court:** Defines the standard for conviction based on circumstantial evidence.
*   ***People v. Ragon*, G.R. No. 100593 (1997)** and ***People v. Binamira*, 277 SCRA 232 (1997):** Cited as analogous cases where convictions based on similar circumstantial evidence were overturned.
*   ***People v. Llaguno*, G.R. No. 91262 (1998):** Stated that where a prosecution's case depends on circumstantial evidence, the circumstances must be consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with their innocence.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of Circumstantial Evidence:**  The crux of the case rests on how the circumstantial evidence is interpreted. The dissenting opinion argues strongly that the evidence, when taken as a whole, demonstrates guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This highlights the inherent subjectivity in evaluating circumstantial evidence.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court acquitted Mijares due to the failure of the prosecution to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court emphasized that circumstantial evidence must form an unbroken chain leading to the single conclusion that the accused is guilty, excluding all other reasonable possibilities. The "last seen" doctrine and the presence of the slippers were insufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence.
