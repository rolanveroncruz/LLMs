## Legal Document Summary: DAR v. Carriedo (G.R. No. 176549)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration.

**Core Issue:** Whether the prior sale of landholdings by Carriedo to PLFI, without DAR clearance, constitutes an exercise of his retention rights, precluding him from claiming the subject landholding as his retained area. This hinges on the validity of Item No. 4 of DAR Administrative Order (AO) No. 05-06 and the indefeasibility of Certificates of Land Ownership Awards (CLOAs).

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **DAR Administrative Order No. 05-06, Item No. 4:** This provision states that when a sale involves more than the 5-hectare retention area, the first 5 hectares sold without DAR clearance are considered the landowner's retained area under the principle of estoppel.
    *   **DAR's Argument:** AO 05-06 is valid and serves to prevent landowners from circumventing CARP by selling land without clearance and later claiming retention rights on remaining land.
    *   Prior sale of land without DAR clearance constitutes exercise of right to retention.

*   **Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL, RA 6657):**
    *   **Section 6:** Establishes retention limits.  DAR argues that Carriedo's prior illegal sale exceeded the retention limit.
    *   **Section 70:** Deals with disposition of retained lands. DAR argues first five hectares are valid and constitutes the land owners right to retention.
    *   **Section 24:** Deals with award to beneficiaries. Rights commence from receipt of registered CLOA, which are indefeasible after 1 year from registration.
    *   **Section 49:** Empowers DAR to issue substantive and procedural rules for CARP implementation.

*   **CLOA Indefeasibility:** The DAR argues that CLOAs, like Torrens titles, are indefeasible one year after registration, aligning with Section 24 of CARL, as amended by RA 9700, and jurisprudence like *Estribillo v. DAR*.

**Obligations:**

*   Landowners are obligated to comply with retention limits and obtain DAR clearance for sales of agricultural land.
*   Landowners are obligated to exercise their right to retention in good faith, without circumventing the intent of CARP.

**Liabilities:**

*   Sale of land without DAR clearance violates CARP and may render the sale void.
*   Landowners who previously sold land without DAR clearance may be estopped from claiming subsequent land as their retained area.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Retroactive Application of AO 05-06:** The resolution potentially applies AO 05-06 retroactively, impacting sales that occurred before its issuance. This could lead to challenges based on lack of fair notice.
*   **Ambiguity in Defining "Sale":** The definition of "sale" is crucial. Does it include other forms of disposition like mortgages or long-term leases?
*   **Circumvention of CARP:** The DAR argues that landowners are attempting to circumvent CARP. This can lead to claims of bad faith and ultimately the disallowance of land retention.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Delfino, Sr. v. Anasao***:  This case supports the principle that a landowner cannot enjoy the proceeds of a sale and simultaneously exercise retention rights under CARP. It justifies the DAR's inclusion of previously sold land in the retention area calculation.
*   ***Estribillo v. DAR***: Affirms that CLOAs are enrolled in the Torrens system and are as indefeasible as certificates of title.
*   ***Chamber of Real Estate and Builders' Associations, Inc. v. Romulo***:  Emphasizes judicial deference to administrative rules and regulations formulated by agencies with expertise.
*   ***Rom v. Roxas & Company, Inc.***: Supports the position that the DAR is the government agency legally mandated to implement the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988 and the primary agency vested with the expertise on the technicalities of the CARL.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law)**
*   **RA 9700 (Strengthening the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program)**
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree)**

**Conclusion:**

This Supreme Court Resolution reverses its prior decision and upholds the validity of Item No. 4 of DAR AO 05-06.  It treats prior sales of agricultural land without DAR clearance as an exercise of retention rights, potentially precluding landowners from claiming other lands as retained areas. It also reaffirms the indefeasibility of CLOAs after one year from registration. However, the resolution's impact on pre-AO 05-06 sales and the definition of "sale" may present future legal challenges.
