Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *The City Government of Baguio vs. Atty. Brain Masweng, et al.*, G.R. No. 195905, July 4, 2018 (835 Phil. 501)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari, appealing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that upheld the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples-Cordillera Administrative Region's (NCIP-CAR) issuance of Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs) and Writs of Preliminary Injunction in NCIP Case Nos. 29-CAR-09 and 31-CAR-09.

**Key Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** City Government of Baguio (represented by various officials).
*   **Respondents:** Atty. Brain Masweng (NCIP-CAR Hearing Officer), and various individuals claiming ancestral land rights within the Busol Forest Reserve.

**Background:**

Private respondents filed petitions with the NCIP-CAR seeking: (1) identification, delineation, and recognition of their ancestral lands in the Busol Forest Reserve and issuance of Certificates of Ancestral Land Title (CALT), and (2) to restrain the City Government of Baguio from enforcing demolition orders pending the ancestral land application. The NCIP-CAR, through Atty. Masweng, issued TROs and preliminary injunctions against the City Government.

**CA Ruling:** The CA dismissed the City Government's petition for certiorari, citing procedural defects (failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration before the NCIP) and forum shopping (due to a pending motion to dismiss before the NCIP). The CA also held that the NCIP had the power to issue the injunctive relief and didn't gravely abuse its discretion.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Mootness:** The Supreme Court (SC) acknowledged the case was technically moot because prior SC decisions had already set aside the TROs/injunctions issued by Atty. Masweng in related cases *City Government of Baguio v. Atty. Masweng* 727 Phil. 540 (2014), after he was found guilty of indirect contempt. However, it chose to rule on the merits due to paramount public interest (preservation of the Busol Water Reserve) and the likelihood of repetition of the issues.
*   **Procedural Issues:** The SC found the CA erred in dismissing the Petition for Certiorari. It held that exceptions to the Motion for Reconsideration requirement existed because the issues had been raised before the NCIP, there was urgency, and the case involved public interest. It also held that the Petition did not amount to forum shopping because the relief sought were different.
*   **Merits:** The SC reversed the CA, holding that the TROs and Preliminary Injunctions were improperly issued because the private respondents failed to demonstrate a clear and unmistakable legal right to the land.
    *   The claimants' rights over the land in the Busol Forest Reserve were not unequivocal because they admited their land claims were still pending before the NCIP.
    *   The SC emphasized that pending land claims do not constitute the clear legal right necessary for injunctive relief. The city government's interest in preserving the forest outweigh the private interests.
*   **Stare Decisis:** The SC invoked the doctrine of *stare decisis*. The cases of *City Government of Baguio v. Atty. Masweng*, 597 Phil. 668 (2009) and *The Baguio Regreening Movement, Inc. v. Masweng*, 705 Phil. 103 (2013) had already established that Proclamation No. 15, often cited by claimants in the Busol Forest Reserve, does not constitute a definitive recognition of ancestral land rights. The Court ruled that the injunction was without basis because the applicants failed to establish a clear and legal right.
*   **Outcome:** The SC granted the petition and set aside the TROs and Preliminary Injunctions issued by the NCIP-CAR. The SC stressed that the denial of injunctive relief does not preclude the claimants from pursuing their ancestral land claims in the proper forum.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Requirements for Preliminary Injunction:**  The SC reiterated the requirements for issuing a preliminary injunction: (1) material and substantial invasion of a right; (2) clear and unmistakable right of the complainant; (3) urgent and paramount necessity to prevent serious damage.
*   **Protection of Watersheds:** The decision underscores the importance of preserving watershed areas, citing *Province of Rizal v. Executive Secretary* and related cases.
*   **Application of IPRA:** The decision clarifies that Baguio City is not automatically exempt from the IPRA because the law concedes the validity of prior land rights recognised or acquired through any process before its effectivity.
*   **Applicability of Proclamation No. 15:** The decision re-iterates that Proclamation No. 15 does not constitute a definitive recognition of ancestral land claims.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ongoing Land Claims:** The private respondents' ancestral land claims remain pending, meaning future litigation is possible.
*   **Balancing of Interests:** The case highlights the tension between the rights of indigenous peoples and the government's interest in protecting the environment.
*   **Interpretation of "Clear Legal Right":** The standard for establishing a "clear legal right" in the context of ancestral land claims can be subject to interpretation and further litigation.
