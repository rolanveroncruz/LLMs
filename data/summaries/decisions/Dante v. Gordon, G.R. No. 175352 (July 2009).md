## Legal Document Summary: *Liban v. Gordon*, G.R. No. 175352 (2009)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision.

**Key Issue:** Whether Senator Richard Gordon forfeited his Senate seat by simultaneously serving as Chairman of the Philippine National Red Cross (PNRC) Board of Governors, violating Section 13, Article VI of the Constitution which prohibits Senators from holding other government offices, including government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs), during their term.

**Ruling:** Petition denied. The Court held that the office of PNRC Chairman is *not* a government office or an office in a GOCC.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Petitioners' Argument:** The PNRC is a GOCC based on *Camporedondo v. NLRC* and that Senator Gordon's acceptance of the PNRC chairmanship resulted in automatic forfeiture of his Senate seat, citing *Flores v. Drilon*.
*   **Respondent's Argument:**
    *   Petitioners lack standing to file quo warranto or taxpayer's suit.
    *   PNRC is not a GOCC, and volunteer service to the PNRC is neither an "office" nor "employment."
*   **Court's Rationale:**
    *   **Standing:** The Court characterized the petition as *quo warranto*, requiring the petitioner to claim entitlement to the office, which the petitioners did not. Even if treated as a taxpayer's suit, the petition fails on the merits.
    *   **PNRC Status:** PNRC is a private organization performing public functions. It adheres to the Geneva Conventions as a non-profit, donor-funded humanitarian organization.  Its autonomy, neutrality, and independence are crucial for acceptance by all parties in armed conflicts.
    *   **Government Control:** The government does not own or control the PNRC. It receives no appropriations from Congress and is financed primarily by private contributions.  Only six out of thirty members of the PNRC Board of Governors are appointed by the President.  The President cannot revise or reverse the decisions of the PNRC Board.
    *   **Definition of GOCC:** Cites Section 2(13) of the Administrative Code of 1987, defining a GOCC as an agency owned by the government to the extent of at least 51% of its capital stock. The PNRC does not meet this definition.
    *   **Charter Constitutionality:** The Court surprisingly *sua sponte* declares Sections 1, 2, 3, 4(a), 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 of the PNRC Charter (RA 95), as amended, **VOID** because they create the PNRC as a private corporation by special charter, violating Section 16, Article XII of the Constitution, citing *Feliciano v. Commission on Audit*.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Camporedondo v. NLRC (1999):** Overruled in implication - The Court had previously ruled that the PNRC is a GOCC. The decision in *Liban v. Gordon* acknowledges the *Camporedondo* ruling but argues it failed to consider the definition of a GOCC as provided under Section 2(13) of the Introductory Provisions of the Administrative Code of 1987.
*   **Flores v. Drilon:** Distinguishes facts, as Senator Gordon was not "appointed" to a government office.
*   **Feliciano v. Commission on Audit:** Used to argue that the Constitution prohibits the creation of private corporations except by general law.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Section 13, Article VI, Philippine Constitution:** Prohibition against Senators holding other government offices.
*   **Republic Act No. 95 (PNRC Charter), as amended by Presidential Decree Nos. 1264 and 1643:** Declared partially void.
*   **Section 2(13), Introductory Provisions of the Administrative Code of 1987:** Definition of Government-Owned or Controlled Corporation.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 66 (Quo Warranto)**
*   **Section 16, Article XII Constitution** Prohibition on creating private corporations by special charters

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Court *sua sponte* declared provisions of the PNRC Charter void despite the lack of challenge from the parties. This raises questions about judicial restraint and potential unintended consequences for the PNRC's operations. The dissenting opinion strongly disagrees with this course of action.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **PNRC's Legal Status:**  The PNRC must now incorporate under the Corporation Code and register with the Securities and Exchange Commission if it wants to be a private corporation. This can affect exemptions from payment of all duties, taxes, fees, and other charges of all kinds on all importations and purchases for its exclusive use, on donations for its disaster relief work and other Red Cross services, and in its benefits and fund raising drives
*   **Funding:** As GOCC, the PNRC was entitled to the benefit extended by government and LGUs for operation. If the PNRC is a private corporation, this type of donation may be challenged by the tax authority as an act of misappropriation.
*   **Future Challenges:**  The *Liban v. Gordon* decision is based on a specific set of facts and arguments.  Future legal challenges could arise based on different interpretations of the relevant laws and constitutional provisions, as well as changes in the PNRC's operations or structure.

**Dissenting Opinion (Nachura, J.):**

*   Disagrees with the characterization of the petition as quo warranto, arguing it is a petition for prohibition.
*   Maintains that the PNRC is a GOCC or government instrumentality. The charter does not violate the constitutional prohibition against the creation of private corporations by special law, and Senator Gordon's continuous occupancy of two incompatible positions is a clear violation of the Constitution.
