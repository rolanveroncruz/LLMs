## Legal Document Summary: Trinidad v. Court of Appeals, 352 Phil. 12 (G.R. No. 118904, April 20, 1998)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision regarding an action for partition and damages.

**Key Issue:** Proof of marriage and filiation in the absence of a marriage contract and birth certificate, and the effect of acquisitive prescription on co-owned property.

**Facts:**

*   Arturio Trinidad (Petitioner) filed suit against Felix and Lourdes Trinidad (Respondents) for partition of four parcels of land, claiming he was the legitimate son of Inocentes Trinidad, one of the original owner Patricio Trinidad's three children
*   Respondents denied Arturio was Inocentes' son, claiming Inocentes died single.
*   Petitioner presented testimonial and documentary evidence, including a baptismal certificate and family photos, to prove his filiation and his parents' marriage. A certification from the Civil Registrar of Aklan was also provided showing that records of births, deaths, and marriages were either lost, burned or destroyed during the Japanese occupation of said municipality.
*   Respondents presented witnesses claiming Inocentes died single.
*   The trial court ruled in favor of the Petitioner, finding him to be the legitimate son of Inocentes Trinidad and entitled to inherit a share of the property.
*   The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Petitioner failed to adduce sufficient evidence of his parents' marriage and that acquisitive prescription had set in against him.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Proof of Marriage and Filiation:**
    *   The Court emphasized that marriage, when in dispute, can be proven by relevant evidence beyond a marriage contract, citing *Pugeda v. Trias*. This includes witness testimony, cohabitation as husband and wife, birth and baptismal certificates of children, and mention in subsequent documents.
    *   **Testimonial evidence**: the marriage occurred on May 5, 1942 in New Washington, Aklan; and Jovita Gerardo, who testified that the couple deported themselves as husband and wife after the marriage.
    *   **Documentary evidence**: petitioner presented a certification from the Civil Registrar of Aklan that all records of births, deaths and marriages were either lost, burned or destroyed during the Japanese occupation of said municipality.
    *    Filiation can be proven by the record of birth appearing in the Civil Register, or by an authentic document or a final judgment.
    *    In the absence of a record of birth, authentic document, final judgment or possession of status, legitimate filiation may be proved by any other means allowed by the Rules of Court and special laws
    *   The Supreme Court found the Petitioner's evidence sufficient to prove his filiation, overturning the CA's decision. The baptismal certificate, coupled with testimonial evidence and acceptance by the respondents (prior to the dispute) as Inocentes' son, constituted preponderant evidence.
    *   Cited *Mendoza v. Court of Appeals*, affirming that an illegitimate child is allowed to establish his claimed filiation by any other means allowed by the Rules of Court and special laws.
*   **Collateral Attack on Filiation:** The Court noted that attacks on filiation are generally not permitted collaterally but did not rule specifically on this point, given the sufficient evidence presented.
*   **Acquisitive Prescription:**
    *   The Court held that acquisitive prescription did not apply.
    *   In a co-ownership, the act of one benefits all the other co-owners, unless the former repudiates the co-ownership.
    *    prescription does not run against private respondents with respect to the filing of the action for partition so long as the heirs for whose benefit prescription is invoked, have not expressly or impliedly repudiated the co-ownership.
    *   Cited *Mariategui v. Court of Appeals*, stating prescription for partition does not lie except when co-ownership is properly repudiated, and partition is imprescriptible unless repudiation is clearly communicated.

**Statutory and Case Law References:**

*   **Articles 265, 266, and 267 (now Arts. 170 & 171) of the Civil Code**: On proving filiation.
*   **Rule 130, Sections 40 and 41 of the Rules of Evidence**: Admissibility of evidence on pedigree and common reputation.
*   **Rule 131, Section 3(aa) of the Rules of Evidence**: Disputable presumption of marriage from cohabitation.
*   ***Pugeda v. Trias***: On modes of proving marriage.
*   ***Mendoza v. Court of Appeals***: On proving filiation for illegitimate children.
*   ***Mariategui v. Court of Appeals***: On acquisitive prescription and repudiation of co-ownership.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Weight of Evidence:** The core of the case hinged on the SC's reassessment of the evidence, highlighting the importance of witness credibility and documentary support in family law disputes, especially when records are unavailable.
*   **Repudiation of Co-ownership:** The absence of clear evidence of repudiation of the co-ownership by the respondents was crucial to the court's decision.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The petitioner successfully discharged the burden of proving his filiation by preponderant evidence, underscoring the responsibility of plaintiffs to present compelling evidence, especially where crucial records are missing.
