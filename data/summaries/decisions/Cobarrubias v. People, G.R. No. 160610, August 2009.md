**Legal Document Summary: *Cobarrubias v. People***

**Case:** G.R. No. 160610, August 14, 2009 (612 Phil. 984)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of Court of Appeals Resolutions dismissing a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the petition based on technicality and failing to correct a clerical error in the dispositive portion of the trial court's order.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Cobarrubias was charged with Frustrated Homicide (94-5036), Homicide (94-5038), Violation of Omnibus Election Code (24-392), and Illegal Possession of Firearms (94-5037).
*   The Trial Court (RTC) issued an order dismissing cases 94-5036 and 94-5037 and setting 94-5038 and 24-392 for further trial.
*   Cobarrubias moved to correct a perceived clerical error, arguing that the intent of the RTC was to dismiss 94-5038 (Homicide), as stated in the body of the order.
*   The Acting Judge (Maceda) denied the motion, deeming the error substantial.
*   Cobarrubias filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA initially dismissed the petition due to procedural errors, then directed impleading the People of the Philippines as respondent, before eventually dismissing the petition for failure to comply with this directive.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA and granted the petition. The SC found the petition meritorious, holding that the CA erred in dismissing the petition based on a technicality, especially after the petitioner substantially complied by moving for reconsideration and filing an amended petition to include the People of the Philippines as respondent. It corrected the dispositive portion of the RTC Order to conform to the body of the decision, dismissing the Homicide and Frustrated Homicide charges (94-5036 and 94-5038) and setting the illegal possession of firearms and Election Code violation cases (94-5037 and 24-392) for further trial.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Rule 65, Section 8 of the Rules of Court:** Regarding grounds for dismissal of petitions. The court noted that while this Rule allows for dismissal of a petition prosecuted manifestly for delay, rules should be liberally construed.
*   **Section 6, Rule 1 of the Rules of Court:** Rules shall be liberally construed to secure a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action.
*   **Section 5, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure** all criminal actions are prosecuted under the direction and control of the public prosecutor.
*   The trial court's original order had a conflict between the body, which indicated intent to dismiss the homicide charge (94-5038), and the dispositive portion which incorrectly dismissed the illegal possesion of firearms charge (94-5037).

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Non-Compliance:**  Initial non-compliance with CA rules regarding the impleading of the People of the Philippines risked dismissal.
*   **Conflicting Judgement:** Risk of incorrect application of the law had the dispositive portion of the lower court ruling, due to an apparent clerical error, been executed over the body of the judgement

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The interpretation of whether the error in the RTC order was a mere clerical error or a substantial error affecting the merits of the case. The RTC judge assigned post-retirement of original judge determined it was substantial. This interpretation of the case was changed on appeal.

**Legal Strategy Implication:**

The case underscores the importance of substantial compliance with procedural rules and the power of the court to correct its own clerical errors when the intent is clear from the body of the decision.
