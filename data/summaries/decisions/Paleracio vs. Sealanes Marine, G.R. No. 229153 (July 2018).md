**Case Summary: Paleracio v. Sealanes Marine Services, Inc., et al. (G.R. No. 229153, July 9, 2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's annulment of the NLRC's decision awarding permanent and total disability benefits to a seafarer.

**Facts:** Petitioner Paleracio, an Able Bodied Seaman, sustained a right arm injury while on duty. He was repatriated, treated by company-designated physicians who later declared him fit to work. Paleracio consulted a private physician, Dr. Ticman, who declared him permanently unfit.  He filed a complaint for disability benefits. The LA dismissed the complaint, but the NLRC reversed, awarding disability compensation. The CA reversed the NLRC, favoring the company-designated physician's assessment.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **POEA-SEC, Sec. 20(A):** Governs compensation and benefits for work-related injury/illness. Requires seafarer to undergo post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three (3) working days upon repatriation. Outlines process for conflict resolution with a third doctor. Paleracio's employment contract is covered by the 2010 POEA-SEC.

*   **Burden of Proof:** Seafarer bears the burden of proving the injury/illness occurred during the contract term. Employer bears the burden of justifying any extension of the initial 120-day assessment period by the company-designated physician.

**Key Holdings & Reasoning:**

*   **Third Doctor Referral:** While referral to a third doctor is mandatory when there is a conflict between the company doctor and seafarer's doctor, this only applies if the company-designated doctor provides a *valid and timely* assessment.

*   **Timeliness of Medical Assessment:** The company-designated physician must issue a definitive assessment (fitness or disability) within 120 days, extendable to 240 days *with sufficient justification* (e.g., further treatment needed).  The company-designated physician's assessment on March 21, 2013 was deemed invalid as it was issued *after* the initial 120-day period expired on Jan 25, 2013 and there was no justification provided to extend the treatment or assessment period to 240 days.

*   **Post-Employment Examination:** The Court acknowledged that Paleracio reported to the manning agency five days upon disembarkation, the Court noted that the POEA-SEC specifically provides for three working days and not calendar days. Respondents could have easily presented any proof of the normal working days of the manning agency to support their allegation that he indeed reported for post-employment medical examination beyond the authorized period.

*   **Permanent Total Disability:** The Court held that the lack of a conclusive and definite medical assessment from the company-designated physician within the prescribed period, which left Paleracio nothing to properly contest, negates the need to comply with the third-doctor referral provision under the POEA-SEC. Without a valid final and definite assessment from the company-designated physician, the law already steps in to consider the seafarer's disability as total and permanent.

*   **Attorney's Fees:** The award of attorney's fees was deleted because Paleracio failed to prove bad faith on the part of the respondents in denying his claim.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 198 (c)(1):** Temporary total disability during the 120-day period.
*   **Amended Rules on Employees Compensation (AREC), Rule VII, Section 2 (b):**  Temporary total disability during the 120-day period.

**Case Law:**

*   **Interorient Maritime Enterprises, Inc. v. Remo, 636 Phil. 240 (2010):** Discusses exceptions to the rule against factual review in Rule 45 petitions.
*   **Marlow Navigation Philippines, Inc., et al. v. Osias, 773 Phil. 428, 446 (2015):** Requisites for mandatory referral to a third doctor.
*   **Philippine Hammonia Ship Agency, Inc., et al. v. Dumadag, 712 Phil. 507, 521 (2013):** Non-compliance with conflict resolution affirms the company-designated physician's certification.
*   **Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc. v. Munar, 702 Phil. 717, 737-738 (2013):** A seafarer's compliance with such procedure presupposes that the company-designated physician came up with an assessment as to his fitness or unfitness to work before the expiration of the 120-day or 240-day periods.
*   **Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc., el al. v. Quiogue, Jr., 765 Phil. 341, 364 (2015):** An effective medical assessment from the company-designated physician must be issued within the authorized 120-day period or the properly extended 240-day period.
*   **C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc., et al. v. Taok, 691 Phil. 521 (2012):** Enumerates causes of action for total and permanent disability benefits.
*   **Heirs of Dela Cruz v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc., et al., 758 Phil. 382, 394-395 (2015):** Three-day mandatory reporting requirement.
*   **Career Philippines Shipmanagement, Inc., et al. v. Serna, 700 Phil. 1, 15 (2012):** Reciprocal obligations.
*   **Aldaba v. Career Philippines, G.R. No. 218242, June 21, 2017.** The employer has the burden to prove that the company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the period of treatment or assessment.
*   **Talaroc v. Arpaphil Shipping Corp., G.R. No. 223731, August 30, 2017.** Without a valid final and definite assessment from the company-designated physician, the law already steps in to consider the seafarer's disability as total and permanent.
*   **Olidana v. Jebsens Maritime, Inc., 772 Phil. 234, 245 (2015).** The foremost consideration of the courts should be to determine whether the medical assessment or report of the company-designated physician was complete and appropriately issued; otherwise, the medical report shall be set aside and the disability grading contained therein cannot be seriously appreciated.
*   **Manota, et al. v. Avantgarde Shipping Corp., et al., 715 Phil. 54, 63 (2013).** Whoever claims entitlement to the benefits provided by law should establish his right to the benefits by substantial evidence

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timeliness of reporting:** Paleracio reported to the manning agency five days upon disembarkation, the Court noted that the POEA-SEC specifically provides for three working days and not calendar days.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's liability for disability benefits:** The employer (Sealanes, Spliethoff) is liable for US$80,000.00 disability compensation to Paleracio due to the failure of the company-designated physician to provide a valid and timely assessment within the prescribed 120/240-day period. The court noted that the company designated physician issued his assessment only after 175 days and there was no medical report justifying the extension of the said period to 240 days.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *partially granted* Paleracio's petition, reversing the CA and reinstating the NLRC's decision awarding disability benefits. However, the award of attorney's fees was deleted, and Paleracio was ordered to return the amount he received for attorney's fees.
