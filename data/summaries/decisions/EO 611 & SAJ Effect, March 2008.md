## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 07-8-3-SC

**Case:** Re: Query on the Effect of the 10% Salary Increase under Executive Order No. 611 on the Special Allowance for the Judiciary (SAJ)

**Court:** En Banc, Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Date:** March 28, 2008

**Issue:** Clarification on the effect of a 10% salary increase under E.O. No. 611 on the Special Allowance for the Judiciary (SAJ) of justices, judges, and court officials equivalent to CA/RTC judges, considering Section 6 of R.A. No. 9227. Specifically, whether to deduct 10% from the SAJ and whether to source the increase from the SAJ fund.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court ruled that **the 10% salary increase under E.O. No. 611 *must* be implemented by deducting 10% from the monthly SAJ and sourcing the increase from the SAJ fund.**

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9227, Section 6:**  Crucial provision stating that subsequent salary increases under R.A. No. 6758 (as amended) are to be considered as implementation of the SAJ, with the corresponding increase converted to basic salary, provided excess in SAJ after the increase is still granted.
*   **E.O. No. 611:** Executive order authorizing a 10% salary increase for government personnel covered by the Compensation and Position Classification System under R.A. 6758.
*   **R.A. No. 6758:** Standardizes the salary of government employees.
*   **DBM Circular Letter No. 2007-9:** Clarification from the DBM regarding special allowances and salary increases.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1949:** Establishes the Judiciary Development Fund.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The Fiscal Management and Budget Office (FMBO) is obligated to deduct 10% from the monthly SAJ and source the 10% salary increase from the SAJ fund.
*   Justices, judges, and court officials will receive a 10% increase in their basic salary, but their monthly SAJ will be reduced accordingly.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Decreased Net Income:** The conversion of SAJ into basic salary results in an increase in taxable income for justices, judges, and court officials, potentially reducing their net income.
*   **Long-Term Impact:** Over time, continuous salary increases and corresponding SAJ deductions may erode the attractiveness of judicial positions compared to other government positions, potentially defeating the purpose of R.A. No. 9227 (attracting qualified lawyers to the judiciary).
*   **Disparity with Judiciary Development Fund (JDF):** Other court personnel, who receive additional allowances from the surplus SAJ fund and who are also augmented by the JDF, may benefit disproportionately compared to justices and judges in the long run.
*   **Judicial Independence Concern:** This decision could indirectly impact judicial independence by affecting the compensation of judicial officers. A future decrease in the attractiveness of a judicial position due to its compensation may lead to lower quality applicants for the same position, and thus affect the quality of justice, an integral component of judicial independence.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **In Re: Request of Retired Justices of the Supreme Court for Upgrading of their Retirement Gratuities (A.M. No. 04-11-06-SC, March 14, 2006):** The Supreme Court reiterated its recognition of the SAJ as forming part of the basic salary.
*   **Nitafan v. Commission on Internal Revenue, G.R. No. 103524, April 15, 1992:** Taxation of judiciary.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   **R.A. No. 9227, Section 6:** While the SC acknowledges the negative long-term consequences of this section, the Court adheres to the *verba legis* principle, stating that the clear and unambiguous language of the law must be followed, even if it leads to absurd or mischievous results.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court, bound by the express language of Section 6 of R.A. No. 9227, mandates the deduction of 10% from the SAJ to fund the 10% salary increase under E.O. No. 611. The Court acknowledges the potential for long-term negative consequences and encourages future legislation to rectify this issue. The implementation may have unforeseen taxation implications for covered judicial officers, and may impact the quality of applicants for judicial positions.
