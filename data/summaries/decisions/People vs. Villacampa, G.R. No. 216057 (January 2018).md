## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Villacampa, G.R. No. 216057

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming RTC conviction of Ceferino Villacampa for multiple counts of rape and acts of lasciviousness against minor siblings, in relation to RA 7610.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** Villacampa was found guilty of nine counts of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610, one count of simple rape under the RPC, and one count of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610.
*   **RA 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act):** Found applicable due to the victims' ages being under 18 and Villacampa's exertion of moral ascendancy rendering victims subject to sexual abuse. Specifically, Section 5(b) regarding sexual abuse.
*   **Article 266-A, Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines rape, including sexual assault involving insertion of objects. This forms the basis for the rape conviction (FC Criminal Case No. 1368).
*   **Findings of Fact:** The RTC and CA relied heavily on the testimonies of the victims detailing the acts of sexual abuse (finger insertion, licking) and rape (penile penetration). Medical examinations provided corroborating evidence, specifically healed hymenal lacerations.
* **Quimvel v. People, G.R. No. 214497:** Cited to establish that a single act of sexual abuse can classify a child as "subjected to other sexual abuse" under RA 7610.
*   **People v. Caoili, G.R. Nos. 196342 and 196848:** Establishes guidelines for the proper nomenclature and penalties for lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610, considering the victim's age.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Imprisonment:** Indeterminate sentences for each count of Acts of Lasciviousness and Lascivious Conduct, and Reclusion Perpetua for Simple Rape.
*   **Fines:** P15,000 for each count of Acts of Lasciviousness and Lascivious Conduct under RA 7610.
*   **Damages:**  Civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages awarded for each offense.
*   **Interest:** 6% per annum on all damages awarded from the date of finality of the decision.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Nomenclature Confusion:** There were initial errors in the nomenclature of the offenses by lower courts, requiring clarification and adjustment of penalties based on *People v. Caoili*.  This highlights potential challenges in correctly applying RA 7610 in conjunction with the RPC.
*   **Age-Based Penalties:** The distinction in penalties based on the victims' ages (under 12 vs. over 12) creates complexity and potential for misapplication. Specifically, the Court adjusted the judgment to reflect that penalties are determined by RA 7610.
*   **Villacampa's Defense:** Villacampa claimed the victims fabricated the stories under the influence of their father and aunt. This highlights a common defense strategy in sexual abuse cases, focusing on credibility and potential bias.
* **Lack of Contemporaneous Reporting:** While addressed by the court's application of relevant law and consistent testimony, there's a potential point of contention arising from delays in the victims reporting the incidents.
