## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Bugna* (G.R. No. 218255)

**Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Jerry Bugna y Britanico (Bugna) for two counts of Qualified Rape under Article 266-B(1) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 266-B(1) RPC (Qualified Rape):** Defines rape committed by a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, or relative within the third civil degree or the common-law spouse against a minor through force, threat, or intimidation. Requires (a) sexual congress, (b) with a woman, (c) done by force and without consent, (d) victim is a minor at the time, and (e) offender is a parent or related as defined.
*   **RA 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, replacing it with reclusion perpetua where the death penalty is prescribed under the RPC.

**Facts:**

*   Bugna was charged with two counts of rape against AAA, his xxxxxxxx, in separate incidents on April 7, 2007, and December 21, 2007, when AAA was 16 years old.
*   The prosecution presented AAA's testimony and medical evidence showing healed lacerations on her hymen.
*   The defense presented Bugna's alibi, claiming he was away from home during the relevant periods.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   Affirmed the conviction for two counts of qualified rape.
*   Rejected Bugna's alibi, citing AAA's positive identification.
*   Held that the xxxxxx relationship substituted the element of force and intimidation, citing *People v. Castel* for the proposition that actual force isn't required in xxxxxx rape when there is over powering xxxxxx influence.
*   Rejected Bugna's argument that the lack of resistance demonstrated consent, citing *People v. Joson* and emphasizing that resistance is not an element of rape, particularly where threats and intimidation are present, or a xxxxxxx relationship exists.
*   Positive identification by the victim held to outweigh defense of alibi (*People v. Dadao*).
*   Applied *People v. Jugueta* to modify and increase damages awarded.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Bugna is obligated to serve a sentence of reclusion perpetua for each count of rape.
*   Bugna is liable for P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of rape, plus 6% interest per annum from finality of the judgment.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   While seemingly settled, the court acknowledges the "Me Too" movement, so a potential appeal focusing on the lack of physical evidence of resistance, while unlikely to succeed, could introduce societal pressure on judicial precedent.
