**Legal Document Summary: People v. Vibar, G.R. No. 215790**

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Mauricio Cabajar Vibar (Vibar) for Rape under Article 266-B(1) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Vibar was charged with rape of AAA (minor at the time of the incident).
*   **Prosecution's Case:** AAA testified that Vibar forcibly brought her inside a nipa hut and had carnal knowledge of her.
*   **Defense's Case:** Vibar denied the charges, alleging fabrication and conspiracy. He presented a letter purportedly written by AAA recanting her accusation, claiming coercion.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Vibar guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC ruling.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused to face imprisonment.
*   Accused ordered to pay for civil, moral and exemplary damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   The accused is fully liable to all the payment of damages to the victim
*   The accused is fully liable and convicted of the crime.

**Damages Modified:**

*   Based on *People v. Jugueta*, the court modified the damages awarded to the victim: P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages, with 6% interest per annum from finality of judgment.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Authentication of Letter:** The key contentious issue is the admissibility of the letter purportedly written by the victim recanting her accusation. The court deemed the letter inadmissible due to lack of authentication per Section 20, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court. There was no witness to the writing or signature, and Vibar's self-serving testimony was insufficient.
*   **Medical Report:** Vibar argued a lack of physical evidence of penetration because no lacerations were found. The Court properly dismissed this, citing that medical reports are corroborative. Medical testimony did support penetration.
*   **Delay in Re-filing Case:** While there was a delay between the initial incident and the re-filing of the case, the Court acknowledges the initial lack of support from the victim's family and threats from the accused as valid reasons for the initial reluctance.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-B(1) RPC:** Defines and penalizes Rape.
*   **Section 20, Rule 132, Rules of Court:** Outlines requirements for authenticating private documents.
*   ***People v. Amarela***: Emphasizes the importance of evaluating rape victim testimony without gender bias.
*   ***People v. Jugueta***: Sets precedent for damages in rape cases where the death penalty is commuted under R.A. No. 9346.
*   **R.A. No. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, resulting in a reduced sentence.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, focusing on the credibility of the victim's testimony (despite the lack of corroborating physical injury) and the failure of the defense to properly authenticate the recantation letter. The damages were modified to conform to the precedent set in *People v. Jugueta*. The case highlights the court's reliance on witness testimony in rape cases where physical evidence is scarce, and the strict requirements for admitting private documents into evidence. The accused is fully liable and convicted of the crime.
