**Legal Document Summary: *People of the Philippines vs. Danilo Sia y Binghay* (G.R. No. 174059)**

**Case Summary:**

This is a criminal appeal to the Supreme Court concerning a conviction for statutory rape under Article 266-A(1)(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353.  The accused, Danilo Sia y Binghay, was found guilty of sexually abusing a 4-year-old minor. The RTC and CA both convicted the accused based on the victim's positive identification, despite his alibi. The SC affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty and damages.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Article 266-A(1)(d) of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes statutory rape (carnal knowledge of a minor).
*   **RA 9346:** Commutes the death penalty to reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of statutory rape. Sentence: Reclusion Perpetua without eligibility for parole.
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   Civil indemnity ex delicto: P75,000
    *   Moral damages: P75,000
    *   Exemplary damages: P30,000
    *   Costs of the suit.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Victim Testimony:** The core of the prosecution's case rested on the testimony of a four-year-old victim. While deemed credible by the courts due to her age and lack of motive to fabricate, challenges to the reliability of such testimony are always potential points of contention.
*   **Alibi:** The defense's alibi was weak and insufficient to overcome the victim's identification, but an appeal based on misidentification or mistaken identity is a common strategy.
*   **Medical Evidence Interpretation:** The medical findings of vaginal and perineal lacerations were critical.  A potential risk would be challenging the accuracy of the medical examination or alternative explanations for the injuries.
*   **Lack of Parole Eligibility:** The imposition of reclusion perpetua without parole eligibility raises questions about the defendant's future and ability to contribute to society.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 266-A(1)(d):** Statutory rape definition.
*   **RA 8353:** Amendment to the Revised Penal Code concerning rape.
*   **RA 9346:** Law prohibiting the imposition of the death penalty, resulting in commutation to reclusion perpetua.
*   **People v. Rentoria, G.R. No. 175333:** Precedent regarding positive identification overcoming alibi.

*   **People v. Abellera, G.R. No. 166617:** Precedent regarding the amount of moral and exemplary damages awarded in statutory rape cases.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

There are no particularly ambiguous clauses. The core issue revolved around the factual determination of guilt based on the victim's testimony and medical evidence.  The potential areas for further appeal would likely focus on challenging the assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the proper application of the law regarding penalties and damages.
