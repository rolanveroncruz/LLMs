## Asset Privatization Trust v. Court of Appeals, et al. - Summary

**Case Citation:** 360 Phil. 768 (G.R. No. 121171, December 29, 1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which denied due course to APT's Petition for Certiorari. The CA decision upheld a Regional Trial Court (RTC) order confirming an arbitration award in favor of Marinduque Mining and Industrial Corporation (MMIC) against the Asset Privatization Trust (APT).

**Key Provisions and Antecedent Facts:**

*   **Background:** MMIC was granted exclusive rights to explore and exploit minerals in the Surigao Mineral Reservation under RA 1828, as amended. The Philippine Government supported MMIC's financing through debentures, guarantees, and commitments for foreign loans (DBP and/or other government financing institutions to subscribed in MMIC and issue guarantee/s for foreign loans). DBP approved guarantee. DBP and PNB later extended loans and accommodations.
*   **Mortgage Trust Agreement:** MMIC, PNB, and DBP entered into a Mortgage Trust Agreement (MTA).  Article IV stipulated Events of Default, including failure to pay amounts secured by the MTA. Article V prescribed in detail circumstances by which the mortgagor may be declared in default. MMIC failed to meet financial obligations (P22.6 Billion owed to DBP and PNB by 1984).
*   **Financial Restructuring Plan (FRP):** A FRP was drafted but never formally adopted or ratified by PNB or DBP. The Sycip Gorres Velayo accounting firm, drafted a financial restructuring plan (FRP) designed to reduce MMIC’s interest expense through debt conversion to equity was drafted by the Sycip Gorres Velayo accounting firm.
*   **Foreclosure:** Due to overdue loans and non-feasibility of restructuring, PNB and DBP foreclosed on MMIC's assets extrajudicially, pursuant to PD 385 and the Mortgage Trust Agreement. The foreclosed assets were sold to PNB and assigned to newly formed corporations. The government financial institutions were mandated by P.D. No. 385 to foreclose when arrearages amount to 20% of the total outstanding obligations. These assets were later transferred to APT in 1986.
*   **Derivative Suit and Arbitration:**  Minority stockholders of MMIC (Cabarrus, et al.) filed a derivative suit (Civil Case No. 9900) against DBP and PNB for annulment of foreclosure, specific performance, and damages, alleging an illegal foreclosure. The case was transferred to the APT. The parties entered into a "Compromise and Arbitration Agreement" under RA 876, limiting the issues to the validity of the foreclosure and the Plaintiffs’ capacity to institute the derivative suit. The agreement converted all claims into purely monetary claims.
*   **RTC Order:** The RTC approved the agreement, substituted APT for PNB and DBP, and *dismissed* the complaint.
*   **Arbitration Award:** The Arbitration Committee ruled in favor of MMIC, finding the foreclosure invalid and awarding damages of P2.5 Billion plus interest. The decision was declared "FINAL and EXECUTORY."
*   **RTC Confirmation:** The RTC confirmed the award despite APT's opposition arguing lack of jurisdiction due to the prior dismissal and that the arbitrators exceeded their power. The trial court ordered the APT to pay approximately P3.8 Billion in actual damages, plus moral and exemplary damages, and arbitration costs.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA denied APT's Petition for Certiorari, upholding the RTC's confirmation order.

**Key Legal Issues and Contentions:**

*   **Jurisdiction of RTC:** Did the RTC (Branch 62) have jurisdiction to confirm the award after it had *dismissed* the underlying case? APT argued the dismissal terminated jurisdiction, requiring a new case.
*   **Estoppel:** Was APT estopped from challenging the RTC's jurisdiction after participating in the confirmation proceedings and seeking affirmative relief (vacating the award)?
*   **Scope of Arbitration:** Did the Arbitration Committee exceed its powers by ruling on issues beyond the submission agreement (e.g., validity of FRP) and awarding damages to a non-party (MMIC)? Did the arbitrators exceed their powers by awarding moral damages to a direct stockholder who was not a party to the suit?
*   **Validity of Foreclosure:** Was the foreclosure by PNB and DBP valid, considering the alleged FRP and compliance with publication requirements?
*   **Propriety of Damages:** Were the damages awarded proper, including moral damages to the individual stockholder Cabarrus and moral damages to the corporation? Should moral damages be given when MMIC's credit reputation was already damaged?
*   **Certiorari as Substitute for Appeal:** Was APT's Petition for Certiorari a valid substitute for a lost appeal?

**Court's Ruling:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and *vacated* the arbitration award. The Supreme Court ruled that there was no valid decision.

**Reasoning:**

*   The RTC lacked jurisdiction because its prior order *dismissing* the case was a final disposition. The Supreme Court ruled that the RTC lacked the power to validly confirm the judgment, since the previous decision was final.
*   APT was not estopped because it consistently challenged the RTC's jurisdiction.
*   The Arbitration Committee exceeded its powers by ruling on matters outside the scope of the submission agreement (FRP) and awarding damages to MMIC and Cabarrus (Sr.). There was no valid contract because not all parties had assented to it.
*   The foreclosure was justified, as there was no binding FRP.
*   Appeal via Certiorari was proper, given the jurisdictional issues and grave abuse of discretion.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Dismissal":** The RTC's use of the term "dismissed" created ambiguity, leading to jurisdictional disputes.
*   **Validity of FRP:** The purported validity of the FRP was central to the damage award, yet its existence as a binding agreement was questionable.
*   **Arbitration Agreement's Scope:** The vague language of the arbitration agreement led to disputes regarding the arbitrators' authority. The arbitrators had exceeded their authority in awarding damages to MMIC and Jesus Cabarrus, Sr.
*   **Damage Calculation:** There were evident errors in the damage calculation and a lack of factual basis for the awards.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   RA 1828, as amended (Surigao Mineral Reservation)
*   RA 876 (Arbitration Law)
*   PD 385 (Mandatory Foreclosure by GFIs)
*   Civil Code provisions on compromise and arbitration (Articles 2038, 2039, 2040)
*   Rules of Court, Rule 65 (Certiorari)

**Note:**  The dissenting opinion argued strongly in favor of upholding the arbitration award, emphasizing the importance of honoring arbitration agreements and the limited scope of judicial review.
