## Legal Document Summary: Quisumbing v. Sandiganbayan

**Case:** Ramon J. Quisumbing v. Sandiganbayan (Fifth Division), Republic of the Philippines, and Philippine Journalist, Inc. (PJI) G.R. No. 138437, November 14, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing Sandiganbayan Resolutions denying Petitioner's Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. 0172.

**Background:**
*   Civil Case No. 0035 filed by the PCGG against Benjamin Romualdez, et al., for recovery of ill-gotten wealth, including PJI properties.
*   While Case 0035 was pending, PCGG-appointed PJI directors sold Mabini lots to Petitioner Quisumbing as trustee of Doy Development Corporation.
*   Sandiganbayan nullified the sales, deemed them without prior approval and consent.
*   PCGG and PJI filed Civil Case No. 0172 against Petitioner for reconveyance of the Mabini lots.
*   Petitioner filed a Motion to Dismiss, claiming no cause of action and that the Republic wasn't a real party of interest.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sequestration:** The central issue is whether the Mabini lots were under sequestration, requiring Sandiganbayan approval for sale. This is intertwined with the validity of the Sequestration Order(s).
*   **Real Party in Interest:** The Republic's standing to sue for reconveyance is challenged. The Court reaffirms the Republic's status as a real party in interest because it stands to benefit from the recovery of ill-gotten wealth under EO No. 2.
*   **Reconveyance:** The core relief sought is the reconveyance of the Mabini lots to PJI.
*   **Custodia Legis:** Properties of sequestered entities are considered under *custodia legis*.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Quisumbing's Liability:** If the lots were indeed sequestered, Quisumbing is potentially liable for reconveyance of the property and damages.
*   **Validity of Sale:** The validity of the sale is at risk due to the lack of Sandiganbayan approval and the potential invalidity of management contracts.
*   **Delay:** Continued litigation risks further depreciation of the property and increased legal costs.
*   **Conflicting Rulings**: The lower court rulings are interlocutory and can be reversed in the future.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Executive Order No. 2:** Provides the legal basis for recovering ill-gotten wealth for the benefit of the Republic and the Filipino people.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 3, Sec. 2:** Defines "real party in interest."
*   **Meralco v. Sandiganbayan, 232 SCRA 644 (1994):** Cites concern about the deterioration and disappearance of sequestered assets.
*   **Republic v. Sandiganbayan, 355 Phil. 181 (1998):** Relates to the requirement of two commissioners to sign sequestration orders. Addressed through a validated two-signature writ.
*   **G.R. No. 106209:** This court sustained the Sandiganbayan ruling that PJI is a sequestered corporation and its assets under *custodia legis*
*   **G.R. No. 108552, Asset Privatization Trust v. Sandiganbayan (Second Division) and Rosario Olivarez, 341 SCRA 551 (2000):** Addressed loans PJI contracted before its sequestration, and not the general issue of PJI being sequestered.
*   **G.R. No. 138598, Asset Privatization Trust v. Sandiganbayan (5th Division ) and Rosario Olivarez, 360 SCRA 437 (2001):** APT was directed to turn over the management and control of PJI to its former stockholders upon payment of their outstanding obligations.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Scope of Sequestration Order:** The extent to which the Sequestration Order covers the assets of PJI, beyond simply the shares of Romualdez et al., is a crucial point of contention. The original order's scope is ambiguous.
*   **Validity of PCGG Board Actions:** The authority of the PCGG-appointed board to sell the Mabini lots without prior Sandiganbayan approval remains a central legal question.

**Overall Risk Assessment:**

The Petitioner faces a significant risk of being compelled to reconvey the Mabini lots. The Supreme Court upheld the Sandiganbayan's finding that the Republic is a real party in interest, further strengthening the government's case. While factual disputes regarding the scope and validity of the original sequestration order existed, the Supreme Court found that the Mabini lots were also sequestered.
