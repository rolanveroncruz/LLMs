**Legal Document Summary (G.R. No. 152496): Anunciacion v. Bocanegra**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision that affirmed the RTC's dismissal of a complaint for Quieting of Title and Cancellation of TCT No. 122452.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Background:** Spouses Anunciacion and Conejos filed suit to quiet title against the Bocanegras. The Bocanegras' lawyer, Atty. Pizarro, had previously sent a demand letter to the Anunciacions to vacate the property.
*   **Service of Summons:** Petitioners served summons on Atty. Pizarro. Respondents (Bocanegras) filed a Motion to Dismiss, later amended, ultimately claiming lack of jurisdiction over their persons due to improper service.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** RTC dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction over the persons of the Bocanegras, holding service on Atty. Pizarro was invalid.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** CA affirmed, holding that the Bocanegras did not waive the issue of lack of jurisdiction.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed the CA and RTC. Held that the Bocanegras, by filing a Motion to Dismiss *without* initially raising lack of jurisdiction, had made a voluntary appearance and waived the defense.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners:** Obligation to properly serve summons initially (issue moot after Supreme Court ruling).
*   **Respondents:** Duty to raise all available defenses, including lack of jurisdiction, in the initial Motion to Dismiss.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents (Bocanegras):** Potentially liable if petitioners successfully prove their claim for quieting of title and cancellation of TCT No. 122452.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Waiver:** The core risk is the waiver of a jurisdictional defense (lack of personal jurisdiction) through improper pleading practices. The Bocanegras initially omitted this defense in their Motion to Dismiss.
*   **Omnibus Motion Rule Violation:** Failure to include all available defenses in the initial motion to dismiss violated Rule 15, Section 8 and Rule 9, Section 1 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Bad Faith Allegation:** The Supreme Court suggested a possible bad faith motive in the Bocanegras' belated raising of the improper service issue, given the shared address of their attorneys.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 14, Section 20 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Defines voluntary appearance and its effect. Key to the Supreme Court's decision.
*   **Rule 15, Section 8 in relation to Rule 9, Section 1 of the Rules of Court:** Omnibus Motion Rule, requiring all available defenses to be included in initial motions.
*   **Philippine American Life & General Insurance Company v. Breva (G.R. No. 147937):** Cited to support the principle that a case should not be dismissed simply because of wrongful service, and that alias summons may be issued.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Voluntary Appearance":** The definition and implication of voluntary appearance and whether filing a motion to dismiss on other grounds constitutes a waiver of jurisdictional defenses. This was the central point of contention and the basis for the reversal.
*   **Propriety of Service on Atty. Pizarro:** Though ultimately rendered moot, the issue of whether service on the opposing party's prior counsel constitutes valid service could be contentious in other contexts.
