**Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Charter Insurance Corporation vs. Philippine National Construction Corporation***
G.R. No. 185066, October 02, 2009

**Subject Matter:** Motion for Reconsideration of a denied Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding the liability of Philippine Charter Insurance Corporation (PCIC) under two surety bonds (PCIC Bond Nos. 27546 & 27547) issued for Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) relating to a construction contract.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Contractual Context:** PNCC contracted with Orlando Kalingo for the fabrication and delivery of tollbooths. PNCC issued Purchase Orders 71024L (25 units) and 71025L (2 units). The POs required surety bonds covering 100% of the 50% down payment. PCIC issued surety bonds 27547 and 27546 respectively, guaranteeing the down payments.

*   **Surety Bonds:**
    *   **Bond 27547:** Covers P.O. 71024L (25 units), liability limit P1,050,000.
    *   **Bond 27546:** Covers P.O. 71025L (2 units), liability limit P84,000.
    *   **Expiration Date:** Both bonds expired on March 16, 1998.
    *   **Written Claim Requirement:**  A crucial clause in both bonds stipulates that PCIC is not liable for any claim not presented *in writing* within 15 days of the bond's expiration. The obligee waives the right to sue after this 15-day period from when the cause of action accrues.

*   **Performance and Default:** Kalingo made a partial, non-conforming delivery under P.O. 71024L. Kalingo failed to deliver the remaining tollbooths and defaulted.

*   **PNCC's Claim and Lawsuit:** PNCC filed a written claim against PCIC on March 9, 1998, *only* for Bond 27547 (P.O. 71024L). It did not file any claim for Bond 27546 (P.O. 71025L). PNCC then filed a complaint with the RTC to collect under Bond 27547. The CA then held that the RTC erred and that PCIC was liable for both Bond 27547 and Bond 27546.

**Key Legal Issues and Analysis:**

*   **Cause of Action and the Importance of Pleadings:** The Supreme Court held that the CA erred in finding PCIC liable under Bond 27546 because PNCC's complaint *only* sought recovery under Bond 27547.  A party's relief is generally limited to what is specifically prayed for in the complaint.  While a general prayer for "other just and equitable relief" exists, this is only for other reliefs where a cause of action can exist based on the pleadings and evidence.

*   **Condition Precedent and Contractual Stipulations:** The Supreme Court emphasized the significance of the "written claim" provision in both bonds. It served as a condition precedent.  Failure to present a written claim within 15 days of expiration (as PNCC did with Bond 27546) constitutes a *waiver* of the right to collect under that bond. The bonds are a contract and the terms have the force of law between the parties, per Art. 1159 and Art. 1306 of the Civil Code.

*   **Extent of Surety's Liability:** The SC relied on the well-established principle that the extent of a surety's liability is determined by the contract of suretyship and conditions stated in the bond.  It cannot be extended beyond the terms of the contract by implication, citing *Philippine Commercial & Industrial Bank v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-34959, March 18, 1988.*

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court *granted* PCIC's Motion for Reconsideration.
*   The CA decision was modified, *deleting* PCIC's liability under PCIC Bond No. 27546. PCIC's liability under PCIC Bond No. 27547 was affirmed as well as attorney's fees incurred for compelling PNCC to hire the services of an attorney to collect on PCIC Bond No. 27547.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Strict Interpretation of Contractual Terms:** This case highlights the importance of strict compliance with conditions precedent in surety contracts. The failure to present a written claim, even if arguably a technicality, proved fatal to PNCC's claim under Bond 27546.
*   **Pleading Strategy:** The case underscores the need for careful and comprehensive pleading of all potential claims. Failure to specifically plead a claim can bar recovery, even if evidence related to that claim is presented.
*   **Typographical Error:** While the Court addressed the typographical error in the checks, it is important to ensure dates and information are accurate.

**Recommendations for Counsel:**

*   Meticulously review all contractual documents for conditions precedent and ensure strict compliance.
*   Draft pleadings to encompass all possible claims and theories of recovery.
*   Argue the bond provisions and conditions, including the written claim provision and explain compliance or lack of compliance.
*   Argue that the CA erred in ruling that PCIC was liable for both Bond 27547 and Bond 27546 as a written claim requirement was not met.
