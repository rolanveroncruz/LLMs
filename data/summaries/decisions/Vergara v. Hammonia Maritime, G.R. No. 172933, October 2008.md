## Legal Document Summary: Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc. and Atlantic Marine Ltd. (G.R. No. 172933)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Subject Matter:** Seafarer's claim for disability benefits under the POEA Standard Employment Contract (POEA SEC) and Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) for visual impairment.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Facts:** Seaman Vergara claimed disability benefits after experiencing vision problems (vitreal hemorrhage/glaucoma) during his contract. He underwent treatment, and the company-designated physician declared him "fit to work." Vergara obtained opinions from other doctors claiming unfitness and partial permanent disability.

*   **POEA SEC and CBA:** The POEA SEC and the CBA between AMOSUP and Atlantic Marine govern the seafarer's employment. The POEA SEC Section 20(B)(3) stipulates that after sign-off for medical treatment, the seafarer receives sickness allowance until declared fit or assessed for disability by the company-designated physician, not exceeding 120 days.

*   **Company-Designated Physician's Assessment:** The company-designated physician declared Vergara fit to work within the extended 240-day period. The Supreme Court emphasizes the contractual provision giving weight to the company-designated physician's assessment.

*   **Seafarer's Claims:** Vergara argued that the company doctor's "fit to work" declaration was incorrect, citing opinions from his own physicians. He also argued that being unfit for his specific role as a pumpman equates to total and permanent disability, referring to the CBA clause 20.1.5.

*   **Respondents' Arguments:** Hammonia and Atlantic Marine argued they followed the POEA SEC and CBA, providing adequate treatment resulting in Vergara being declared fit to work. They challenged the competence of the seafarer's doctors and emphasized Vergara's signed "certificate of fitness for work."

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court denied Vergara's petition, upholding the CA's decision.

*   **Rationale:** The company-designated physician's "fit to work" declaration, made within the 240-day period, is controlling because Vergara failed to follow the procedure outlined in the POEA SEC for resolving conflicting medical opinions (i.e., agreeing on a third, independent doctor).

*   **Application of _Crystal Shipping, Inc. v. Natividad_ (G.R. No. 154798):** The Court distinguished _Crystal Shipping_, emphasizing that its ruling on 120-day disability periods shouldn't be applied rigidly without considering the specific context and the POEA SEC's provisions on disability assessment and benefits.  In _Crystal Shipping_, the seafarer's disability went beyond 240 days without a fitness declaration.

**Key Legal Issues and Potential Risks:**

*   **Validity of the "Fit to Work" Declaration:** The court gave great weight to the certification of the company-designated physician.

*   **Conflict of Medical Opinions:** The POEA SEC outlines a process for resolving disagreements between the company's doctor and the seafarer's doctor. Failure to follow this process weakens the seafarer's case.

*   **Timeframes for Disability Assessment:** Strict adherence to the 120/240-day period for medical assessment.  The seafarer must be diligently monitored and assessed within these timeframes to avoid claims of permanent disability by default.

*   **Contractual Obligations vs. Medical Realities:** Tension between the contractual framework (POEA SEC, CBA) and the seafarer's actual medical condition. The court prioritizes the contractual agreement and the opinions of designated experts over the subjective experience of the seafarer.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code (Articles 191-193):** Disability Benefits
*   **Rule X, Rules and Regulations Implementing Book IV of the Labor Code:**  Period of Entitlement.

*   **Article 4 of the Labor Code:**  Construction in favor of labor

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   Interpretation of "fit to work" in the context of a specific job (pumpman) versus a general ability to work.
*   The extent to which a company-designated physician's opinion should be privileged when the physician is not a specialist in the relevant field.

**Liability:**

*   Respondents, Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc. and Atlantic Marine Ltd., were relieved of liability for disability and sickness benefits.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The seaman bears the risk of having his claim denied if he does not follow the dispute resolution procedure outlined in the POEA SEC.
*   The company bears the risk of potential claims if it does not diligently monitor and assess the seafarer's medical condition within the prescribed timeframes and obtain a clear "fit to work" or disability assessment from the company-designated physician.
