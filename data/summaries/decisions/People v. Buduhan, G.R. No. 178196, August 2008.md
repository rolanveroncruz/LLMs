## Legal Document Summary: People v. Buduhan

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Rudy Buduhan y Bullan and Robert Buduhan y Bullan, G.R. No. 178196, August 6, 2008 (583 Phil. 331).

**Nature:** Automatic review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming with modifications the Regional Trial Court's conviction of the accused-appellants for Robbery with Homicide (Art. 294(1), RPC) and Homicide (Art. 249, RPC). CA modified the original decision to include moral damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Information:** Accused were charged with Robbery with Homicide and Frustrated Homicide for the deaths of Romualde Almeron and Larry Erese and injuries to Fernando Pera and Gilbert Cortez.
*   **Facts:**  Appellants robbed victims at gunpoint in a beerhouse, resulting in the deaths of Almeron and Erese.  Witness Cherry Rose Salazar identified the appellants.  Appellants claimed alibi and presented a negative paraffin test result.
*   **RTC Decision:** Found appellants guilty of Robbery with Homicide (Erese) and Homicide (Almeron), sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua* and indeterminate sentence, respectively. Accused Boyet Ginyang was acquitted.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC decision with modification, adding moral damages (P50,000) to the heirs of both victims.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed conviction for Robbery with Homicide for both deaths (Erese and Almeron). Modified damages to include P50,000 civil indemnity, P50,000 moral damages, and P25,000 temperate damages (Erese) and actual damages to P26,000 (Almeron), and acquitted the appellants from the separate conviction of Homicide for the death of Romualde Almeron.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellants are obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua* for Robbery with Homicide.
*   Appellants are jointly and severally obligated to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, temperate damages, and actual damages to the heirs of the deceased victims.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for Robbery with Homicide based on Art. 294(1) of the RPC
*   Civil liability for damages arising from the criminal act.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Witness Credibility:** Appellants challenged the credibility of the prosecution's main witness, Cherry Rose, citing inconsistencies in her statements during preliminary investigation and trial. The Court, however, favored the trial testimony, citing the lack of proper impeachment procedure.
*   **Illegality of Arrest:** Appellants argued their warrantless arrest was illegal due to lack of personal knowledge by arresting officers. The Court dismissed this, stating that the subsequent conviction was based on admissible testimonial evidence, not "fruits of the poisonous tree."
*   **Paraffin Test:**  Appellants' reliance on negative paraffin test results was deemed insufficient, as the forensic chemist stated the test is merely corroborative and influenced by external factors.
*   **Conspiracy:** The Court found evidence of conspiracy in the appellant's actions, supporting their joint liability.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** Erroneous conviction by the lower courts for Homicide (Art. 249, RPC) was corrected. Since death occurred on occasion of the robbery, it falls under Robbery with Homicide and separate conviction for homicide is erroneous.
*   **Damages:** Award of actual damages by the lower court was reduced to the amount proven with receipts. Award of exemplary damages was deleted due to the absence of proven aggravating circumstances.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC):
    *   Art. 294(1) (Robbery with Homicide)
    *   Art. 249 (Homicide)
    *   Art. 63 (Rules for application of indivisible penalties)
    *   Art. 29 (Deduction of preventive imprisonment)
*   Revised Rules on Evidence: Section 13, Rule 132 (Impeachment of witness)

**Case Law:**

*   *People v. Mateo* (re: intermediate review by Court of Appeals)
*   *People v. Villanueva* (re: award of temperate damages)
*   *People v. Salazar* (re: legality of arrest and admissibility of evidence)
* Other cases cited on the elements of Robbery with Homicide, conspiracy, alibi, and witness credibility.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for Robbery with Homicide, clarifying the elements and addressing the concerns raised regarding witness credibility, legality of arrest, and the weight of scientific evidence. The Court modified the award of damages to align with established precedents and acquitted the appellants from the separate conviction of Homicide for the death of Romualde Almeron.
