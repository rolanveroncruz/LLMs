## Legal Document Summary: Gabriel v. Petron Corporation (G.R. No. 194575)

This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the CA's denial of a Motion for Extension to file a Petition for Certiorari, which sought to overturn an NLRC decision reversing a Labor Arbiter's ruling of constructive dismissal against Petron. The Supreme Court ultimately DENIED the petition, upholding the CA's denial based on procedural grounds.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Constructive Dismissal:**  Gabriel alleged constructive dismissal due to harassment following a complaint by a supervisor's goddaughter (Quiwa). He claims the company interpreted all his actions as violations of company rules and regulations.
*   **Job Assignment/Promotion:** Contention exists as to whether Gabriel's assignment as QMS Coordinator was a promotion (Labor Arbiter's finding) or a lateral transfer (Petron's and NLRC's position). Key point: no increase in salary or benefits.
*   **Alleged Harassment:** Gabriel claims harassment arose from the Quiwa complaint, manifesting in scrutiny of his actions.
*   **Company Policy Violations:** Petron cited Gabriel's alleged unauthorized use of company resources and offering competing training services as President of Gabriel Consultancy Services.
*   **Procedural Issue:** The central issue before the Supreme Court is the CA's denial of Gabriel's Motion for Extension to file a Petition for Certiorari before the CA.  This hinged on the strict application of Rule 65, Section 4, as amended by A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC, prohibiting extensions.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petron:**  Potentially liable for constructive dismissal, back wages, separation pay, and damages if the original Labor Arbiter decision had been upheld.
*   **Gabriel:**  Obligation to adhere to company policies and rules, and to file pleadings within prescribed deadlines.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Bar:** The CA denied the motion for extension and was upheld by the Supreme Court. This means the substance of Gabriel's claims against Petron cannot be addressed.
*   **Loss of Substantive Claim:**  Gabriel loses the opportunity to have the merits of his constructive dismissal claim reviewed.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** governs Petitions for Review on Certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Rule 65, Section 4, Rules of Court (as amended by A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC):**  Concerns certiorari petitions; importantly, it doesn't allow for extensions of time to file.
*   **Article 229 of the Labor Code:** States NLRC decisions are final and executory after 10 calendar days, but does not explicitly eliminate certiorari as a remedy.
*   **St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC, 356 Phil. 811 (1998):** Established that a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 is the proper remedy for judicial review of NLRC decisions.
*   **Montoya v. Transmed Manila Corporation, 613 Phil. 696 (2009):** SC's scope of review in labor cases via certiorari is limited to determining whether the CA correctly found grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC.
*   **Laguna Metts Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 594 SCRA 139, July 27, 2009:**  Cited by the CA in denying the motion for extension based on the prohibition of extensions under the amended Rule 65.
*   **Labao v. Flores, 649 Phil. 213-225 (2010):**  Outlines exceptions to the strict application of procedural rules, but these were deemed inapplicable in Gabriel's case.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Classification of Job Assignment:**  The disagreement over whether Gabriel's assignment as QMS Coordinator was a promotion or lateral transfer. This hinges on the interpretation of "promotion" without a corresponding increase in pay or benefits.
*   **"Just Cause" for Termination:**  The legitimacy of the company's basis for issuing notices of violation based on the complaint of a supervisor's goddaughter (Quiwa) and alleged proprietary information violations.
*   **Application of Procedural Rules:** Gabriel's case rested upon a sympathetic reading of procedural rules. This was not ultimately successful, because the procedural rules were strictly applied.
