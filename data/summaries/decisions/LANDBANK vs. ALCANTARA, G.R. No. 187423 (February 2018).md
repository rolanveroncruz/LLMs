## Legal Document Summary: *Landbank of the Philippines v. Edna Mayo Alcantara*

**Case:** G.R. No. 187423, February 28, 2018

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP)
*   **Respondents:** Edna Mayo Alcantara and Heirs of Cristy Mayo Alcantara

**Subject Matter:** Determination of just compensation for agricultural land acquired under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) per R.A. No. 6657.

**Key Provisions and Rulings:**

*   **Land Acquisition:** DAR issued a Notice of Land Valuation and Acquisition in 1998 for 22.6762 hectares of land owned by Respondents in Tiaong, Quezon.
*   **Initial Valuation:** LBP valued the land at P1,210,252.96 based on DAR Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended by A.O. No. 11, Series of 1994.  This amount was deposited.
*   **Respondents' Protest:** Respondents contested the valuation, seeking P2,267,620.00 based on fair market value.
*   **DARAB Decision:** DARAB upheld LBP's valuation.
*   **SAC Decision:** The Regional Trial Court (RTC) acting as the Special Agrarian Court (SAC) ruled in favor of the Respondents, setting aside LBP's valuation and fixing just compensation at P2,267,600.00 based on fair market value, plus interest from the date of the notice of land valuation. The SAC reasoned that the land was no longer primarily productive as agricultural land, citing conversion to subdivision as the land was being sold at P30-40/sqm.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the SAC's ruling on the amount of just compensation but modified the ruling on the payment of interest: 12% interest per annum shall only be imposed on the deficiency.
*   **SC Ruling:** Reversed and set aside CA and SAC decisions. Remanded the case to the SAC for re-determination of just compensation *strictly* in accordance with Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 and DAR A.O. No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended by A.O. No. 11, Series of 1994, and in consonance with prevailing jurisprudence.
*   SAC has to conduct summary proceedings to ascertain if the data used by LBP was gathered in 1998 or within a proximate data-gathering period prior thereto.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **LBP:** Obligation to pay just compensation as determined by the SAC, based on the prescribed formula and factors. Ordered to pay interest on the deficiency.
*   **Respondents:** Obligation to accept just compensation as determined by the SAC, subject to applicable legal remedies.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Deviation from DAR Formula:** The SAC's rejection of the DAR formula without adequate justification is a key area of contention. The Supreme Court emphasized the mandatory application of the DAR basic formula unless justified based on evidence of record.
*   **Land Use Conversion:** The alleged "conversion" of the agricultural land to residential use, which the SAC relied upon, is contentious because there is no record of DAR approval of land use conversion.
*   **Interest Calculation:** The imposition of interest is a risk, especially if there is a delay in the payment of just compensation.
*   **Data Substantiation:** SC orders substantiation of timely data used by LBP for determining land value.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Governs the acquisition and valuation of land under CARP.
*   **Section 17, R.A. No. 6657:** Enumerates the factors to be considered in determining just compensation.
*   **DAR A.O. No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended by A.O. No. 11, Series of 1994:** Sets forth the basic formula for valuation of CARP lands.
*   ***Alfonso v. LBP***: This case is cited and used as the governing guideline for determining Just Compensation
*   ***LBP v. Spouses Banal, LBP v. Celada, LBP v. Luz Lim***: Decisions underscoring that courts should not readily disregard the DAR basic formula.

**Ambiguities and Issues for Further Scrutiny:**

*   **The date of data-gathering:** It is unclear whether the data used by LBP for the valuation was gathered close to the time of the land taking in 1998.
*   **The "conversion" of the land:** There needs to be documentation such as the DAR approval or zoning ordinance. The court cannot rely solely on the municipal assessor's testimony.

**Recommendation:** Conduct detailed review for the remand of the case to the SAC, to ensure that the re-determination of just compensation strictly adheres to Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 and DAR A.O. No. 6, including gathering accurate and timely data. It must be in consonance with relevant jurisprudence, specifically *Alfonso v. LBP*.
