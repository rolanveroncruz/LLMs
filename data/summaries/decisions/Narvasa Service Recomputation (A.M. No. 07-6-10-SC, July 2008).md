**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 07-6-10-SC**

**Subject:** Request for Re-computation of Retirement Benefits of Retired Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Entitlement to Step Increments:**  The court grants re-computation of retirement benefits to include step increments earned under Republic Act No. 6758 (Salary Standardization Law) and CSC-DBM Joint Circulars, even those accrued from January 1, 1990, to January 1, 1999, despite prior resolutions potentially limiting their application (A.M. No. 99-12-01-SC and A.M. No. 02-5-06-SC). The recomputation is based on Basic Monthly Salary (BMS) at SG 32, Step 3.
*   **Inclusion of PERA and ADCOM:** The court confirms the inclusion of Personnel Emergency Relief Allowance (PERA) and Additional Compensation (ADCOM) in the computation of terminal leave pay, citing *Borromeo v. Civil Service Commission*. This is under the principle of liberal interpretation of retirement laws.
*   **Impact of E.O. No. 611:** The court orders the adjustment of the monthly pension to reflect the 10% salary increase authorized under Executive Order (E.O.) No. 611, sourced from the Special Allowance for the Judiciary (SAJ), and a corresponding 10% deduction in the monthly SAJ component, consistent with Sec. 6 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9227.

**Obligations:**

*   **Fiscal Management and Budget Office (FMBO):** FMBO is directed to (1) pay the deficiency in the terminal leave pay, (2) pay the deficiency in accumulated monthly pensions due to step increments and other adjustments, and (3) adjust the monthly pension to reflect the 10% salary increase and SAJ deduction as per E.O. No. 611.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Court recognizes the underpayment in Terminal Leave Pay, and therefore liable to pay this to the ret. CJ.
*   The Court recognizes the underpayment in Monthly Pension, and therefore liable to pay this to the ret. CJ.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Retroactive Application of Step Increments:**  The court's decision to credit step increments earned from 1990-1999 might create a precedent for other retired justices and judges to claim similar re-computations.
*   **SAJ Reduction Mechanism:** The interpretation and implementation of how the 10% salary increase is sourced from the SAJ may be subject to further clarification, especially regarding its impact on future SAJ allocations for incumbent justices and judges.
*   **Conflicting Resolutions:** The OAS's initial interpretation of A.M. No. 99-12-01-SC and A.M. No. 02-5-06-SC, excluding retired justices from step increment benefits, highlights a potential area of ambiguity that future claimants might exploit.
*   **"Liberal Interpretation":** The reliance on the "liberal interpretation of retirement laws" principle could be challenged if future cases involve significantly different factual scenarios, potentially creating inconsistencies.
