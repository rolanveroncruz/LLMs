## Legal Document Summary: *Lourdes A. Sable vs. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 177961

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) affirmance of the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) denial of Lourdes Sable's application for probation after her conviction for Falsification of Public Documents under Article 172(1) in relation to Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code. The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately denied the petition.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction:** Sable was convicted of Falsification of Public Documents for falsifying an Extrajudicial Declaration of Heirs with Waiver of Rights and Partition Agreement, leading to the fraudulent transfer of land titles.
*   **Sentence:** The RTC sentenced her to an indeterminate penalty of four (4) years, two (2) months, and one (1) day to six (6) years.
*   **Probation Law (PD 968, as amended):** Sec. 4 mandates that probation applications must be filed "within the period for perfecting an appeal" and that "no application for probation shall be entertained or granted if the defendant has perfected the appeal from the judgment of conviction." The filing of the application shall be deemed a waiver of the right to appeal.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **Timely Appeal:** Obligation to file a Notice of Appeal within fifteen (15) days from promulgation of the judgment or notice of final order appealed from (Rule 122, Sec. 6 of the Rules of Court).
*   **Probation Application Timing:** Obligation to apply for probation within the period for perfecting an appeal.
*   **Electing Remedies:** Defendant must choose either to appeal or apply for probation; they are mutually exclusive.

**Liabilities:**

*   Sable is liable for the sentence imposed by the RTC due to the finality of the conviction and the ineligibility for probation.
*   Potential liability for damages arising from the fraudulent transfer of land titles, though not explicitly mentioned in this document.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Untimely Probation Application:** Sable's probation application was filed almost eight months after the judgment became final, violating Sec. 4 of PD 968.
*   **Attempted Appeal and Probation:** Sable first filed a Notice of Appeal and then attempted to apply for probation, violating the principle of mutually exclusive remedies. *Francisco v. Court of Appeals*, 313 Phil. 241 (1995), and *Llamado v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 84850, 29 June 1989, 174 SCRA 566, 572-573.
*   **Counsel's Negligence:** The Court held that counsel's negligence in failing to properly monitor the case and deadlines is binding upon the client. *Negros Stevedoring Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. L-36003, 21 June 1988, 162 SCRA 371, 375.
*   **Improper Mode of Appeal:** Sable incorrectly filed a Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65) instead of a Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Francisco v. Court of Appeals, 313 Phil. 241 (1995):** Emphasizes that probation essentially rejects appeals and encourages an otherwise eligible convict to immediately admit his liability.
*   **Palo v. Militante, G.R. No. 76100, 18 April 1990, 184 SCRA 395, 400:** Stresses that application for probation must be filed within the period for perfecting an appeal to encourage reform and rehabilitation.
*   **Llamado v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 84850, 29 June 1989, 174 SCRA 566, 572-573; Bala v. Martinez, G.R. No. 67301, 29 January 1990, 181 SCRA 459, 468-469:**  Prevailing jurisprudence treats appeal and probation as mutually exclusive remedies.
*   **Negros Stevedoring Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-36003, 21 June 1988, 162 SCRA 371, 375.:** Law firms have a duty to implement a system to ensure lawyers promptly receive notices and pleadings.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   There are no significantly ambiguous or contentious clauses within the document itself. The contention lies in the application of established legal principles (Probation Law, Rules of Court) to the specific facts of the case, specifically the timing of Sable's appeal and probation application.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the denial of Sable's probation application due to her failure to comply with the requirements of the Probation Law and the Rules of Court. The Court emphasized the mandatory nature of filing the probation application within the appeal period and the mutually exclusive nature of the remedies of appeal and probation. Sable's counsel's negligence was deemed binding upon her, and the improper mode of appeal further undermined her position. The case highlights the importance of adhering to procedural rules and making informed decisions regarding available legal remedies.
