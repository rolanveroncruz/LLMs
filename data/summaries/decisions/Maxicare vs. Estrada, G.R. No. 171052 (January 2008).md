**Case Summary: Philippine Health-Care Providers, Inc. (Maxicare) vs. Carmela Estrada/Cara Health Services (G.R. No. 171052, January 28, 2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision which affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision in favor of the Respondent, Estrada, in an action for breach of contract and damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Letter-Agreement (February 16, 1991):** Formal appointment of Estrada as Maxicare's "General Agent."
    *   Commission Structure: 15-18% on individual/family/group accounts; 2.5-10% on tailored fit plans; 10% on standard plans of commissionable amount on corporate accounts.
*   **Service Agreement (November 28, 1991) between Maxicare and MERALCO:** Direct agreement, excluding Estrada from negotiations.  Estrada seeks commissions based on total premium payments received by Maxicare.

**Obligations:**

*   **Maxicare:** Alleged obligation to pay Estrada commission based on MERALCO account premiums.
*   **Estrada:** Performance of functions and duties as specified in the letter-agreement.

**Liabilities:**

*   The RTC and CA found Maxicare liable for breach of contract. Maxicare was ordered to pay actual damages equivalent to 10% of the P20,169,335.00 total premiums paid by MERALCO from 1991-1996, plus legal interest from the filing of the complaint, and attorney's fees of P100,000.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Breach of Contract:** Maxicare's direct negotiation with MERALCO and failure to pay commissions to Estrada constituted a breach of the agency agreement.
*   **Damages:** Maxicare faces significant financial liability for unpaid commissions, interest, and attorney's fees.
*   **Reputational Risk:** Allegations of bad faith and misrepresentation by Maxicare's counsel may damage the company's reputation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Manotok Brothers, Inc. v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 94753, April 7, 1993, 221 SCRA 224):** The Court cited this case in determining that Estrada was the "efficient procuring cause" of the contract between Maxicare and Meralco.
*   **Tan v. Gullas (441 Phil. 622 (2002):** This case was used to define the role of a broker and distinguish it from an agent.
*   **Atillo III v. Court of Appeals (334 Phil. 546 (1997):** Maxicare erroneously cited this case to support their assertion that Estrada made an admission in her pleadings.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Only questions of law may be raised under a petition for review on certiorari.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 129, Section 4:** Discusses judicial admissions and their exceptions.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 132, Section 34:** Discusses offer of evidence and its purpose.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 10, Rule 10.02:** A reminder to Maxicare's counsel against misrepresenting the contents of a document.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Commission Structure Interpretation:**  Maxicare argued that commissions were only payable upon Estrada's collection and remittance of dues, which she could not do because they negotiated directly. The court rejected this argument, stating Maxicare was trying to avoid paying a legitimate commission.
*   **Termination/Renewal of Agency Agreement:** Maxicare claimed the agency agreement was not renewed after one year. The court did not explicitly rule on this, focusing on Estrada being the "efficient procuring cause" regardless of the contract's status.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision, finding Estrada to be the "efficient procuring cause" of the MERALCO-Maxicare contract. Maxicare's attempt to avoid paying commissions based on a narrow interpretation of the agency agreement and purported admissions was rejected. This case highlights the importance of recognizing and compensating brokers who facilitate business relationships, even when the principal attempts to circumvent their involvement in final negotiations. The potential for further legal action on the contract with MERALCO exists for both parties.
