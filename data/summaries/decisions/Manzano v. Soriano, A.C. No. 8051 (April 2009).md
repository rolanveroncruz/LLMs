**Case:** *Ederlinda K. Manzano vs. Atty. Santiago C. Soriano*, A.C. No. 8051 (2009)

**Summary:** This is a disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Santiago C. Soriano initiated by his former client, Ederlinda K. Manzano, for dishonesty (misappropriation) and misrepresentation/unauthorized notarial acts. The Supreme Court ultimately disbarred Atty. Soriano.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Misappropriation of Client Funds (Canon 16, Code of Professional Responsibility):** The Court found Atty. Soriano guilty of misappropriating PhP 50,000 intended for his client, Manzano, from a sale he facilitated between a debtor, Barela, and himself. He was entrusted with these funds and failed to remit them, instead converting them to his own use. This violates Canon 16, requiring lawyers to hold client funds in trust.
*   **Unauthorized Notarial Acts (Violation of Notarial Law):** The Court also found that Atty. Soriano acted as a notary public without a commission for several years (1996, 2005, 2006, and 2007), notarizing several documents. The act of a lawyer of notarizing documents without the commission is considered malpractice, and falsification of public documents. (*Zoreta v. Simpliciano*, A.C. No. 6492).
*   **Dishonesty and Deceit:** Atty. Soriano attempted to conceal his misappropriation through a deed of sale showing he purchased the property from Barela's mother for a lesser amount. He notarized this document himself while lacking the commission.
*   **Failure to Defend Himself:** Atty. Soriano failed to adequately participate in the IBP proceedings, failing to appear and submit required documents despite notice.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Duty to Hold Client Funds in Trust:** A lawyer must not convert client funds to their own use and must promptly remit funds belonging to the client.
*   **Duty to Obey the Law:** This includes the Notarial Law. Lawyers must not engage in unauthorized notarial practice.
*   **Duty of Candor and Honesty:** Lawyers must be honest in their dealings with clients, the court, and the public.
*   **Duty to Uphold the Integrity of the Legal Profession:** Acts reflecting dishonesty or deceit damage the reputation of the bar.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Disbarment:** Based on the seriousness of the misconduct (misappropriation, unauthorized notarial acts, and attempts to conceal these acts), the Supreme Court ordered the disbarment of Atty. Soriano.
*   **Potential Criminal Liability:** While not explicitly addressed in this document, the acts of falsification and misappropriation could also expose Atty. Soriano to criminal charges. An estafa case was filed against him, though its outcome is not detailed.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Outcome of Estafa Case:** While mentioned, the final disposition of the estafa case filed against Atty. Soriano is not clear in this decision.
*   **Civil Liability:**  The decision focuses on the administrative penalties. It doesn't explicitly address whether Manzano pursued or could pursue separate civil action to recover the misappropriated funds.
*   **Reliance on Evidence:** The decision relies heavily on the IBP's findings, which, in turn, are based on the evidence presented by the complainant.  A challenge to the factual basis of the findings would be difficult given the Supreme Court's deference to the IBP.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility:** Specifically, Canon 1 and Canon 16 (holding client funds in trust). Rule 1.01 states duty to obey, respect, and uphold the law and legal processes.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 138, Sec. 27:** Grounds for suspension or disbarment.
*   ***Zoreta v. Simpliciano*, A.C. No. 6492:** Discusses the importance of notarization and the consequences of unauthorized notarial acts.
