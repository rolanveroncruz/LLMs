**Case Summary: Boston Finance and Investment Corporation v. Judge Candelario V. Gonzalez (A.M. No. RTJ-18-2520, October 9, 2018)**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Judge Gonzalez for undue delay and gross ignorance of the law.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Case:** Civil Case No. 10-27-MY, "Estate of Danilo Y. Uy v. Boston Finance," involved a Petition for Injunction/TRO to prevent foreclosure.
*   **Respondent's Actions:**
    *   Issued a "cease and desist" order (effectively a TRO) *without* specifying its duration or stating justification, contravening Rule 58, Section 5 of the Rules of Court regarding TROs.
    *   Failed to resolve pending incidents (motion to lift the cease and desist order, motion to dismiss) for a prolonged period, despite motions from Boston Finance.
    *   Archived the case, citing amicable settlement negotiations, but exceeding the 90-day limit under Administrative Circular No. 7-A-92.
*   **Complainant's Arguments:** Undue delay and violation of A.M. No. 99-10-05-0 (Procedure in Extrajudicial or Judicial Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgages) due to failure to resolve pending incidents.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Good faith belief in amicable settlement and participation of Complainant in the MTCC case.

**Findings and Obligations:**

*   **Gross Ignorance of Law:** The Court found that Judge Gonzalez demonstrably failed to apply basic tenets of procedure regarding the issuance of TROs violating Section 5 of Rule 58. Good faith does not excuse ignorance of the law.
*   **Undue Delay:**  Failure to resolve pending incidents promptly violated Sections 3 and 5, Canon 6 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, requiring judges to perform duties efficiently and promptly.
*   **Penalties:** Fined P30,000 for gross ignorance and P11,000 for undue delay.  Stern warning issued.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 58, Section 5, Rules of Court:** Governs issuance of TROs; defines duration and required hearings.
*   **A.M. No. 99-10-05-0:** Concerns foreclosure procedures.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 7-A-92:** Guidelines for archiving cases.
*   **Sections 3 and 5, Canon 6 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary:** Mandates efficient and prompt performance of judicial duties.
*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court:** Discipline of Judges.
*   **Section 6 and 11, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution:** The source of the Supreme Court's administrative authority over all courts and the personnel thereof.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Conflicting Jurisprudence:** The court acknowledges conflicting prior decisions regarding whether multiple administrative charges should result in separate penalties for each offense versus a single penalty for the most serious offense, with others considered aggravating circumstances.
*   **Resolution of Conflict:** The Court resolves the conflict of jurisprudence, and establishes that for Judges and Justices of lower courts, there will be separate penalties for each offense under Rule 140. For other court personnel, where the Code of Conduct of Court Personnel is applicable, the old rule would be applied where there is a single penalty for the most serious offense.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Repeat Offenses:**  Judge warned that further violations will result in more severe penalties.
*   **Impact on Lower Courts:** The ruling clarifies how penalties are imposed for Judges and Justices and Court Personnel for administrative charges, potentially altering how future cases are handled and reducing any current confusion.
