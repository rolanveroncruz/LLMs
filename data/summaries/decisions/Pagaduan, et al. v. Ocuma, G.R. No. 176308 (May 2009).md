**Legal Document Summary: *Pagaduan vs. Ocuma, G.R. No. 176308, May 8, 2009***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision reversing a RTC decision for reconveyance.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over an 8,754 square meter portion of land originally part of a larger parcel under C.T. No. 14, which was later subdivided.
*   **Competing Claims:**
    *   **Petitioners (Pagaduans):** Heirs of Agaton Pagaduan, claim ownership through an unregistered sale from Eugenia Reyes in 1961.  Assert possession and argue that the action is not barred by prescription.
    *   **Respondents (Ocumas):** Claim ownership through a subsequent registered sale from Eugenia Reyes in 1962, resulting in TCT No. T-5425 (later subdivided into TCT Nos. T-37165 and T-37166).
*   **Double Sale (Art. 1544, Civil Code):**  The Supreme Court (SC) identified the core legal issue as a double sale by Eugenia Reyes. The SC applied Art. 1544 to determine which party has superior right.
*   **Reconveyance:** The RTC originally ordered the Ocumas to reconvey the disputed 8,754 square meter portion to the Pagaduans. The SC reinstated this decision.

**Liabilities & Judgement:**

*   The SC ruled in favor of the Petitioners (Pagaduans).
*   The Ocumas are liable to reconvey the 8,754 square meter portion to the Pagaduans.  The SC affirmed the RTC award of attorney's fees (P15,000) and litigation expenses (P5,000) to the Pagaduans.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1544, Civil Code:** Governing double sales of immovable property. Critical for determining ownership based on good faith possession/registration.
*   **Article 1141, Civil Code** Prescription of Real Actions over Immovables
*   **Article 1456, Civil Code:** Implied trusts - determined not to be applicable
*   **Berico v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 96306:**  Referenced to define actual and constructive fraud in the context of implied trusts.
*   **Consolidated Rural Bank (Cagayan Valley), Inc., v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 132161:** Cites the principle that a certificate of title cannot be used to protect a usurper.
*   **Gabriel v. Spouses Mabanta, 447 Phil. 717:** Explains the two-fold requirements for the second buyer to invoke Article 1544.
*   **Ulep v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125254:** Stresses that knowledge of the first sale blackens prior registration with bad faith.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **Good Faith:**  Crucial element in double sale cases. The SC found the Ocumas acted in bad faith due to prior knowledge of the sale to Agaton Pagaduan. *Risk*: Proving "bad faith" relies heavily on evidence demonstrating the Ocumas' awareness of the prior sale.
*   **Prescription:** CA held action for reconveyance had prescribed. SC reversed, finding it was filed within the prescriptive period after TCT was issued in bad faith. *Risk:* Determining when the prescriptive period begins to run depends on proving bad faith in the TCT issuance.
*   **Nature of Possession:** The CA considered whether petitioners took possession, which factored into the prescription analysis. The SC implicitly confirmed Agaton Pagaduan took possession, bolstering their claim to superior right under Art. 1544.
