Okay, here's a summary of the provided legal document, formatted in markdown, with key provisions, obligations, liabilities, potential risks, and relevant legal references:

**Case:** *Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation (FBDC) vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue* (G.R. No. 158885 & G.R. No. 170680, April 2, 2009)

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision resolving consolidated petitions for review regarding the denial of FBDC's claim for transitional input tax credits (TITC) on its real property inventory under the old National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) after the implementation of R.A. 7716, the Expanded Value-Added Tax (EVAT) law, and subsequently for tax refund.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 105 of the Old NIRC (as amended by E.O. 273):** Allows a person becoming liable to VAT, or electing to be VAT-registered, a TITC equivalent to 8% of the beginning inventory of goods, materials, and supplies or the actual VAT paid, whichever is higher, creditable against output tax.
*   **R.A. 7716 (EVAT Law):** Amended Section 100 of the Old NIRC to include "real properties held primarily for sale to customers or held for lease in the ordinary course of trade or business" within the definition of "goods or properties" subject to VAT. This is the triggering event that makes the sale of FBDC's real properties VATable.
*   **Revenue Regulation (RR) 7-95, Section 4.105-1 & Transitory Provisions:** Restricts TITC for real estate dealers to the value of *improvements* (buildings, roads, drainage) constructed *after* January 1, 1988 (the effective date of E.O. 273), and not the underlying land value.  This is the core point of contention.
*   **R.A. 8424 (Tax Reform Act of 1997):** Renumbered Section 105 (Old NIRC) to Section 111 and introduced the concept of "presumptive input tax credits" with Section 111(b) for sardines, mackerel and milk, and in manufacturing refined sugar and cooking oil, and public works contractors.

**Factual Context:**

*   FBDC acquired a vast tract of land (Fort Bonifacio) from the Philippine government *prior* to the effectivity of R.A. 7716 (i.e., VAT-free sale transaction).
*   After R.A. 7716 took effect, FBDC began selling lots in Fort Bonifacio, incurring output VAT obligations.
*   FBDC claimed TITC on its beginning inventory, including the value of the land.
*   BIR disallowed the TITC on the land value, citing RR 7-95 which limits it to improvements.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Deficiency VAT Assessment (G.R. No. 158885):** BIR assessed FBDC for deficiency VAT for the 4th quarter of 1996 due to disallowance of TITC on land.
*   **Denial of Tax Refund Claim (G.R. No. 170680):** BIR denied FBDC's claim for a refund of overpaid VAT for the 3rd quarter of 1997 because the BIR did not allow the value of the land to be included in the TIC.

**Contentious Clauses & Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "goods, materials, and supplies" in Section 105 of the Old NIRC:** Does it include the land itself for real estate dealers, or only improvements? The key argument centers on whether RR 7-95's limitation is a valid interpretation of the statute.
*   **Validity of RR 7-95, Section 4.105-1:** Petitioner argues that it unduly restricts Section 105 of the NIRC by excluding the value of the land from the base for calculating the TITC, arguing that the term "goods" as provided by the law included properties held primarily for sale. Does this revenue regulation overstep its authority by legislating rather than implementing?

*   **Republic Act No. 9010**
*   **Republic Act No. 9238**
*   **Republic Act No. 9337 (Reformed Value-Added Tax Law)**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The meaning of the "presumptive input tax"**: Is it a tax that is statutorily presumed to have been paid and that taxpayers need not show that taxes were previously paid on its inventory of land.
*   **Whether the 8% transitional input tax applies only to improvements on land, but not on the land itself**: Petitioner asserts that there is nothing in Section 105 which states that the 8% transitional input tax credit may be based only on the improvements on the land.

**Summary of Ruling:**

The Supreme Court *granted* the petitions, reversing the CTA and Court of Appeals. The SC held that RR 7-95, Section 4.105-1, is invalid because it unduly restricts the scope of Section 105 of the Old NIRC. The court reasoned that when real estate transactions were made subject to VAT, no amendment was made to provide a differentiated treatment as regards the TITC with respect to real properties or real estate dealers. The High court ruled that Section 105 may not be interpreted in such a way as to restrict its application in the case of real estate dealers only to the improvements on the real property belonging to their beginning inventory, and not the entire real property itself.

**Potential Arguments for FBDC**

*   The phrase "goods, materials, and supplies" under Section 105 is to be construed according to Section 100.
*   That no previous business tax, whether in the form of sales tax or VAT, was paid by petitioner on its purchase of land from the national government.
*   That even if the national government did not paid the value-added tax to the land, what is important is that petitioner may avail of the transitional input tax credit provided by law notwithstanding that its purchase of the lands within Fort Bonifacio from the government was not subject to value-added tax.

**Potential Arguments for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue**

*   Section 4.105-1 of RR 7-95 finds its basis in Section 105 which provides that input tax is allowed on the taxpayer's "beginning inventory of goods, materials and supplies."
*   That petitioner is not entitled to claim input VAT on the purchase of the land against its output VAT liability as there was no existing law when the sale happened that imposed a tax.
*   That the 8% transitional input tax applies only to improvements on land, but not on the land itself because the land itself was not subject to VAT or any input tax prior to RA 7716, the land then could not be considered part of the beginning inventory under Section 105.
