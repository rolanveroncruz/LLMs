**Case Summary: *Union of Filipro Employees v. Nestlé Philippines, Inc.* (G.R. Nos. 158930-31 & 158944-45, March 03, 2008)**

**Nature:** Resolution on Motions for Reconsideration and Clarification of a prior Supreme Court Decision regarding a labor dispute between Union of Filipro Employees (UFE-DFA-KMU) and Nestlé Philippines, Inc. concerning CBA negotiations.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Unfair Labor Practice (ULP):** The Union alleged Nestlé committed ULP by setting a precondition to bargaining, specifically refusing to include the Retirement Plan in CBA negotiations. The SC denied this claim, finding no evidence of bad faith by Nestlé. Good faith is presumed, and the Union failed to present substantial evidence to overcome this presumption ( *Capitol Medical Center, Inc. v. Meris*). The duty to bargain doesn't compel agreement. Adamant insistence on a position, even to impasse, doesn't establish bad faith (*Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation Employees Union v. National Labor Relations Commission*). Mere allegation of bad faith is insufficient.

*   **Scope of DOLE Secretary's Jurisdiction:** The SC affirmed the Secretary of Labor's authority under Article 263(g) of the Labor Code to assume jurisdiction over the entire labor dispute, not just the ground rules of CBA negotiations. The power extends to issues "necessarily involved in the dispute" (Article 263(g), Labor Code). The Secretary is not limited to the issues raised in the initial notice of strike. *Secretary of the DOLE's assumption of jurisdiction allows resolution of all incidental questions to the labor dispute presented before it*.

*   **Retirement Plan:** The SC affirmed the Court of Appeals' ruling that the Retirement Plan is a valid issue for collective bargaining, but remanded the issue to the DOLE Secretary for proper disposition. Nestle interprets the order to negotiate retirement benefits voluntarily with the employees. Court rejects Nestle's interpretation, since the DOLOE Secretary has already assumed jurisdiction, the retirement benefits should be remanded to the Secretary for a proper disposition.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Nestlé:** Obligated to bargain in good faith, but not obligated to concede on specific issues.
*   **UFE-DFA-KMU:** Obligated to present substantial evidence to support ULP claims.
*   **Both Parties:** Required to participate in proceedings before the DOLE Secretary.
*   *Duty to bargain collectively* (Articles 252 and 253 of the Labor Code).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Protracted Litigation:** The dispute has been ongoing. Further delays in the DOLE proceedings are possible.
*   **Enforcement of DOLE Order:** Any subsequent order from the DOLE Secretary regarding the Retirement Plan will be binding and subject to enforcement. The specific terms of the DOLE order present the greatest area of potential risk.
*   **Ambiguity in Prior Agreements:** The claim that eight out of nine bargaining units agreed to treat the retirement plan as unilaterally granted might be subject to dispute and would be a key factual issue before the DOLE Secretary.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 263(g) of the Labor Code:** Authority of DOLE Secretary to assume jurisdiction.
*   **Articles 252 and 253 of the Labor Code:** Meaning of duty to bargain collectively.
*   *Capitol Medical Center, Inc. v. Meris, G.R. No. 155098, 16 September 2005*
*   *Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation Employees Union v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 125038, 6 November 1997*

**Conclusion:**

This resolution clarifies that the Retirement Plan is a valid issue for bargaining. The case is remanded to the DOLE Secretary, who has broad authority to resolve the dispute. While the ULP claim was rejected, Nestlé remains obligated to bargain in good faith. The potential risks lie in the terms of the future DOLE order and its enforceability.
