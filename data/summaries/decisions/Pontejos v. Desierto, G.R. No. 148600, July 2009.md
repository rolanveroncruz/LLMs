## Legal Document Summary: *Pontejos v. Desierto and Aquino*, G.R. NO. 148600 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which upheld the Ombudsman's decision finding Atty. Pontejos guilty of Grave Misconduct and dismissing him from service.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Finding of Grave Misconduct:** The Ombudsman found Atty. Pontejos guilty of grave misconduct based on evidence that he demanded and received P100,000 in exchange for a favorable decision in HLURB Case No. 9817.
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service as the penalty for Grave Misconduct under the Civil Service Law and the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 (Section 22, Rule XIV).
*   **Grant of Immunity to Atos:** The Ombudsman granted immunity from criminal prosecution to Carmencita Atos, a key witness, under Section 17 of R.A. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act).
*   **Preventive Suspension:** The Ombudsman placed Atty. Pontejos under preventive suspension for six months without pay.

**Obligations:**

*   As a public officer, Atty. Pontejos had the obligation to adhere to a high standard of ethics in public service, as mandated by Article XI, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative liability for grave misconduct.
*   Potential criminal liability for Estafa, Direct Bribery and Unauthorized Practice of Profession in violation of R.A. 6713 which are separate cases that stemmed from the same facts.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Collateral Estoppel/Law of the Case:** The Supreme Court already ruled on related issues in *Pontejos v. Office of the Ombudsman* (G.R. Nos. 158613-614), specifically on the Ombudsman's authority to grant immunity to a witness. This ruling constitutes the "law of the case" and binds the parties on the already adjudicated questions of law.
*   **Finality of Administrative Findings:** Factual findings of the Ombudsman, when supported by substantial evidence, are generally conclusive and not disturbed by the courts.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act), Section 17:** Grants the Ombudsman the power to grant immunity from criminal prosecution.
*   **1987 Constitution, Article XI, Section 1:** Mandates high ethical standards for public officers.
*   **Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987, Section 22, Rule XIV:** Prescribes dismissal as the penalty for grave misconduct.
*   **Pontejos v. Office of the Ombudsman, G.R. Nos. 158613-614 (2006):**  Previous case involving the same parties and facts regarding criminal liability.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 17, Section 3:** Applied suppletorily, regarding dismissal due to plaintiff's fault (failure to prosecute) â€“ deemed inapplicable here.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Due Process:** Petitioner argued he was denied due process due to the absence of Aquino in hearings. The court held that due process in administrative proceedings doesn't require trial-type proceedings and that the opportunity to be heard was sufficient.
*   **Grant of Immunity:**  Pontejos argued that Atos' immunity was improperly granted and in violation of his rights. The court held that the Ombudsman did not gravely abuse its discretion, especially because the criminal cases were only being filed, which triggers the prosecutorial authority to chose who to discharge as state witness.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision upholding the Ombudsman's finding of grave misconduct against Atty. Pontejos, based on substantial evidence of bribery. Pontejos' arguments regarding lack of due process, the Ombudsman's alleged ill motives, and the improper grant of immunity to Atos were rejected, citing the prior Supreme Court decision on related criminal cases. He was found guilty of demanding money to give a favorable ruling in HLURB Case No. 9817 and dismissed from service as the penalty for that offense.
