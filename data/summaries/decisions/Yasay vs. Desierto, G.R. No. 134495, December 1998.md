## Legal Document Summary: Yasay v. Desierto

**Case:** *Perfecto R. Yasay, Jr. v. Honorable Ombudsman Aniano A. Desierto and the Fact-Finding and Investigation Bureau* (G.R. No. 134495, December 28, 1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, challenging the Ombudsman's order for preventive suspension and seeking dismissal of administrative charges.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction of the Ombudsman:** Petitioner argues the Ombudsman lacked jurisdiction, claiming the case involved a private condominium dispute, not an exercise of governmental function. The Court disagreed, holding that as SEC Chairman acting as President of SEC Building Condominium Corporation (SBCC) is inseparable, making his actions within Ombudsman's purview under R.A. No. 6770.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Petitioner contends grave abuse of discretion in giving due course to the administrative charges. The Court refused to re-evaluate the evidence, stating it's a function of the Ombudsman and outside the scope of a certiorari proceeding. Cites Section 14 of R.A. No. 6770 regarding appellate jurisdiction of decisions of Ombudsman.
*   **Preventive Suspension:** Petitioner assails the preventive suspension order. The Court upheld the Ombudsman's power to suspend under R.A. No. 6770, Section 24, where the evidence of guilt is strong, and the charges involve dishonesty, oppression, grave misconduct, or neglect in the performance of duty.
    *   **Extension of Suspension:** The Court *set aside* the Ombudsman's order extending the preventive suspension. While R.A. No. 6770 allows a preventive suspension, the Court referenced Rule III, Section 9 of the Ombudsman's own Rules of Procedure, which dictates automatic reinstatement if the investigation isn't concluded within the initial period, unless the delay is caused by the respondent. The Court held that the Petitioner's request for a formal investigation is not a "delay" under Section 9.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** The Court noted the failure of Petitioner to first file a Motion for Reconsideration with the Ombudsman. The Court noted that failure to file such motion is fatal.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Violation of Sec. 3(e) was alleged, concerning causing undue injury through bad faith or gross negligence in official functions.
*   **R.A. No. 6770 (Ombudsman Act):** Provided the basis for the Ombudsman's jurisdiction, investigative powers, and authority to impose preventive suspension.

**Case Law:**

*   **Buenaseda v. Flavier, 226 SCRA 645 (1993); Lastimosa v. Vasquez, 243 SCRA 497 (1995):** Used in the context of the assessment of evidence and strong evidence of guilt standard for preventive suspension.
*   **Alonzo v. Capulong, 244 SCRA 80 (1995)**
*   **Pimentel v. Gartichorena, 208 SCRA 122 (1992)**
*   **Lacson v. Roque, 92 Phil. 450 (1953):** For the immediate executory nature of a preliminary step in an administrative investigation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "delay" under Rule III, Section 9 of the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman:** The disagreement regarding the definition of "delay" caused by the respondent in determining if an extension to the preventive suspension is proper.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Petitioner remains subject to administrative investigation and potential penalties (including dismissal) if found guilty of the charges. The extension of the preventive suspension was erroneous, but the underlying charges remain.
*   **Criminal Liability:** The complaint-affidavit also included charges of Estafa under the Revised Penal Code and violation of Sec. 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019, though the petition focuses on the administrative aspects.
*   **Procedural Risks:** Failure to exhaust administrative remedies by filing a motion for reconsideration initially jeopardized the petition.

**Summary of Holding:**

The Supreme Court *dismissed* the petition challenging the Ombudsman's order for preventive suspension and seeking dismissal of the administrative case. However, the Court *set aside* the Ombudsman's order *extending* the period of preventive suspension, finding it unwarranted under the Office of the Ombudsmanâ€™s own Rules of Procedure.
