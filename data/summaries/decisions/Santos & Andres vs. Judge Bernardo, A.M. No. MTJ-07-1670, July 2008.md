**Case:** *Atty. Roderick M. Santos and Alexander Andres vs. Judge Lauro Bernardo* (A.M. No. MTJ-07-1670)

**Summary:**

This is an administrative case against Judge Lauro Bernardo for alleged impropriety, manifest bias and partiality, grave abuse of discretion, and gross ignorance of the law/procedure related to Criminal Case No. 06-004, "People of the Philippines v. Atty. Roderick M. Santos and Boyet Andres."  The Supreme Court found Judge Bernardo guilty of gross ignorance of the law and basic rules of procedure.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Impropriety:** Allegation of using government resources for personal convenience by allowing his girlfriend (later wife) to use his chambers. Based on Presado v. Genova, Complainants asserted the act of respondent judge constitutes serious misconduct.
*   **Manifest Bias & Partiality:** Accusation of allowing the filing of Criminal Case No. 06-004 based on a grudge and hearsay evidence, and undue haste in processing the case, particularly signing the complaint, affidavit and subpoena on the same day.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion & Unfaithfulness to the Law:**  Failure to conduct a preliminary investigation in Crim. Case No. 06-004, a violation of Rule 112 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure (Rules), which requires it for offenses with penalties of at least four years, two months, and one day and instead referring the case to the Executive Judge of Bulacan for its raffle to another MTC Judge. The penalty for Grave Coercion being six years, a preliminary investigation was necessary. Complainants maintain that the criminal complaint was allowed to be immediately entered in the criminal docket converting it into a criminal case by a mere stroke of the clerk of court's pen.
*   **Judge Bernardo's Defense:** Claimed impropriety was due to his wife's necessity for his health and her own business management. He denied bias, stating his signature on the complaint was only for administering the oath. He argued a preliminary investigation was not required for Grave Coercion. Argued that Sec. 3 (a), Rule 112 does not apply and referred to Sec. 3, Rule 110 instead.
*   **OCA Finding:** Found Judge Bernardo administratively liable for gross ignorance of the law and recommended a fine.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Judge found guilty of gross ignorance of the law and basic rules of procedure.
*   Fined P20,000.
*   Stern warning against repetition of similar acts.
*   Implicit reminder of the obligation to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.
*   Obligation to conduct preliminary investigations when the penalty prescribed by law is at least four years, two months and one day per Rule 112.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Further administrative sanctions for future similar conduct.
*   Potential for civil liability if the actions caused damage to the complainants.
*   Possible impeachment proceedings for continued violation of duties.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 2.01, Code of Judicial Conduct:** Duty to maintain proper decorum.
*   **Rule 112, Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Governing preliminary investigations. Specifically, Sections 1 (formerly 9), 3 (a), and 8 (b).
*   **Section 3, Rule 110:** Institution of criminal actions.
*   **San Agustin v. People, G.R. No. 158211, August 31, 2004:** On determining the need for preliminary investigation based on the imposable penalty for the crime *charged* in the complaint. The OCA correctly applied San Agustin v. People.
*   **A.M. No. 05-8-26-SC:** Removed the authority of MTC/MCTC judges to conduct preliminary investigations (effective October 3, 2005).
*   **Administrative Circulars:** No. 3-92, No. 01-99, No. 09-99 relating to proper use of court facilities and decorum.
*   **New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary (A.M. No. 03-05-01-SC):** Obligations to avoid impropriety.
*   **Presado v. Genova, [1] A.M. No. RTJ 91-657, June 21, 1993, 223 SCRA 489.**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Application of Rule 112:**  Dispute over whether Grave Coercion required preliminary investigation, focusing on the penalty imposable.
*   **"Preliminary Hearing":** The court notes the use of this term is a "non-existent procedure" in the Rules.
*   **Judge's wife's presence in chambers:** Whether it constituted impropriety.
*   **Date judge should have referred the complaint:** The complaint of Dr. Yanga against herein complainants was filed on January 3, 2006, respondent was already without authority to conduct preliminary investigation since effective October 3, 2005.

**Note:** The judge's defense regarding the interpretation of Rule 112 concerning preliminary investigation requirements was rejected, demonstrating a failure to correctly apply fundamental procedural rules. This, combined with the outdated authority to conduct a preliminary investigation created the grounds for the ruling against Judge Bernardo.
