Okay, here's a summary of the provided legal document for a lawyer:

**Case:** *C-E Construction Corporation vs. National Labor Relations Commission and Raymundo Hernandez* (G.R. No. 180188, March 25, 2009)

**Summary:**

This case involves a petition by C-E Construction Corporation ("CECC") contesting the NLRC and Court of Appeals' decisions upholding the Labor Arbiter's finding of illegal dismissal of Raymundo Hernandez, a project employee turned regular employee, and the subsequent computation of backwages.  The Supreme Court ultimately denied CECC's petition, affirming the lower courts' rulings.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The core issue is whether Hernandez was illegally dismissed. The Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and ultimately the Supreme Court, found in favor of Hernandez, determining the dismissal was illegal. The Supreme Court affirmed the finality of judgment on the matter of illegal dismissal.
*   **Reinstatement and Backwages:** CECC was ordered to reinstate Hernandez and pay backwages. The point of contention is the extent of the backwages.
*   **Project Employee vs. Regular Employee:** Hernandez's employment contract stipulated co-terminus employment with a project. The Labor Arbiter and NLRC determined that Hernandez became a regular employee despite the project employment contract. While the CA mentioned Hernandez was a project employee, the CA affirmed without modification the NLRC decision. The SC emphasized that the dispositive portion is what matters for the writ of execution.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Monetary Liability:** CECC is liable for backwages, as computed by the Labor Arbiter in its January 28, 2002 order (as affirmed by the NLRC), covering the period from illegal dismissal up to actual reinstatement.
*   **Reinstatement:** CECC has a continuing obligation to reinstate Hernandez to his former position without loss of seniority rights.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Contempt:** Failure to comply with the final and executory judgment regarding reinstatement and payment of backwages could expose CECC to contempt proceedings.
*   **Accruing Backwages:** As long as reinstatement is not fulfilled, the backwages continue to accrue, increasing CECC's financial liability.
*   **Appeal Based on Order of Execution is no longer legally feasible: The Supreme Court has made it clear that the final ruling should not be modified directly or indirectly, and that an appeal based on an order of execution is not legally feasible.**

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The decision cites precedent establishing the finality and immutability of judgments ([26],[27]), except for clerical errors. *Aboitiz Shipping Employees Association v. Trajano*, 348 Phil. 910, 915 (1997).
*   The decision invokes jurisprudence regarding the enforceability of the dispositive portion of a decision ([22],[23]) vs. obiter dicta found within the body of the decision. *Ayala Corporation v. Rosa-Diana Realty and Development Corporation*, 400 Phil. 511, 521 (2000).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The primary area of contention revolved around whether Hernandez was a project employee or a regular employee at the time of dismissal and, consequently, the period covered by the backwages.
*   The CA mentioned in its discussion that Hernandez was a project employee but the statement appears only in the body of the decision, not in the dispositive portion.
*   CECC raised arguments about deducting potential earnings from the backwages calculation and the lack of a formal execution order, but these arguments were ultimately rejected.

**Advice:**

CECC is bound by the final and executory judgment. Attempts to further litigate the matter, particularly regarding the computation of backwages based on the project employment argument, are unlikely to succeed given the Supreme Court's ruling. Immediate compliance with the order of reinstatement and payment of the backwages is recommended to avoid further penalties and legal complications.
