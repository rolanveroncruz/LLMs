## Legal Document Summary: *Carlos Gaudencio M. Mañalac vs. Hernan E. Bidan*

**Case:** A.M. No. P-18-3875, October 03, 2018 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 16-4577-P)

**Parties:**
*   **Complainant:** Carlos Gaudencio M. Mañalac (on behalf of Philippine One Investment (SPY-AMC), Inc. ("PI One"))
*   **Respondent:** Hernan E. Bidan, Sheriff IV, Regional Trial Court, Branch 53, Bacolod City

**Subject Matter:** Administrative complaint against Sheriff Bidan for gross misconduct, grave abuse of authority, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service in implementing a Writ of Execution. This stems from the execution of a writ in Commercial Court Case No. 05-057 (rehabilitation of Medical Associates Diagnostics Center, Inc. (MADCI)) affecting property owned by PI One, which was acquired through foreclosure.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Allegation:** Sheriff Bidan illegally took possession of PI One's property ("subject lot") without proper notice, while the property was under *custodia legis* due to PI One's rehabilitation proceedings in RTC Makati (SP Case No. M-6682) under RA 9182 (Special Purpose Vehicle Law of 2002). The Makati RTC issued a Stay Order covering the subject lot.
*   **Sheriff's Defense:** Acted within official duties, relying on a Bacolod RTC Branch 53 Order dated May 5, 2016, that voided the foreclosure and ordered PI One to restore possession to MADCI. He claims ministerial duty to execute the writ in good faith.
*   **OCA Finding:** Sheriff should have served a copy of the writ on PI One and given them a reasonable opportunity to comply before executing it. Immediate taking of possession without prior notice to PI One’s counsel violated PI One’s due process rights.
*   **Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court found the Sheriff **Guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty**. He failed to comply with Section 10(c), Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which requires demanding peaceful vacation within three (3) working days after service of the writ.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Sheriff Bidan:** Obligation to serve a copy of the writ and provide a three-day notice period before executing a writ of restitution of real property (Section 10(c), Rule 39, Rules of Court). Liability for simple neglect of duty.
*   **PI One:** Originally held an obligation to comply with the Bacolod RTC order to return possession to MADCI.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Notice to Counsel:** The decision emphasizes that notice must be given to the client (PI One) and not to the counsel.
*   **Ministerial Duty vs. Due Process:** The decision reconciles the ministerial duty of a sheriff to execute a writ with the requirement to observe due process by providing proper notice.
*   **Good Faith Defense:** Although the sheriff claimed good faith, his failure to provide the required notice constituted a violation of procedure.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 10(c), Rule 39, Rules of Court:** Mandates the three-day notice requirement for restitution of real property.
*   **Calaunan v. Madolaria, 657 Phil. 9 (2011):** Failure to observe Section 10(c) constitutes simple neglect of duty.
*   **Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS):** Governing the administrative penalty imposed.
*   **Sabijon v. De Juan, 752 Phil. 110, 122 (2015):** Reiterates the ministerial duty of a sheriff.
*   **Republic Act No. 9182 (Special Purpose Vehicle Law of 2002):** Identifies PI One as a special purpose vehicle.

**Penalty:**

*   Fine equivalent to one (1) month and one (1) day of Sheriff Bidan's salary, computed at the time the decision becomes final and executory.

**Conclusion:**

The case clarifies the procedural requirements for sheriffs executing writs of restitution of real property, particularly the mandatory three-day notice period. Failure to comply, even absent malice, constitutes simple neglect of duty, warranting administrative sanctions. The decision balances the ministerial duty of a sheriff with the fundamental right to due process.
