**Legal Document Summary: *Oriental Tin Can Labor Union v. Secretary of Labor and Employment; Oriental Tin Can and Metal Sheet Manufacturing Co., Inc. v. Hon. Bienvenido E. Laguesma*** (G.R. Nos. 116751 & 116779, August 28, 1998)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for certiorari assailing the Undersecretary of Labor's resolution ordering a certification election.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner (G.R. No. 116751):** Oriental Tin Can Labor Union (OTCLU) - incumbent bargaining agent.
*   **Petitioner (G.R. No. 116779):** Oriental Tin Can and Metal Sheet Manufacturing Co., Inc. (the Company).
*   **Respondent:** Secretary of Labor and Employment (represented by Undersecretary Laguesma), Oriental Tin Can Workers Union â€“ Federation of Free Workers (OTCWU-FFW).

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Certification Election:** The central issue is the validity of the Undersecretary's order for a certification election to determine the bargaining representative of the company's employees.
*   **Freedom Period:** The petition for certification election by OTCWU-FFW was filed during the 60-day freedom period before the expiration of the existing CBA between the company and OTCLU, triggering a representation case.
*   **25% Support Requirement:** Dispute over whether OTCWU-FFW met the statutory requirement of having the written consent of at least 25% of the employees in the bargaining unit to file the petition. This includes questions on the validity and voluntariness of employee retractions of support.
*   **CBA Ratification:** The company and OTCLU argued that the subsequent ratification of a new CBA by a majority of employees, including some who initially supported OTCWU-FFW's petition, effectively nullified the petition for certification election.
*   **Employer's Role:** The Company's intervention in opposing the certification election was questioned, given the principle that these elections are primarily an employee affair.

**Obligations:**

*   The Company has an obligation to bargain collectively with the duly certified bargaining representative of its employees (Art. 251, Labor Code).
*   The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) has the duty to enforce labor legislation and regulate relations between workers and employers.

**Liabilities/Potential Risks:**

*   The Company risks being accused of unfair labor practices (establishing a company union) if it unduly interferes with the certification election process.
*   If the certification election is not conducted fairly, the resulting CBA could be challenged.
*   If the strike staged by the OTCWU-FFW is deemed illegal (as suggested by the NLRC's injunction), the striking employees could face disciplinary action.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code (esp. Articles 253, 253-A, 255, 256, 258):** Governing collective bargaining, certification elections, and representation disputes.
*   **Rule V, Book V, Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code (esp. Sections 3 & 4):** Implementing rules on CBA bars and effects of early agreements.

*   **Warren Manufacturing Workers Union v. Bureau of Labor Relations (159 SCRA 387 (1988)):** Premature agreements do not affect a petition for certification election.
*   **Port Workers Union of the Philippines (PWUP) v. Laguesma (207 SCRA 329 (1992)):** Concerns the 25% support signature requirement.

*   **Trade Unions of the Philippines v. Laguesma (233 SCRA 565 (1994)):** No obstacle must be placed to the holding of certification elections.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Voluntariness of Retractions:** The *Sama-samang Pahayag* raises questions about the voluntariness of the initial retractions, shifting the burden to prove voluntariness.
*   **25% Calculation:** The specific number of eligible employees is disputed, affecting whether the 25% threshold was met.
*   **Application of *La Suerte* Ruling:** The Undersecretary distinguishes the *La Suerte* case, highlighting the factual difference regarding the undisputed nature of withdrawals, which the Court believes to be valid.

**Court Holding:**

Both petitions for certiorari are dismissed. The Supreme Court upholds the Undersecretary's order for a certification election, emphasizing the importance of employee free choice and adherence to the statutory process. The Court specifically notes the Company's improper interference.
