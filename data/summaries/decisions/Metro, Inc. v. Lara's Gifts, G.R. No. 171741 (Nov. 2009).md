## Legal Document Summary: *Metro, Inc. v. Lara's Gifts and Decors, Inc.*

**Case:** *Metro, Inc. v. Lara's Gifts and Decors, Inc.*, G.R. No. 171741, November 27, 2009 (621 Phil. 162).

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of the Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order discharging a writ of preliminary attachment.

**Key Issue:** Whether the writ of attachment was improperly issued, allowing its discharge *without* the requirement of a counter-bond.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) ruled that the writ of attachment was *properly* issued based on allegations of fraud related to the inception and performance of the agreement between the parties. Therefore, the writ can only be discharged upon the posting of a counter-bond as per Section 12, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court.

**Facts:**
*   Lara's Gifts and Decors, Inc. (LGD) sued Metro, Inc. for sum of money and damages based on an agreement ("2001 Agreement") where LGD would endorse purchase orders to Metro, Inc. for a commission.
*   LGD alleged Metro, Inc. defrauded them by failing to remit commissions and transacting directly with LGD's foreign buyer (Target).
*   RTC initially granted LGD's application for a writ of preliminary attachment against Metro, Inc.'s assets based on these fraud allegations (Section 1(d), Rule 57).
*   RTC later discharged the writ, finding insufficient evidence of fraud.
*   CA reversed, holding that because the ground for attachment (fraud) was also the core of LGD's cause of action, the writ could only be lifted by posting a counter-bond.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**
*   **Section 1(d), Rule 57 of the Rules of Court:** Grounds for attachment, specifically related to fraud in contracting the debt or incurring the obligation.
*   **Section 12, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court:** Discharge of attachment *upon giving counter-bond*.  This section is crucial.
*   **Section 13, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court:** Discharge of attachment on *other grounds*, specifically when improperly or irregularly issued. This section is *not* applicable in this case.
*   **"2001 Agreement":**  The alleged contract requiring Metro, Inc. to pay LGD a 15% commission. Validity and admissibility (authentication under Rules on Electronic Evidence) were contested by Metro, Inc. but ultimately not decisive to the SC ruling.

**Liabilities:**
*   **Metro, Inc.:**  Potentially liable for the unpaid commissions and damages if the underlying fraud claim is proven. The attachment serves as security for this potential judgment.

**Potential Risks:**
*   **For Metro, Inc.:**  Their assets remain attached unless a counter-bond is posted. Failure to defend against the fraud claim could lead to a significant monetary judgment.
*   **For Lara's Gift and Decors, Inc.:**  If the case fails to prove fraud, they risk liability for damages arising from the wrongful attachment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **Rule 57 of the Rules of Court:** Governing preliminary attachment.
*   **Liberty Insurance Corporation v. Court of Appeals:** Reiterates that fraudulent intent must be shown to sustain an attachment on fraud grounds.
*   **Chuidian v. Sandiganbayan:** Reinforces the rule that when the ground for attachment is also the cause of action, a counter-bond is the only means of discharging the writ (absent improper issuance).
*   **FCY Construction Group, Inc. v. Court of Appeals** Reinforces the rule that when the ground for attachment is also the cause of action, a counter-bond is the only means of discharging the writ (absent improper issuance).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Sufficiency of Allegations of Fraud:** Metro, Inc. argued the amended complaint lacked specific acts of fraud.  The SC found the allegation of direct dealing with the foreign buyer, despite the exclusive agreement, sufficient.  The SC didn't explicitly determine what specific conduct constitutes sufficient allegation of fraud; this remains subject to interpretation.

**Legal Strategy Implication:**
* Metro, Inc. will need to evaluate the strength of their defense on the fraud claim. If weak, posting a counter-bond to release the attached assets may be more advantageous than continuing to litigate the attachment issue.
* Metro, Inc. may want to challenge the amount of the counter bond required if it can be shown to exceed the damages sought or that the value of the attached property is less than the value of the bond required.
