**Case Summary: Chong v. Dela Cruz, G.R. No. 184948 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Resolution on a Motion for Reconsideration of a dismissed petition for certiorari filed under Rule 65, assailing Joint Orders of the Department of Justice (DOJ) which denied petitioners' motions for postponement and remand in I.S. Nos. 2008-650, 2008-117, 2008-152, and 154.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied the Motion for Reconsideration, affirming the dismissal of the original petition for certiorari.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Procedural Deficiencies:** The original petition was dismissed due to non-compliance with procedural rules under Rule 65 in relation to Rules 46 and 56 of the Rules of Court. Specifically, the failure to state material dates of receipt of the assailed orders and the lack of legible certified true copies of the assailed orders.
*   **Hierarchy of Courts:** The SC emphasized the violation of the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. Petitioners directly sought relief from the SC instead of first resorting to the Court of Appeals (CA).
*   **Certiorari as an Extraordinary Remedy:** The court reiterated that certiorari is an extraordinary remedy requiring strict adherence to procedural rules. The SC emphasized that the decision to accept a petition for certiorari is discretionary.
*   **Grounds for Certiorari:** While the CA has jurisdiction to review resolutions issued by the DOJ Secretary through certiorari under Rule 65, such review is limited solely to grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction (citing *Alcaraz v. Gonzales*).
*   **Role of the Supreme Court:** The SC affirmed its role as a court of last resort. Direct invocation of its original jurisdiction is only warranted in exceptional cases involving public welfare, public policy, broader interests of justice, patent nullities, or where appeal is inappropriate (citing *People v. Cuaresma* and *Gelidon v. De la Rama*).

**Potential Risks and Considerations:**

*   **Dismissal on Procedural Grounds:** The petitioners' failure to comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 65 proved fatal to their case. This highlights the importance of meticulous attention to detail in preparing petitions for certiorari.
*   **Limited Scope of Review:** The CA's power of review is limited to grave abuse of discretion by the Secretary of Justice. Factual or legal errors that do not rise to the level of grave abuse of discretion are unlikely to be grounds for relief.
*   **Finality of DOJ Decision:** Absent a successful certiorari petition, the DOJ's Joint Orders stand. The petitioners' motions for postponement and remand remain denied. The case can proceed based on the DOJ's decision.
