**Case Summary: *Presidential Commission on Good Government vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al.*, G.R. No. 195962 (April 18, 2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing the Ombudsman's dismissal of a complaint for violation of Section 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG)
*   **Respondents:** Office of the Ombudsman (OMB), Placido L. Mapa, Jr., et al. (former DBP officials and PPRC officers)

**Background:**

The PCGG filed a complaint with the OMB alleging that the respondents violated RA 3019, Section 3(e) and (g), in connection with foreign currency loans granted by the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to the Philippine Pigment and Resin Corporation (PPRC) in 1978. PCGG's claim was based on the findings of the Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans, created by Administrative Order No. 13 and Memorandum Order No. 61, issued by President Ramos. The PCGG argued that the loans were behest loans, undercollateralized, and that PPRC was undercapitalized.

**Key Provisions/Allegations:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 3(e):** Causing undue injury to the government or giving unwarranted benefits through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.
*   **RA 3019, Section 3(g):** Entering into a contract or transaction manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the government.
*   **PCGG's Allegations:** The loans were undercollateralized and PPRC was undercapitalized. The loan account was considered a behest loan due to the aforementioned characteristics.
*   **DBP defense:** PPRC project was deserving of financial assistance based on documented reasons. The approval of the foreign currency loans of PPRC by the DBP Board of Governors was a collective act in the exercise of its sound business judgment and was in strict and full compliance with the DBP Charter and all other existing bank policies, rules and regulations.

**OMB Ruling:**

The OMB dismissed the complaint for lack of probable cause. The OMB found that the PCGG failed to sufficiently establish manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence. The OMB also noted that the MO No. 61 (behest loan criteria) cannot be applied retroactively to the 1978 loans.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

Affirmed the OMB's dismissal. The Court held that the PCGG failed to demonstrate the elements of Section 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019. Specifically:

*   **Lack of Proof of Malice:** The PCGG did not prove evident bad faith, manifest partiality, or gross inexcusable negligence. DBP officials are presumed to have exercised sound business judgment.
*   **Retroactive Application:** MO No. 61 cannot be applied retroactively, citing Article 366 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Collateral:** The Court cited *Torres v. Limjap* (56 Phil. 141) and *People's Bank v. Dahican Lumber* (126 Phil. 354) in that it held that mortgages extending to after-acquired property are valid.
*   **Undercapitalization**: PPRC was required to contribute additional equity in terms of cash equity of P2,500,000.00, common stock dividends of P1,200,000.00 and conversion of at least P300,000.00 of advances from stockholders into preferred shares of the company.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Business Judgment Rule:** The Court heavily relies on the presumption of regularity and sound business judgment of the DBP officials. This could be a potential weakness if there were evidence to rebut this presumption, but no such evidence was found by PCGG or OMB.
*   **Fact-Finding:** The dismissal hinges heavily on the OMB's factual finding (affirmed by the Supreme Court) that the loans were not grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government at the *time* of approval. A stronger fact-finding investigation might have yielded a different result.
*   **MO No. 61:** While the Court correctly held that MO No. 61 could not create criminal liability ex post facto, the MO still provided the *definition* of behest loans used in the case. Arguably, it was used to create an implication of criminal liability, regardless of when the order was enacted.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 3(e) and (g) -** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 366:** Crimes are punished under the laws in force at the time of their commission.
*   **Torres v. Limjap, 56 Phil. 141 (1931):** Validated mortgages extending to after-acquired property.
*   **People's Bank and Trust Co. v. Dahican Lumber Company, 126 Phil. 354 (1967):** Affirmed the legality of including after-acquired properties in a mortgage contract.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of the PCGG's complaint due to a lack of probable cause. The Court emphasized that the PCGG failed to adequately demonstrate the elements of the alleged violations of RA 3019. The decision highlights the importance of concrete evidence of malice, improper motive, or gross negligence to overcome the presumption of regularity and sound business judgment of public officials. The ruling prevents retroactive application of MO 61 to establish criminal liability.
