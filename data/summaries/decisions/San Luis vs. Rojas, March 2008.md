**Case Summary: *San Luis vs. Rojas*, G.R. No. 159127, March 3, 2008**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing Court of Appeals (CA) Resolutions that dismissed Petitioner's (San Luis) prior Petition for Certiorari due to procedural defects.  The underlying issue is the propriety of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) Order allowing a non-resident foreign corporation (Berdex) to take depositions upon written interrogatories of its witnesses residing abroad to prove an oral contract.

**Facts:**

*   Berdex (a U.S. corporation) sued San Luis in the RTC for collection of a sum of money, alleging an unpaid loan. Berdex sought to prove this oral agreement via depositions upon written interrogatories of its U.S.-based witnesses.
*   San Luis opposed, arguing that the written interrogatories would prejudice his right to cross-examine effectively and prevent the court from assessing witness credibility. He also contested the validity of the contract itself.
*   The RTC granted Berdex's motion. The CA initially dismissed San Luis's certiorari petition on technical grounds (procedural deficiencies: missing affidavit of service, blurred annexes).

**Issues:**

1.  Did the CA commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing San Luis's Petition for Certiorari on mere technicalities?
2.  Did the RTC commit grave abuse of discretion in allowing Berdex to prove an oral contract through depositions on written interrogatories of witnesses taken outside the Philippines?

**Holding:**

1.  Yes, the Supreme Court found the CA did commit grave abuse of discretion. The SC reversed the CA rulings and set them aside.
2.  No, the RTC did not commit grave abuse of discretion.

**Rationale:**

*   **Procedural Issues:** The SC held that the CA erred in focusing on technicalities. Substantial compliance with procedural rules is sufficient. The procedural lapses were not fatal given the surrounding circumstances.
*   **Depositions:** Citing Rule 23, Section 1 of the Rules of Court (formerly Rule 24), the SC emphasized that it contains no restriction as to who can avail of deposition-taking, finding that allowing Berdex to take depositions upon written interrogatories was permissible under the Rules of Court, citing *Dasmariñas Garments, Inc. v. Reyes*, G.R. No. 108229, August 24, 1993.
*   **Right to Cross-Examination:** The SC found San Luis was still afforded the right to submit cross interrogatories.
*   **Oral Contract:** SC found the existence of an oral contract did not preclude the opportunity of deposition taking.
*   **Admissibility vs. Weight:** The SC distinguished between admissibility of evidence and its probative weight. Even if the deposition is admissible, its weight will be determined at trial.
*   **No Merit:** San Luis was accorded the opportunity to cross-examine under Section 25, Rule 23 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Premature argument:** The issue of sanctions for perjury and enforceability of claims against a foreign corporation were deemed premature.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Special Civil Action for Certiorari. Used to correct errors of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Rule 23, Sections 1 & 4, Rules of Court:** Deposition-taking. Permits depositions to be taken of any person, including those residing outside the Philippines, under certain conditions. Section 4(c)(2) allows deposition if the witness is out of the country.
*   **Rule 23, Section 25, Rules of Court:** Cross-examination opportunity under the process.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Appeal by Certiorari to the Supreme Court from decisions of the Court of Appeals.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Dasmariñas Garments, Inc. v. Reyes*, G.R. No. 108229, August 24, 1993:  This case supports the admissibility of depositions of witnesses in foreign jurisdictions, in lieu of oral examination in court under certain circumstances. This case was heavily relied upon for justification.
*   *Donato v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 129638, December 8, 2003: Discussed the propriety of certiorari petitions.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Weight of Evidence:** While the SC allowed the deposition, the actual *weight* it will be given at trial is still uncertain. The oral contract may be difficult to prove.
*   **Effective Cross-Examination:** The limitations of written cross-examination compared to live testimony remain a practical concern.
*   **Enforcement:** The issue of enforcing a judgment against a foreign corporation with no assets in the Philippines is a lingering risk, though deemed premature by the Court.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ruled that the foreign corporation, Berdex, could present evidence through deposition by written interrogatories. The Court determined the foreign corporation was within their right to present evidence in accordance with Rule 23 of the Rules of Court. The Court reiterated that the issue of credibility and evidence weight are not the basis of the ruling, but will be determined on a later date.

I hope this is helpful.
