## Legal Document Summary: *Panado v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 127936

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari concerning a contempt of court charge.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals committed reversible error in finding that private respondents (Hernando Cortes et al.) could not be held in contempt of court for allegedly violating a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) issued by the CA.

**Background:**
*   This case involves a long-standing land dispute litigated across multiple cases: forcible entry (Civil Case 1142 - MCTC favoring Cortes), recovery of land (Civil Case 3951 - RTC dismissed for failure to prosecute), and quieting of title (Civil Case 4187 - RTC dismissed on res judicata and forum shopping, affirmed by CA in CA-G.R. CV No. 32625).
*   The CA's decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 32625 became final and executory.
*   The RTC issued a Writ of Execution in Civil Case No. 4187 to enforce dismissal of the amended complaint and to collect costs against Petitioners
*   Petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari in the CA challenging the Writ of Execution in Civil Case No. 4187. The CA issued a TRO against enforcing the Writ of Execution.
*   Petitioners then filed a Motion to cite private respondents in contempt for allegedly violating the TRO by entering the disputed property.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, denying the Petition and finding no basis for contempt.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Contempt of Court:** The Court held that the private respondents could not be held in contempt because the TRO was directed at the public respondents (RTC Judge and Sheriff), not the private respondents.  A party cannot be held in contempt for disobeying an order not directed at them. *Pascua v. Heirs of Segundo Simeon, 161 SCRA 1 (1988).*
*   **Scope of TRO:** The TRO only restrained enforcement of the Writ of Execution in the *quieting of title* case (Civil Case 4187).  It did not prohibit the private respondents from entering the property.
*   **Finality of Judgment:** The Court emphasized that the underlying judgment in Civil Case No. 4187 (dismissing the quieting of title action) was final and executory, and could not be collaterally attacked through challenges to the Writ of Execution or arguments about ownership of the land. *In Re Joaquin T. Borromeo, 241 SCRA 405 (1995).*

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Irrelevant Arguments:** The Court explicitly warned Petitioners' counsel against raising irrelevant arguments related to the forcible entry case (Civil Case No. 1142) and the ownership of the property, as those were not properly before the Court in this Petition. The Court viewed this as an attempt to circumvent the final and executory judgment.
*   **Vexatious Litigation:** The Court implied that the Petitioners were engaging in vexatious litigation by attempting to re-litigate settled matters.
*   **Contempt Power Sparingly Used:** The Court reinforced the principle that contempt powers should be exercised sparingly, on the preservative rather than the vindictive principle, to maintain the dignity of the court.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable for costs.
*   Petitioners' counsel was warned against introducing irrelevant and confusing issues in future pleadings.

**Ambiguities:** None explicitly identified, but the core issue revolved around the interpretation of the TRO's scope and to whom it applied.
