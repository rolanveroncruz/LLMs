**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-18-2535**

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against Judge Pepito B. Gellada for gross ignorance of the law and procedure.

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Carlos Gaudencio M. Mañalac, on behalf of Philippine Investment One (SPV-AMC), Inc. (PI One).
*   **Respondent:** Hon. Epito B. Gellada, former Presiding Judge, Branch 53, Regional Trial Court, Bacolod City (RTC Bacolod City Branch 53).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   PI One, as a Special Purpose Vehicle, acquired a non-performing loan from DBP secured by a mortgage from Medical Associates Diagnostic Center Inc. (MADCI).
*   MADCI filed for corporate rehabilitation in RTC Bacolod City Branch 53 (Judge Gellada presiding). Rehabilitation was initially terminated but later revived by Judge Gellada.
*   PI One foreclosed on the mortgage after the initial termination of rehabilitation, consolidated title, and obtained a writ of possession from RTC Kabankalan City Branch 61.
*   **Complainant's Allegations:**
    *   Gross ignorance of the law by Judge Gellada in reviving the terminated rehabilitation proceedings.
    *   Interference with a co-equal court (RTC Kabankalan City Branch 61) by nullifying the foreclosure and ordering restoration of possession to MADCI, despite PI One’s writ of possession.
    *   Granting reliefs (nullification of foreclosure, restoration of possession) not specifically sought in MADCI's pleadings.
    *   Gross ignorance of the law in granting MADCI's ex-parte motion for execution without notice or hearing to PI One.

**Respondent's Defense:**

*   The rehabilitation case was not properly terminated under the Financial Rehabilitation and Insolvency Act of 2010 (FRIA), specifically Section 74, and should have been converted into liquidation proceedings.
*   PI One improperly moved to terminate proceedings instead of seeking conversion to liquidation and immediately foreclosed.
*   The FRIA allows for a Stay Order, and PI One's actions violated FRIA.
*   FRIA empowers courts to issue stay orders that should have prevented the foreclosure by PI One.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Judge Gellada:** Found guilty of gross ignorance of the law and procedure, specifically violation of the principle of immutability of judgment and non-interference with co-equal courts.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **FRIA (Financial Rehabilitation and Insolvency Act of 2010), Section 74:** Termination of Rehabilitation Proceedings.
*   **Rule 2 Sec. 73 of the Financial Rehabilitation Rules of Procedure**
*   **Recto v. Hon. Trocino:** Defines gross ignorance of the law.
*   **Mercado v. Judge Salcedo (Ret.):** Found a judge liable for modifying a final decision.
*   **Atty. Cabili v. Judge Balindong:** Explains the doctrine of judicial stability and non-interference.
*   **Department of Justice v. Judge Mislang:** Defines penalty of gross ignorance.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The applicability and interpretation of FRIA's provisions on termination and liquidation in relation to PI One's foreclosure.
*   Whether the RTC Bacolod City Branch 53 validly retained jurisdiction after the initial termination of rehabilitation proceedings.
*   Whether respondent Judge misinterpreted and misapplied the Financial Rehabilitation Rules when he stated PI ONE’s motion to terminate the rehabilitation proceedings was anchored on Section 27, Rule 4 of the old Rules on Corporate Rehabilitation of 2000 (2000 Rules) which rule later became the Interim Rules on Corporate Rehabilitation of 2008 (2008 Rules).

**OCA Recommendation & Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   OCA found Judge Gellada guilty of gross ignorance of the law.
*   Supreme Court agreed, citing the violation of immutability of judgment and interference with a co-equal court.  A fine of P21,000.00 was imposed, deducted from his retirement benefits, given his compulsory retirement and absence of bad faith.
