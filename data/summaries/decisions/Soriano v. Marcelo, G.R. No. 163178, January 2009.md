**Case Summary: *Hilario P. Soriano v. Ombudsman Simeon V. Marcelo, G.R. No. 163178, January 30, 2009***

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, assailing Ombudsman Orders dismissing a complaint against Manila City Prosecutor Ramon Garcia.

**Facts:** Petitioner Soriano filed a complaint against Garcia for violation of Article 208 of the Revised Penal Code (dereliction of duty) and Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).  The complaint stemmed from Garcia's decision to forward a preliminary investigation (I.S. No. 01F-22547) against Bank Examiner Mely Palad to the Department of Justice (DOJ), citing Soriano's pending administrative complaints against Garcia and Assistant City Prosecutor Balasbas as reason to avoid suspicion of partiality. Soriano argued this referral was a dereliction of duty causing undue delay and injury.

**Ombudsman's Ruling:** Dismissed the complaint for lack of probable cause.  The Ombudsman reasoned that Article 208 requires proof of the underlying crime committed by Palad and malice on Garcia's part, which was not established.  Regarding Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019, the Ombudsman stated that the "undue injury" element requires actual and certain damages capable of pecuniary estimation, which Soriano failed to prove. Referral to DOJ was not malicious.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**
*   **Article 208, Revised Penal Code:**  Penalizes a public officer for maliciously refraining from instituting prosecution for the punishment of law violators or tolerating the commission of offenses.
*   **Section 3(e), R.A. No. 3019:** Penalizes causing undue injury to any party or giving unwarranted benefits through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**
*   **Article 208 Liability:**  The risk of liability under Art. 208 hinges on proof of the underlying offense committed by Palad, Garcia's knowledge of the crime, and his malicious intent to refrain from prosecution.
*   **Section 3(e) Liability:** The risk of liability under Section 3(e) lies on the ability to prove undue injury (akin to actual damages) to the complainant, a causal link between Garcia's actions and the injury, and that Garcia acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence, and the element of giving unwarranted benefit to Palad should also be alleged in the Affidavit-Complaint.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 208:** Dereliction of Duty. *U.S. vs. Mendoza, 23 Phil. 194* - requires proof of underlying offense by the original violator of the law.
*   **R.A. No. 3019, Section 3(e):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
*   **Llorente v. Sandiganbayan, 350 Phil. 820 (1998):** Undue injury must be specified, quantified, and proven to a point of moral certainty, akin to actual damages. Mere distress or financial stress, without specific details or supporting evidence, is insufficient. *Santos v. People G.R. No. 161877, March 23, 2006* -  undue injury is likened to actual damage in civil law.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses and Arguments:**
*   **Undue Injury:**  The primary contentious point is the interpretation of "undue injury" under Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019. The Court emphasizes the need for proof akin to actual damages, requiring quantification and evidentiary support, which Soriano lacked.
*   **Garcia's Motive:** The Court found Garcia's stated reason for the referral (avoiding suspicion) "not completely acceptable," as it would incentivize the filing of administrative cases to force recusals. However, the lack of evidence demonstrating malice or ill will was crucial in dismissing the complaint.
*   **Defective Affidavit-Complaint:** The absence of any statement on unwarranted benefit in the affidavit-complaint.

**Potential Outcomes/Risks:**
*   The Court upheld the Ombudsman's dismissal, finding no grave abuse of discretion.
*   The petitioner bore the burden of proving actual damages and malicious intent, which was not met.
*   While the Court disapproved of Garcia's stated reason for referral, it was insufficient to establish a violation of R.A. 3019 without further evidence of malice or ill will.

**Note:** The filing of administrative cases against Garcia to prompt his recusal may constitute harassment and abuse of process.
