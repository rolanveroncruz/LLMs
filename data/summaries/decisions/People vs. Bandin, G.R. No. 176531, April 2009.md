**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a conviction for rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code. The CA affirmed the RTC decision, and the Supreme Court affirmed with modifications.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Appellant Romeo Bandin was charged with rape committed against AAA, a 16-year-old woman, through force and intimidation on May 21, 1993.
*   **Evidence Presented:** The prosecution presented the victim's testimony identifying the appellant, and medical evidence from Dr. Aziel Diel showing healed lacerations consistent with sexual intercourse. The defense presented an alibi and denial.
*   **Findings of Fact:** The RTC and CA found the victim's testimony credible and positively identified the appellant. The SC affirmed this finding. The SC noted the victim positively identified the Appellant through his voice whom she had known for some time.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion perpetua.
*   **Damages Awarded:** The appellant was ordered to pay the victim P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages, and P30,000 (reduced from P50,000 by the SC) as exemplary damages.
