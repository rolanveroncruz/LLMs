Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Julieta F. Enriquez, Romeo F. Enriquez, and Tita E. Velasco v. Heirs of Florencio F. Enriquez* (G.R. No. 215035, May 27, 2024)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the CA Decision reversing the RTC's decision in a Complaint for Declaration of Nullity and Cancellation of Title and Declaration of Ownership.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA committed reversible error in denying petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration to remand the case to the RTC for full trial.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reversed the CA decision, and REMANDED the case to the RTC for trial on the merits.

**Summary:**

The case involves a dispute over ownership of three parcels of land (Lot Nos. 3564, 3566, and 3567) originally purchased by Faustino Enriquez, but titled in the name of his son, Florencio. Petitioners (children of Faustino from his second marriage) claim ownership based on a subsequent "Escritura de Venta" from Florencio to them and continuous possession. Respondents (Heirs of Florencio) claim ownership based on a Free Patent and Original Certificate of Title (OCT No. P-3,588) issued in Florencio's name. The RTC initially ruled in favor of the petitioners, declaring them the owners and nullifying the title issued to Florencio's heirs.  The CA reversed, finding the petitioners' evidence insufficient and the respondents' title valid.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Petitioners' Argument:** They claimed Faustino bought the property for them, Florencio acknowledged this via a deed of sale, and they have been in continuous possession.
*   **Respondents' Argument:** Florencio originally cultivated the land. Respondents claimed ownership through a Free Patent and OCT No. P-3,588 for Lot 3564, and tax declarations for the other lots.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Granted the complaint, declaring petitioners as owners, due to Florencio's Escritura de Venta and Affidavit executed in 1952 and 1956. The RTC said that the DENR had no jurisdiction over the subject lots.
*   **CA Ruling:** Reversed the RTC, questioning the validity of petitioners' evidence (unsigned Escritura de Venta, unproven Affidavit) and upholding respondents' title. CA held that Faustino's sale was void because of his Chinese citizenship and no evidence was presented to prove that Ong Yok previously owned the subject lots.
*   **SC Ruling:** The RTC committed grave abuse of discretion by deciding the case on the merits without a full trial. The evidence presented was solely for preliminary injunction purposes and the RTC made findings regarding evidence that the CA later failed to consider. Estoppel doesn't apply given the circumstances, and remanding the case would serve the interest of justice.

**Key Legal Issues and Potential Risks:**

*   **Propriety of Decision Without Full Trial:**  The central legal error was the RTC's premature decision on the merits after hearings limited to the issue of a preliminary injunction. This violates due process, as parties were not given the opportunity to present their full case.
*   **Validity of Title:**  The validity of OCT No. P-3,588 remains in question. If the land was indeed private land prior to the issuance of the free patent, the DENR lacked jurisdiction to grant it.
*   **Evidence of Ownership:** The court will need to evaluate all evidence, including the "Escritura de Venta," affidavits, tax declarations, and Decree No. 702880 issued on April 20, 1931, to determine ownership.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Case Law:**

*   The decision references several cases regarding the nature of preliminary injunctions and the distinction between questions of law and fact.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The *Escritura de Venta* executed by Florencio is contentious. The validity and admissibility of this document will be a crucial point in the trial, with the CA declaring it was unsigned. Also, the genuineness and due execution of the affidavit was not established by the petitioners.

**Liabilities and Obligations:**

*   **RTC Obligation:**  The RTC is now obligated to conduct a full trial on the merits, including a pre-trial conference, presentation of evidence, and determination of all factual and legal issues.
*   **Parties' Obligations:** Both parties will have the obligation to present all relevant evidence to support their claims of ownership.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioners' Risk:** They must prove the authenticity and validity of Florencio's "Escritura de Venta" and that the Escritura de Venta was valid.
*   **Respondents' Risk:** Their title (OCT No. P-3,588) could be invalidated if the land was determined to be private land prior to the free patent.
*   **Prolonged Litigation:** The remand to the RTC will likely result in further appeals and prolonged litigation.

This summary provides a concise overview of the key legal points in the document. A thorough review of the entire record will be necessary to fully assess the strengths and weaknesses of each party's case and develop a litigation strategy.
