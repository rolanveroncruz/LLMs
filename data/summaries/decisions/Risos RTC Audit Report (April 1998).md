## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 97-9-282-RTC

**Case:** Report on Judicial Audit, RTC Branch 27, Lapu-Lapu City (Judge Teodoro K. Risos)

**Issue:**  Administrative liability of Judge Risos for failure to decide cases within the 90-day period and delayed action on other pending cases. Also addresses shortcomings of the Branch Clerk of Court.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Delays in Decision Rendering:** Judge Risos failed to decide several criminal and civil cases within the 90-day period mandated by the Constitution (Art. VIII, Sec. 15(1) and (2)) and the Code of Judicial Conduct (Rule 3.05, Canon 3).
*   **Compliance with Filing and Promulgation:** While Judge Risos eventually decided the cases, there was initial concern regarding proper filing with the Clerk of Court per Section 1, Rule 36 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure and service of decisions per Section 9, Rule 23. Verification with the OIC Clerk of Court later addressed this concern.
*   **Excuses Offered:** Judge Risos cited pressure of work, heart attack, slow transcript turnover, destruction of notes due to typhoon damage, and preference for detention prisoner cases as reasons for the delays.  These were deemed insufficient justification.
*   **Clerk of Court's Failure:** Branch Clerk Atty. Annie Christine B. Patalinghug failed to properly manage court records but her resignation rendered directives against her moot.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Risos:** Obligated to decide cases within 90-day period. Found guilty of **Gross Inefficiency**. Ordered to pay a fine of **₱10,000.00** deductible from retirement benefits.
*   **Branch Clerk:** Duty to maintain accurate and updated records, perform certifications/minutes of hearings.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity Regarding Filing and Service:** Initial ambiguity regarding compliance with filing and service requirements outlined in Rules 36 and 23 could have had further administrative consequences.
*   **Justification for Delays:** Judge Risos's offered justifications were rejected as valid excuses, highlighting the importance of requesting extensions when unable to meet deadlines (re: *Española vs. Panay*). Reliance solely on mitigating circumstances was deemed insufficient.
*   **Administrative Sanction:** The size of the administrative sanction and the decision to only impose a fine, without considering the seriousness of the conduct, is subject to debate. It is crucial to examine similar cases (*Re: Judge Danilo M. Tenerife*) to determine comparable fines for similar conduct to defend the adequacy of the sanction and potentially challenge it.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article VIII, Section 15(1) and (2):** Mandates prompt disposition of cases.
*   **Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3, Rule 3.05:** Emphasizes the need for prompt and expeditious decision-making.
*   **Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 36, Section 1:** Stipulates requirements for judgment writing and filing.
*   **Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23, Section 9:** Mandates personal service or service by registered mail.
*   **Centrum Agri-business Realty Corporation vs. Katalbas-Moscardon, A.M. No. RTJ-92-880:** Highlights the importance of both writing and promulgating decisions.
*   **Report on the Audit and Inventory of Cases in the RTC, Branch 11, Balayan, Batangas, A.M. No. 93-11-1311-RTC:**  Reinforces the principle that delayed justice is justice denied.
*   **Re: Judge Danilo M. Tenerife, A.M. No. 94-5-42-MTC:** Establishes a precedent for fining judges for failure to decide cases within the reglementary period.
*   **Española vs. Panay, etc., A.M. No. RTJ-95-1325:** Duty of the judge to seek time extensions.

**Conclusion:**

The document reveals Judge Risos's administrative liability for gross inefficiency due to prolonged delays in deciding cases. Mitigating factors, such as health issues, were considered, leading to a fine rather than more severe sanctions. Key areas of legal concern revolved around proper procedures for decision filing and promulgation, the insufficiency of the Judge's excuses for the delays, and compliance with judicial deadlines to avoid undermining public trust in the judicial system.
