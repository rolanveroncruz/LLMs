**Case Summary: Associated Labor Unions (ALU) vs. Court of Appeals, et al. (G.R. No. 156882)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision directing the annotation of encumbrances (restrictions on use and reversionary interest) on Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) held by the Societas Verbum Dei (SVD), as stipulated in a 1958 Deed of Sale between the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Palo, Leyte (RCAP) and SVD. The ALU seeks to prevent the annotation.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Sale (1958):** RCAP sold 13 parcels of land to SVD with conditions:
    *   **Educational Purpose:** SVD must use the land for educational purposes, particularly St. Paul's College (later Divine Word University of Tacloban - DWUT).
    *   **Reversionary Right:** If SVD abandons educational and religious work with no foreseeable resumption, the properties revert to RCAP, with the Apostolic Nunciature determining conversion of property rights.
*   **MOA (1997):** Between ALU, DWUT, and RCAP for settlement of labor liabilities (G.R. No. 91915). DWUT agreed to pay ALU PHP 100 million (partly via *dacion en pago* using Imelda Village & San Jose land), in exchange for ALU withdrawing unfair labor practice case against DWUT & RCAP.

**Liabilities & Claims:**

*   **DWUT Liability:** DWUT owes ALU substantial sums due to G.R. No. 91915 (labor case) (amounting to PhP 200 million)
*   **ALU Claims:** ALU asserts a judgment lien over the SVD properties based on the final judgment in G.R. No. 91915 and seeks to enforce it.
*   **RCAP Action:** Filed Cadastral Case No. 95-04-08 to annotate restrictions and reversionary interest on the SVD titles.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Laches:** ALU argues RCAP is barred by laches from seeking annotation due to the 37-year delay.  However, the Court held that the annotation would not be inequitable or prejudicial to any party since the SVD, the property purchaser, did not interpose any objection to the annotation.
*   **Judgment Lien & Preference of Credits:** ALU attempts to invoke Art. 110 of the Labor Code and Arts. 2242-2244 of the Civil Code to establish preference over other creditors.  The Court rejected this argument since there was no bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.
*   **ALU Personality/Standing:** The CA initially considered the ALU not a proper party on appeal, but the Supreme Court addressed the merits of the case regardless.
*   **Conditions in the Deed of Sale:** The deed was not notarized. The Court said that for purposes of validity between the parties, a deed of sale need not be in a public document. With the judicial acquiescence of the SVD to the annotation, the subject matter of the instant case was held to be in order.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529:** Amending and Codifying the Laws Relative to Registration of Property.
*   **Eduarte v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 121038, July 22, 1999, 311 SCRA 18) and related cases:** Applied the principle of laches to bar judicial remedies in the plaintiff's exercise of legal rights.
*   **Article 110 of the Labor Code:** Worker Preference in Case of Bankruptcy.
*   **Articles 2242, 2243, and 2244 of the Civil Code:** Concurrence and Preference of Credits.
*   **Divine Word University of Tacloban v. Secretary of Labor and Employment (G.R. No. 91915):** Establishes the original labor liability of DWUT.
*   **Estate of the Late Encarnacion Vda. de Panlilio v. Dizon (G.R. Nos. 148777 & 157598, October 18, 2007, 536 SCRA 565, 593-594):** Definition of laches.
*   **Tigno v. Aquino (G.R. No. 129416, November 25, 2004, 444 SCRA 61, 76):** On the validity of a deed of sale.

**Ambiguities & Contentions:**

*   The lack of annotation on the TCTs for an extended period created ambiguity regarding the actual ownership and encumbrances.
*   ALU argued that the RCAP sought the annotation to shield assets from satisfying the labor judgment.
*   The interpretation and applicability of the MOA in relation to ALU's claim on the SVD properties.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *denied* ALU's petition and affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision.  The annotation of the restrictions on use and reversionary interest of the RCAP on the SVD titles was ordered.  The ALU's argument of laches and preference of credit failed.
