**Legal Document Summary: People vs. Talib-og, G.R. No. 238112, December 5, 2018 (844 Phil. 1073)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming with modification the RTC's Joint Judgment finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of rape by sexual assault and two counts of statutory rape.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charges:** Four counts of rape filed in separate Informations - two counts of statutory rape (Criminal Case Nos. 12890 and 13001) and two counts of rape by sexual assault (Criminal Case Nos. 13002 and 13003).
*   **Statutory Rape (Cases 12890 & 13001):**  The Supreme Court affirmed the convictions under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(d) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by R.A. No. 8353 ("The Anti-Rape Law of 1997"). Key elements are: (1) victim under 12 years old; (2) accused had carnal knowledge. Victim's testimony deemed credible over the accused's denial.
*   **Rape by Sexual Assault (Cases 13002 & 13003):** The Court affirmed the conviction under Article 266-A, paragraph 2, RPC. Specifically, insertion of accused's finger into the victim's vagina, which amounts to lascivious conduct under Sec. 5(b), Art. III of RA 7610, which provides stronger penalties in cases of sexual abuse.
*   **Penalties:**
    *   Statutory Rape (Cases 12890 & 13001): Reclusion Perpetua, P75,000 civil indemnity, P75,000 moral damages, P75,000 exemplary damages for each count.
    *   Rape by Sexual Assault (Cases 13002 & 13003): Indeterminate sentence of 12 years, 10 months, 21 days to 15 years, 6 months, and 20 days of reclusion temporal, as stated. P30,000 civil indemnity, P30,000 moral damages, P30,000 exemplary damages for each count.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 266-A (as amended by R.A. No. 8353):** Defines statutory rape and rape by sexual assault.
*   **Republic Act No. 7610, Article III, Section 5(b):** "Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act."  Applied due to the victim being a minor, resulting in a higher penalty than the original RTC sentence for rape by sexual assault.
*   **People v. Jugueta (783 Phil. 806 (2016)):** Basis for increasing civil indemnity and moral damages.
*   **People v. Chingh (661 Phil. 208 (2011)):** Established that the penalty under R.A. No. 7610, Article III, Section 5(b) should apply when the victim of rape by sexual assault is a minor.
*   **Ricalde v. People (751 Phil. 793 (2015)):** Applied penalty for an offense under Section S(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 even when accused was charged and convicted of the crime of rape by sexual assault.
*   **People v. Bagsic (G.R. No. 218404, December 13, 2017):** Reiterated the rationale behind the modification and increase of the penalty applicable for rape by sexual assault committed against a minor.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The accused-appellant is obligated to serve the sentences imposed and pay the damages awarded to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Information Deficiencies:**  The Informations in Criminal Case Nos. 13002 and 13003 erroneously designated the crime as "statutory rape." However, the Supreme Court found this not to be a violation of the accused's due process rights because the Informations clearly indicated that the accused "willfully, unlawfully and feloniously insert his right finger into the vagina of AAA, a ten-year old minor, against her will and without her consent."

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision convicting the accused of statutory rape and rape by sexual assault based on the credible testimony of the victim. The Court modified the penalty for rape by sexual assault, applying a higher penalty under R.A. No. 7610 due to the victim's age. The accused bears the obligation to serve the sentences imposed and pay the substantial damages awarded to the victim.
