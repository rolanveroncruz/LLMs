## Legal Document Summary: _Narag v. Manio_, A.M. No. P-08-2579 (2009)

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint â€“ Grave Misconduct, Dishonesty, Conduct Unbecoming a Court Employee.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Facts:** Respondent Maritess Manio, a Court Interpreter, solicited P20,000 from Complainant Odaline Narag, representing it as a down payment for Atty. Mac Paul Soriano's (unauthorized) legal fees for an adoption case. Manio failed to provide the promised services and disappeared, ceasing to report for work.
*   **Findings:** The Supreme Court found Manio guilty of grave misconduct, dishonesty, and conduct unbecoming a court employee. The court explicitly points out that a court employee should exemplify the principle of public office as a public trust.
*   **Penalty:** Considering Manio had already been dismissed in a prior case (`Canlas-Bartolome v. Manio`, A.M. No. P-07-2397), the Court imposed a fine of P20,000, to be deducted from accrued leave credits, and ordered restitution of the P20,000 to the complainant. Failure to do so will subject her to criminal prosecution.

**Obligations:**

*   **Manio:** Obligated to pay a P20,000 fine and restitute P20,000 to Narag.
*   **Employees' Leave Division, OCA:** Obligated to compute Manio's leave credits and deduct the fine.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Manio is administratively liable for grave misconduct, dishonesty, and conduct unbecoming.
*   **Potential Criminal Liability:** Failure to restitute the P20,000 subjects Manio to criminal prosecution.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Non-compliance with Restitution:** Failure to restitute the P20,000 could lead to criminal charges for fraud or estafa.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (Civil Service Rules), Section 52(A)(1) and (3):**  Establishes dismissal as the penalty for the first offense of Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct.
*   **Section 53 of the Civil Service Rules:** Addresses mitigating circumstances but was not applicable here due to Manio's failure to file a comment.
*   **_Canlas-Bartolome v. Manio_, A.M. No. P-07-2397, 4 December 2007, 539 SCRA 333:** A prior case where Manio was dismissed for dishonesty and grave misconduct based on similar facts.
*   **_Adtani v. Manio_, A.M No. P-04-1893, 27 July 2007, 528 SCRA 232:** A prior case where Manio was found guilty of conduct unbecoming a court employee.
*   **_Joson v. Macapagal_, 432 Phil. 980 (2002):** Used to illustrate conduct unbecoming a government employee based on reneging on promises.
*   **OCA v. Cunting, A.M. No. P-04-1917, 10 December 2007, 539 SCRA 494, 512, citing Sibulo v. San Jose, A.M. No. P-05-2088, 11 November 2005, 474 SCRA 464, 471:**  Cited as precedence for the fact that a prior dismissal does not render a current administrative case moot.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the rule expressly prohibiting court personnel from recommending a private attorney (New Code of Judicial Conduct) to the case, given that it took effect after the commission of the complained act. While the court acknowledges this, they use it as a supporting argument, emphasizing the broader principle of propriety.
*   While Manio was dropped from the rolls for AWOL, the resolution points out that this did not absolve her from administrative liability.
