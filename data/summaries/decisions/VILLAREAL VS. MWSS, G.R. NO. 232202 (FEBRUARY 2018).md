## Legal Document Summary - *Villareal v. MWSS* (G.R. No. 232202)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45) assailing the RTC's dismissal of a Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65) related to a Writ of Execution.

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC erred in upholding the MeTC's issuance of a Writ of Execution more than five years after the finality of the judgment.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversed the RTC decision, and set aside the Writ of Execution.  The Court held that the MeTC lacked jurisdiction to issue the writ because it was issued beyond the five-year period allowed under Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 6, Rule 39, Rules of Court:** Judgment may be executed on motion within five years from the date of its entry. After that, it can only be enforced by an independent action.
*   **Entry of Judgment:** Is the same as the date of the finality of judgement.
*   **Timeline:** The RTC decision became final on December 15, 2002. MWSS filed a motion for Writ of Execution on May 17, 2004 (within the 5-year period). The MeTC *granted* the motion on July 28, 2014 and issued the actual Writ of Execution on October 26, 2015.
*   **Obligation of Judgment Creditor:** The judgement creditor has the obligation to ensure that the motion is filed and that the court issues a writ of execution within five years.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **MWSS:** The Writ of Execution is null and void because it was issued beyond the 5-year prescriptive period. MWSS is unable to enforce the RTC judgment via motion. If the statute of limitations of 10 years has not run, MWSS may be able to file an independent action to revive the judgment, although this is risky due to possible defenses based on laches or change in circumstances of the involved parties.
*   **Orlando Villareal:** Successful in quashing the void writ of execution. The obligation to vacate and pay is still present based on the RTC decision.
*   **MeTC:** Issued a void writ of execution, potentially creating liability for damages if any were suffered.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 6, Rules of Court:** Key statutory provision governing execution of judgments.
*   **Republic Act No. 7279 (Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992):**  Orlando initially raised this law but it was deemed inapplicable because he failed to prove he was an "underprivileged and homeless citizen."
*   ***Olongapo City v. Subic Water and Sewerage Co., Inc., 740 Phil. 502 (2014)***: Emphasized that both the motion and the writ of execution must be within 5 years.
*   ***Villeza v. German Management and Services, Inc., et al., 641 Phil. 544 (2010):*** On sleeping on one's rights.
*   ***Yau v. Silverio, Sr., 567 Phil. 493 (2008)*** Stressed that in computing the time limit for enforcing a final judgment, the general rule is that there should not be included the time when execution is stayed.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The attempt by MWSS to argue that Orlando's opposition caused the delay was rejected by the Supreme Court, emphasizing that the delay was due to the MeTC's inaction rather than Orlando's legitimate exercise of his right to file a comment.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision clearly establishes that the five-year period for execution by motion is jurisdictional, and the failure to issue a writ of execution within that period renders the writ void. MWSS must now pursue an independent action to revive the judgment, subject to the statute of limitations and potential defenses.
