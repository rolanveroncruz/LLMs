**Case Summary: *Allied Agri-Business Development Co., Inc. vs. Court of Appeals and Cherry Valley Farms Limited*** (G.R. No. 118438, December 4, 1998)

**Key Issue:** Propriety of a summary judgment based on implied admissions resulting from Allied Agri-Business Development Co., Inc.'s (ALLIED) failure to properly respond to Cherry Valley Farms Limited's (CHERRY VALLEY) Request for Admission.

**Facts:** CHERRY VALLEY, a foreign corporation, sued ALLIED for a sum of money (£51,245.12) representing the unpaid purchase price of duck eggs and ducklings. ALLIED initially denied liability, arguing CHERRY VALLEY lacked the capacity to sue, questioning the amount owed, and disavowing its president's (Quintos) letter acknowledging the debt. CHERRY VALLEY then served a Request for Admission. ALLIED objected, but the trial court ordered compliance. ALLIED failed to timely submit a sworn response. The trial court then granted CHERRY VALLEY's Motion for Summary Judgment based on the implied admissions.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding the summary judgment.

**Key Provisions and Implications:**

*   **Request for Admission (Rule 26, Rules of Court):** This is central to the ruling. ALLIED's failure to timely submit a sworn denial or a detailed explanation of why it couldn't admit or deny the matters in the Request for Admission resulted in the matters being deemed admitted. This effectively established ALLIED's liability. *Motor Service Co. v. Yellow Taxicab Co., 96 Phil. 688 [1955]* cited regarding the purpose and effect of Rule 26.
*   **Summary Judgment:** Properly granted because ALLIED's implied admissions established that no genuine issue of material fact remained for trial. *Walsh v. Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co., 26 F Supp. 556* cited.
*   **Foreign Corporation's Capacity to Sue:** The Court held that ALLIED was estopped from challenging CHERRY VALLEY's capacity to sue because ALLIED had contracted with CHERRY VALLEY. *Georg Gratjahn GMBA & Co. v. Isnani, G.R. No. 109272, 10 August 1994, 235 SCRA 216* and *Communications Materials and Designs, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 102223, 22 August 1996, 260 SCRA 673* cited to the effect that a company entering into a transaction with a foreign company is prevented from using their lack of license to avoid obligations.
*   **Acknowledgment of Debt:** Quintos' letter was deemed an admission of debt by the corporation.

**Obligations:**

*   ALLIED is obligated to pay CHERRY VALLEY £51,245.12 or its peso equivalent at the time of payment, plus legal interest from the filing of the complaint.
*   The original judgment of the trial court to pay CHERRY VALLEY 10% of the total amount due from defendant as attorney’s fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   Monetary liability for the debt, interest, and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Defaults:**  The case highlights the critical importance of complying with procedural rules, particularly Rule 26. Failure to respond properly to a Request for Admission can be fatal to a party's case.
*   **Estoppel:** Engaging in transactions with a foreign corporation, even if unlicensed, can create an estoppel that prevents a party from later challenging that corporation's legal standing to sue.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   The initial dispute over the true amount of the debt and the authorization of Quintos' letter became moot once ALLIED failed to respond to the Request for Admission.
