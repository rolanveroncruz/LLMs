**Case Summary: *People v. Resurreccion*, G.R. No. 186380 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Manuel Resurreccion for violation of Section 15, Article III of Republic Act No. (RA) 6425, as amended by RA 7659 (sale and delivery of *shabu*).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Accused-appellant was charged with selling and delivering 992.9835 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (*shabu*).
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** An NBI buy-bust operation led to the arrest of Resurreccion. SA Vallejo acted as the poseur-buyer, and Resurreccion allegedly sold him the *shabu* in exchange for marked money.
*   **Evidence:** The *shabu* was seized, marked at the NBI office, and tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride by Forensic Chemist Francisco. Traces of fluorescent powder were found on Resurreccion's hands.
*   **Defense:** Resurreccion claimed he was framed and extorted, alleging he was forced to hold a white envelope and was beaten up. His housemaid testified to witnessing his arrest.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Obligation:** To prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused sold the *shabu* and to establish the chain of custody of the evidence.
*   **Accused's Liability:** Found guilty by the RTC and CA of violating Sec. 15, Art. III of RA 6425 and sentenced to reclusion perpetua and a fine of PhP 1,000,000.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The defense challenged the chain of custody, arguing the *shabu* was not immediately marked at the scene of the arrest. The Court acknowledged the significance of preserving integrity and evidentiary value.
    *   ***Issue:*** RA 9165 & its Implementing Rules Section 21 do not explicitly define "immediate marking" or its location. The court cited *People v. Sanchez*, G.R. No. 175832, October 15, 2008 and *People v. Gum-Oyen*, G.R. No. 182231, April 16, 2009
    *   ***Ruling:*** The Court upheld that marking at the police station in the presence of the accused can be sufficient, as demonstrated in  *People v. Cortez*, G.R. No. 183819, July 23, 2009
    *   ***Risk:*** While the Court emphasized preservation of integrity, deviations from strict compliance with procedural requirements could be grounds for challenge, especially regarding the integrity and evidentiary value of seized items.
*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The defense highlighted inconsistencies in the prosecution witnesses' testimonies.
    *   ***Ruling:*** The Court ruled that the inconsistencies were trivial and did not detract from the elements of the offense, citing *People v. Darisan*, G.R. No. 176151, January 30, 2009 and *People v. Encila*, G.R. No. 182419, February 10, 2009. The appellate court's findings are typically sustained.
    *   ***Risk:*** While minor inconsistencies may be overlooked, significant contradictions or inconsistencies related to material facts of the case could undermine the prosecution's credibility.
*   **Defense of Denial/Frame-up:** The Court gave little weight to the defense of denial and the allegation of frame-up, due to the lack of corroborating evidence and failure to overcome the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972), as amended by RA 7659:** Defined the crime and penalties.
*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sec. 21 & Implementing Rules:** Addresses chain of custody requirements.
*   **People v. Sanchez, G.R. No. 175832, October 15, 2008.**
*   **People v. Gum-Oyen, G.R. No. 182231, April 16, 2009.**
*   **People v. Cortez, G.R. No. 183819, July 23, 2009.**
*   **People v. Darisan, G.R. No. 176151, January 30, 2009.**
*   **People v. Encila, G.R. No. 182419, February 10, 2009.**

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court upheld Resurreccion's conviction, finding that the prosecution established the elements of the crime and that the chain of custody, while not perfect, was sufficient to preserve the integrity of the evidence.
