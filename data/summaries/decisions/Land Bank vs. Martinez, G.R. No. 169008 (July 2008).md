## Legal Document Summary: Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Raymunda Martinez (G.R. No. 169008)

**Nature of Document:** Resolution denying Land Bank of the Philippines' (LBP) Motion for Reconsideration and Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration of the August 14, 2007 Decision which affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) dismissal of LBP's petition for certiorari. The core issue involves just compensation for land compulsorily acquired under RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988).

**Key Provisions & Procedural History:**

*   **Compulsory Acquisition:** DAR acquired Raymunda Martinez's 62.5369-hectare land in Romblon under CARP.
*   **Land Valuation Dispute:** LBP offered P1,955,485.60 as just compensation, which Martinez rejected as unjust.
*   **DARAB Proceedings:** Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD) initially determined just compensation to be P12,179,492.50.
*   **SAC Petition:** LBP filed a petition with the Special Agrarian Court (SAC) for the fixing of just compensation.
*   **PARAD Execution Order:** Martinez sought and obtained a writ of execution from the PARAD based on the alleged finality of the DARAB decision. LBP's motion to quash was denied.
*   **CA Petition:** LBP filed a petition for certiorari with the CA assailing the PARAD's resolutions, which was dismissed for forum shopping.
*   **Supreme Court Petition:** LBP filed a petition for review on certiorari with the Supreme Court.

**Key Issues & Court's Rulings:**

1.  **Authority of LBP Legal Department:** The Court initially ruled the LBP's Legal Department required authorization from the OGCC. This point was later addressed with a letter of authority from OGCC, which appears to have been considered in the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration.
2.  **Forum Shopping:** The Court maintained LBP committed forum shopping by simultaneously filing a motion to quash with the PARAD and a petition for certiorari with the CA.
3.  **Finality of PARAD Decision:** The core issue is the finality of the PARAD's decision and the timeliness of LBP's petition to the SAC. The Court ultimately reaffirmed its August 14, 2007 Decision, holding that the petition for fixing just compensation with the SAC must be filed within the 15-day period stated in the DARAB Rules; otherwise, the adjudicator's decision attains finality (citing *Philippine Veterans Bank v. Court of Appeals* and *DARAB v. Lubrica*).
4.  **Conflict with *LBP v. Suntay*:** The Court acknowledged a conflicting ruling in *LBP v. Suntay* (G.R. No. 157903) which stated that the filing of the petition for determination of just compensation was an original action, and did not have to be filed within 15 days. The Court explicitly stated in the present Resolution, for the guidance of the bench and bar, that the *better rule* (stated in *Philippine Veterans Bank*, *Lubrica* and the August 14, 2007 Decision) is that the petition for fixing just compensation MUST be filed with the SAC within the 15-day period stated in the DARAB Rules; otherwise, the adjudicator's decision will attain finality.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **LBP Obligation:** To pay Martinez P12,179,492.50 as just compensation, as ordered by the PARAD, because their Petition for Fixing of Just Compensation at the SAC was filed out of time.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Execution of PARAD Decision:** Martinez can now execute the PARAD decision.
*   **Precedent Setting:** The resolution clarifies the rule regarding the timeliness of filing a petition for the fixing of just compensation with the SAC, overruling the prior ruling in *LBP v. Suntay.*
*   **Forum Shopping Sanctions:** While the potential sanctions for forum shopping were addressed, the ruling stands as a warning to LBP.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988):** Governing law for compulsory acquisition of land and just compensation.
*   **Section 16 (d) of the CARL:** provides for the preliminary determination of just compensation by the DARAB.
*   **Rule XIII, Section 11 of the DARAB Rules of Procedure:** Sets the 15-day period for appeal.
*   **Section 57 of RA No. 6657:** discusses the jurisdiction of the SAC.

**Case Law References:**

*   *Philippine Veterans Bank v. Court of Appeals*, 379 Phil. 141 (2000): Established the 15-day rule for filing with the SAC.
*   *DARAB v. Lubrica*, G.R. No. 159145, April 29, 2005: Reaffirmed the *Philippine Veterans Bank* ruling.
*   *LBP v. Suntay*, G.R. No. 157903 (October 11, 2007): Initially contradicted the *Philippine Veterans Bank* rule, but was effectively overruled by the present Resolution.
*   *Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals*, 331 Phil. 1070 (1996): Discussed the jurisdiction of the SAC (but was distinguished for not discussing the timeliness of the filing).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The apparent conflict and eventual resolution in favor of the *Philippine Veterans Bank/Lubrica* rule clarifies the 15-day period, but past reliance on the *Suntay* decision could raise equitable arguments in other pending cases.
