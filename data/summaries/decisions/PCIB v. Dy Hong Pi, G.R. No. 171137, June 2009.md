## Legal Document Summary - PCI Bank vs. Spouses Dy and Chuyaco (G.R. No. 171137)

**Subject:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision declaring the trial court's order null and void and dismissing the complaint against Spouses Dy and Chuyaco due to lack of jurisdiction over their persons.

**Key Facts:**

*   PCI Bank (petitioner) sued Spouses Amadeo for unpaid debt under promissory notes.
*   Petitioner discovered Spouses Amadeo sold real properties to Spouses Dy and Chuyaco (respondents) shortly before the due date of the notes, alleging fraudulent conveyance.
*   Petitioner filed an action for rescission and damages against both sets of spouses in Civil Case No. 94-1585.
*   Spouses Amadeo initially filed a motion to dismiss based on a defective verification.
*   Petitioner attempted service on respondents via publication which was initially denied but later revisited.
*   Spouses Dy and Chuyaco filed several motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to prosecute.
*   Spouses Dy and Chuyaco filed a motion for inhibition without submitting themselves to the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court which was later adopted by their counsel.
*   Trial court denied the motion for inhibition, asserting respondents voluntarily submitted to its jurisdiction.
*   Court of Appeals granted Spouses Dy and Chuyaco's Petition for Certiorari, declaring the trial court's order null and void, and dismissing the complaint against them.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction over Person:** Whether Spouses Dy and Chuyaco voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the trial court.
*   **Voluntary Appearance (Rule 14, Sec. 20, Rules of Court):** The core issue revolves around the interpretation of what constitutes a voluntary appearance, and whether the respondents' motions, specifically the "Motion for Inhibition," waived their objection to personal jurisdiction.
*   **Propriety of Certiorari (Rule 65, Rules of Court):** Whether the respondents prematurely filed a Petition for Certiorari without first filing a Motion for Reconsideration.
*   **Inhibition of Judge (Rule 137, Rules of Court):** Whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the Motion for Inhibition, arguing delay and incompetence.
*   **Rescission (Art. 1381, Civil Code):** The underlying claim rests on the premise of *accion pauliana* i.e. that Spouses Amadeo fraudulently transferred property to Spouses Dy and Chuyaco to the detriment of their creditors.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Spouses Amadeo:** Obligation to pay the debt owed to PCI Bank. Potential liability for fraudulent conveyance.
*   **Spouses Dy and Chuyaco:** Potential liability to have the sale rescinded if deemed a fraudulent conveyance.  Potential liability for damages.
*   **PCI Bank:** Obligation to properly serve summons to obtain jurisdiction over Spouses Dy and Chuyaco. Obligation to present evidence of fraudulent conveyance.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "Voluntary Appearance":** The court grapples with the nuances of special vs. general appearance, particularly concerning filing motions *with* express reservations regarding jurisdiction.  The inclusion of "without submitting themselves to the jurisdiction..." clauses may not be sufficient to avoid submission to jurisdiction if affirmative relief is sought.
*   **Proof of Fraudulent Conveyance:** The petitioner must adequately prove the elements of *accion pauliana*, including insolvency, intent to defraud, and creditor prejudice.
*   **Laches:** The extended delay in prosecuting the case against the Respondents Dy and Chuyaco.
*   **Effect of Lis Pendens:** The notice of lis pendens attached to the property titles creates a cloud, potentially hindering their marketability, even with the case dismissed against respondents by the CA.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Busuego v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. L-48955, June 30, 1987)
*   *Pimentel v. Salanga* (G.R. No. L-27934, September 18, 1967)
*   *Webb, et al. v. People of the Philippines, et al.* (G.R. No. 127262, July 24, 1997)
*   Numerous cited cases regarding the requirements of Rule 65.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTS** the petition, reversing the Court of Appeals and holding that Spouses Dy and Chuyaco **did** voluntarily submit to the trial court's jurisdiction. The SC ordered them to answer the Complaint.

**Analysis:**

The Supreme Court found that by filing the Motion to Dismiss for Failure to Prosecute *without* a clear and unequivocal assertion of lack of jurisdiction, and by subsequently seeking affirmative relief through the Motion for Inhibition, the respondents had implicitly waived their jurisdictional objections. This ruling emphasizes the importance of explicitly raising jurisdictional objections and avoiding the pursuit of relief inconsistent with a challenge to jurisdiction. This aligns with previous jurisprudence that a party’s active participation in the proceedings constitutes invocation of the court’s jurisdiction. The SC also noted the respondents cannot claim delay since their Omnibus Motion was properly not acted upon due to an improper notice of hearing. The court also found there was no legal basis to order the trial judge's inhibition.
