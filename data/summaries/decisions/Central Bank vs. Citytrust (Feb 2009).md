**Legal Document Summary: *Central Bank of the Philippines v. Citytrust Banking Corporation*, G.R. No. 141835, February 4, 2009**

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's finding of concurrent negligence in a suit for recovery of a sum of money with damages.

**Facts:** Citytrust (formerly Feati Bank) maintained a demand deposit with Central Bank of the Philippines (CBP). An authorized roving teller of Citytrust, Rounceval Flores, presented checks for payment to CBP. CBP's teller failed to properly verify Flores' signature on the cash transfer slip, accepting a signature as "Rosauro C. Cayabyab" instead of Flores' actual signature. CBP paid the checks and debited Citytrust's account. Citytrust later claimed the checks were stolen and cancelled, demanding restoration of the funds.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Demand Deposit Agreement:** Governed by provisions on simple loan (Art. 1980, Civil Code). CBP, as a bank, owes a fiduciary duty to Citytrust as a depositor, requiring "high standards of integrity and performance" (Sec. 2, RA 8791). CBP has an obligation to exercise a higher degree of diligence than that of a good father of a family.

*   **Citytrust's Obligations:** Citytrust had obligations to safeguard its checks, timely cancel them, and report any loss or theft to CBP to prevent fraudulent encashment.

*   **CBP's Obligations:** Verify signatures on cash transfer slips against specimen signatures, even for familiar roving tellers.

**Liabilities:**

*   **CBP:** Liable for negligence in failing to verify the roving teller's signature, allowing encashment of checks with a discrepancy, despite its fiduciary duty to Citytrust.

*   **Citytrust:** Liable for contributory negligence in failing to timely examine its account, cancel the checks after they were supposedly stolen, and notify CBP of the loss/theft, which would have mitigated the damages.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1980, Civil Code:** Deposits in banks are governed by provisions concerning simple loan.
*   **Republic Act No. 8791 (RA 8791), Section 2:** Defines the fiduciary nature of banking and requires "high standards of integrity and performance."
*   **Article 1172, Civil Code:** Defines the standard of diligence required of an obligor.
*   **Article 2179, Civil Code:** Addresses contributory negligence and mitigation of damages.
*   **Simex International v. Court of Appeals:** Establishes bank's obligation to treat depositor accounts with meticulous care.
*   **Consolidated Bank and Trust Corporation v. Court of Appeals:** Reinforces the fiduciary duty of banks to their depositors and high standard of care.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **CBP's argument:** CBP argued that Flores' status as a known roving teller for five years excused verification. The court rejected this. CBP argued that it cannot be sued, however, CBP's Charter states that it may sue and be sued. CBP argued that Citytrust's civil reservation on the criminal case against Flores barred the subsequent civil case, the court rejected that because it was a separate cause of action.
*   **Causation:** CBP argued that Citytrust's negligence was the proximate cause of the loss. The court found Citytrust's negligence to be contributory, not proximate.
*   **Mitigation of Damages:** Citytrust's delay in reporting the theft was considered in mitigating damages.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **60/40 Allocation of Loss:** The court allocated the loss 60% to CBP and 40% to Citytrust. This poses a financial risk to CBP, higher than the financial risk to Citytrust.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision with modification, allocating the loss based on comparative negligence. While CBP's failure to verify the signature was deemed the immediate cause, Citytrust's delayed reporting of the theft contributed to the overall loss, justifying the allocation. The key takeaway is the reinforcement of the high fiduciary duty of banks to their depositors and the importance of due diligence, while also recognizing the depositor's responsibility in mitigating losses.
