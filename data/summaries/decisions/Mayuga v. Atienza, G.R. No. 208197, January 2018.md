## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 208197

**Case Name:** ARACELI MAYUGA, SUBSTITUTED BY MARILYN MAYUGA SANTILLAN FOR AND ON BEHALF OF ALL THE HEIRS, PETITIONER, V. ANTONIO ATIENZA, REPRESENTING THE HEIRS OF ARMANDO ATIENZA; BENJAMIN ATIENZA, JR., REPRESENTING THE HEIRS OF BENJAMIN A. ATIENZA, SR., RESPONDENTS.

**Citation:** 823 Phil. 389; 114 OG No. 42, 7158 (October 15, 2018)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Core Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) erred in reversing the Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision and dismissing the petitioner's amended complaint for cancellation of free patent and reconveyance.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Background:**  Araceli Mayuga filed a complaint seeking cancellation of Free Patent Applications (FPAs) No. 11636 and 11637, and reconveyance, against Antonio Atienza and Benjamin Atienza Jr., representing the heirs of Armando and Benjamin Atienza Sr., respectively, arguing that they fraudulently obtained the free patents over land that should be divided among the heirs of Perfecto Atienza (Araceli, Armando and Benjamin Sr.). Araceli alleged manipulation, misrepresentation, and lack of notice of the free patent application.
*   **Defendants' Claims:** The respondents claimed ownership based on indefeasibility of their titles after one year of issuance (citing Section 32 of PD 1529 - Property Registration Decree), open and continuous possession for over 30 years, and a "Confirmation Affidavit of Distribution of Real Estate" executed by Perfecto Atienza in 1973, confirming partition in 1960.
*   **RTC Decision:**  The RTC ruled in favor of Araceli, directing cancellation of the certificates of title and reconveyance of 1/3 share to her, finding fraud in the application process due to lack of notice to Araceli.
*   **CA Decision:**  The CA reversed the RTC, dismissing the complaint. The CA based its decision on indefeasibility of title, lack of clear and convincing evidence of fraud, and failure of the petitioner to establish her title and ownership of the claimed portion. The CA placed emphasis on the fact that a Notice of Application for Free Patent was posted as required by law.

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondents:**  No outstanding obligations due to the dismissal of the case. The Certificates of Title pursuant to the Free Patents remain valid.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner:** No legal grounds to force the respondents to share the land subject of the Free Patents.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Defects:**  The respondents raised procedural issues regarding the lack of verification and certification of non-forum shopping in the Amended Complaint, and the lack of proper substitution of party after Araceli's death. While the Supreme Court did not directly address these due to the substantive ruling, they could have been decisive in the CA.
*   **Fraud Allegations:** While ultimately dismissed, the allegations of fraud in the free patent application process created a potential cloud on the title. Evidence of proper notice and compliance was crucial in negating these allegations.
*   **Inheritance Disputes:** The case highlights the complexities of inheritance disputes, particularly when land titles are involved. The "Confirmation Affidavit" played a crucial role in defeating the petitioner's claim based on intestacy.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 32:** Indefeasibility of title after one year from registration. *Crucial in the CA and SC rulings.*
*   **Civil Code, Article 1080:**  Allows partition of estate *inter vivos* (during lifetime).  Cited by the Supreme Court in the absence of a will, the heirs take under the law on intestacy.
*   **Civil Code, Article 854:**  Preterition (omission of a compulsory heir).  Cited by the SC to defeat the Petitioner's contention of fraud.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 8, Section 2:** Alternative causes of action or defenses. Used for the alternative causes of action for reconveyance and for the declaration of nullity of the titles over the land.
*   **Spouses Galang v. Spouses Reyes, 692 Phil. 652 (2012):**  Distinguishes between actions for declaration of nullity of free patents, reversion, and reconveyance.  *Key precedent cited by the Court.*
*   **Heirs of Kionisala v. Heirs of Dacut, 428 Phil. 249 (2002):** Discusses the distinctions of an ordinary action for declaration of nullity, an action for reversion and an action for reconveyance.
*   **Lopez v. Court of Appeals, 446 Phil. 722 (2003):** Application of homestead application to Free Patents.
*   **Fajardo v. Fajardo, 54 Phil. 842 (1930):** Cited to show the law as to the division of the estate of one who died testate.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "Confirmation Affidavit of Distribution of Real Estate" executed by Perfecto Atienza.  While the CA and SC gave it the presumption of validity, its precise legal effect (e.g., whether it constituted a full conveyance or a mere agreement) was not fully explored due to petitioner's failure to challenge it effectively.
* The petitioner's claim of lack of notice.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, upholding the validity of the respondents' free patents and dismissing the complaint for reconveyance. The ruling rested primarily on the indefeasibility of title under PD 1529, the failure of the petitioner to prove fraud, and the validity of the "Confirmation Affidavit" as a potential partition *inter vivos*. The case serves as a cautionary tale regarding the challenges of disputing land titles based on free patents, especially after the statutory period for challenging their validity has lapsed.
