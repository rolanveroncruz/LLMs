**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-05-1892**

**Nature:** Administrative Matter regarding the failure of a judge (Ernesto A. Reyes) to decide cases within the reglementary period and the misconduct of the Acting Clerk of Court (Ricardo R. Adolfo).

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Judge Reyes:** Found guilty of undue delay in rendering judgment on 23 cases submitted for decision before his optional retirement (violating Constitution Art. VIII, Sec. 15(1) and Section 5, Canon 6 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct). He did not request extensions despite heavy caseload. Cites *Petallar v. Pullos* (A.M. No. MTJ-03-1484) regarding the importance of efficient dispute resolution. Sanctioned under Rule 140, Rules of Court, Sec. 9 and 11(B).
*   **Clerk of Court Adolfo:** Found guilty of misconduct for (1) not accurately reflecting overdue cases in Monthly Reports (for the last quarter of 2003) as instructed by the judge, and (2) issuing a false certification stating that no cases were unresolved.  He failed to uphold the standards of ethics required for Clerks of Court. Cites *Re: Memorandum dated 27 Sept. 1999 of Ma. Corazon M. Molo, OIC*.
*   **Penalties:**
    *   Judge Reyes: Fined P20,000 to be deducted from retirement benefits.
    *   Clerk of Court Adolfo: Fined P10,000, with a stern warning.

**Obligations:**

*   Judges have a constitutional and ethical obligation to decide cases within prescribed timeframes. Failure to do so constitutes a less serious charge under the Rules of Court.
*   Clerks of Court have an obligation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of court records and proceedings. False certifications and inaccurate reporting constitute misconduct.

**Liabilities:**

*   Undue delay in rendering judgment.
*   Dishonesty and misconduct by Clerk of Court.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Reliance on Judge Reyes' admission of the delay, while perhaps expedient, could have been strengthened with other evidence.
*   The Clerk of Court's defense of being "torn between two loyalties" might have been explored further regarding possible coercion or duress, although the Court clearly rejected it.
*   The initial inconsistencies in the report filings and eventual correction could have led to a deeper investigation on systemic failures.
*   The penalties assessed seem relatively light, given the potential implications of the misconduct on the integrity of the court system.
*   Subsequent resolution of the cases by other judges, as argued by the Clerk of Court, did not absolve the original respondents of their administrative liabilities.
