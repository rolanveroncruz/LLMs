Here's a legal summary of the provided *Japan Airlines v. Court of Appeals* case, formatted in Markdown:

**Case Summary: Japan Airlines v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 118664, August 7, 1998**

**Facts:** Passengers (Agana, Francisco, Miranda) on JAL flights from the US to Manila were stranded in Narita, Japan, due to the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, a *force majeure* event that closed NAIA. Initially, JAL provided hotel accommodations.  After a few days of cancellations, JAL stopped covering hotel costs, and the passengers were later reclassified as "new passengers" and made to make arrangements themselves for the next flight to Manila.. The passengers sued JAL for damages.

**Issue:** Does JAL, as a common carrier, have the obligation to shoulder the hotel and meal expenses of its stranded passengers until they have reached their final destination, even if the delay were caused by "force majeure?"

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) modified the Court of Appeals (CA) decision. While JAL was *not* liable for actual, moral, and exemplary damages arising directly from the *force majeure* event (NAIA closure), JAL *did* breach its contractual obligation to the passengers when it failed to make necessary arrangements for their onward travel to Manila after the airport reopened and reclassified the passengers.  The SC awarded nominal damages for this breach.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Contract of Carriage:** The SC acknowledges that a contract of carriage is imbued with public interest, requiring a high standard of care from the carrier.
*   ***Force Majeure* Exception:**  General rule is non-liability for damages due to *force majeure*. However, the *force majeure* event (NAIA closure) only excused JAL from *immediate* performance, but *not* from its overall contractual duty.
*   **Carrier's Continuing Duty:** Even with *force majeure*, the carrier has an ongoing duty to its passengers, including making reasonable arrangements for the continuation of their journey once the impediment ceases, per *PAL v. Court of Appeals* (226 SCRA 423 (1993)), although this case was distinguished because PAL employees acted with apathy in the cited case..
*   **Breach of Contract:** JAL breached its contract of carriage by failing to secure passage for the passengers to Manila on the next available flight and reclassifying the passengers as "new passengers."
*   **Nominal Damages (Art. 2221, 2222 Civil Code):** Awarded to vindicate a violated right where no actual loss is proven but recognizes the breach of contract.  The court cited both Article 2221 and 2222 of the civil code.
*   **Risk Incident to Travel:** Passengers must bear risks inherent in air travel, such as adverse weather (8 Am Jur 2d citing Thomas v. American Airlines, US Av 102). Common carriers are not insurers of all risks (*Pilapil v. Court of Appeals*, 180 SCRA 546 (1988)).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Scope of "Necessary Arrangements":** The ruling is somewhat ambiguous regarding the precise extent of the "necessary arrangements" JAL was obligated to make.  What level of effort and expense is required?
*   **Burden of Proof:** It's unclear from the decision who bears the burden of proving what arrangements were actually made (or not made) by JAL after the NAIA closure.
*   **Limited Precedent:** The ruling is quite specific to the facts; the applicability to other *force majeure* events and carrier responsibilities is somewhat limited.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code of the Philippines:** Articles 1157, 2221, and 2222 are explicitly cited, relating to sources of obligations and nominal damages.

**Case Law:**

*   **PAL v. Court of Appeals, 226 SCRA 423 (1993):** Distinguished based on the presence of negligence/bad faith on PAL's part, but the principle of a continuing duty to passengers was acknowledged.
* **Pilapil v. Court of Appeals, 180 SCRA 546 (1988):** Passengers take the risks incident to the mode of travel.
* **Thomas v. American Airlines, US Av 102:** Passengers take the risks incident to the mode of travel.

**Conclusion:**

JAL, while not liable for damages directly caused by the *force majeure* event, was liable for breaching its contractual obligation to provide onward transport once the impediment ceased. The Court clarifies the limits of the *force majeure* defense in the context of common carrier obligations, emphasizing a continuing duty to make reasonable arrangements for passengers. The award of nominal damages serves as a vindication of the passenger's right to proper service within the bounds of the contract of carriage.
