**Case:** People v. Garte, G.R. No. 176152, November 25, 2008

**Nature:** Appeal of conviction for four counts of rape under Art. 266-A in relation to Art. 266-B, RPC, as amended by RA 8353 (Incestuous Rape).  The original RTC decision imposed the death penalty which was modified by the Court of Appeals to reclusion perpetua due to RA 9346 (abolishing the death penalty).

**Facts:**  Appellant, Nido Garte, was convicted of raping his 17-year-old daughter (AAA) on four separate occasions. The incidents involved force, intimidation, and a weapon (knife or gun). The victim reported the incidents, and a medical examination revealed she was no longer a virgin. The appellant denied the charges and presented an alibi.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Art. 266-A in relation to Art. 266-B, RPC (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines and penalizes rape, specifically incestuous rape committed with force, violence, or intimidation. The father's moral ascendancy substitutes for actual violence or intimidation in incest cases.
*   **RA 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, resulting in the modification of the sentence to *reclusion perpetua* for each count.
*   **Obligation to pay Civil Indemnity, Moral Damages, and Exemplary Damages:** The appellant is obligated to pay the victim compensation for the harm caused by the crimes. Awards are P75,000 civil indemnity, P75,000 moral damages (increased from P50,000 by the Supreme Court), and P25,000 exemplary damages per count, totaling significant financial liability.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Convicted of four counts of rape, resulting in a sentence of *reclusion perpetua* per count. The appellant is not eligible for parole under Section 3 of RA 9346.
*   **Civil Liability:**  Liable for substantial monetary damages to the victim to compensate for the emotional and physical harm.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Inconsistencies in Victim's Statements:** The defense argued inconsistencies in the victim's *Salaysays* regarding the number of rape incidents and the weapon used. The court dismissed these inconsistencies as minor and immaterial, but this could have been exploited more effectively if proper impeachment procedures (Rule 132, Section 13 of the Rules of Court) had been followed.
*   **Credibility of Alibi:** The alibi was weak because the appellant admitted being in the vicinity during parts of the day when the crimes occurred.
*   **Moral Ascendancy as Substitute for Force:** The legal principle that a father's moral ascendancy over his daughter substitutes for force and intimidation is a sensitive area.  While legally established, it requires careful consideration of the specific facts and circumstances.
*   **No Parole:** RA 9346 eliminates the possibility of parole for persons sentenced to reclusion perpetua.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Campos v. People*** (G.R. No. 175275, February 19, 2008): Reiterates the weight given to a rape victim's testimony against a parent due to ingrained Filipino values of respect and the improbability of false accusations, highlighting the credibility of the testimony.
*   ***People v. Rodavia*** (426 Phil. 707, 719 (2002)): Affirms that the use of a weapon is not a necessary element of rape and that a father's moral ascendancy substitutes for force or intimidation.
*   ***People v. Gloria*** (G.R. No. 168476, September 27, 2006, 503 SCRA 742, 753) highlights that lapses in recounting traumatic experience is expected and not indicative of untruthfulness.
* ***People v. Palac, G.R. No. 175600, April 23, 2008, 552 SCRA 616, 625:*** Reaffirms the view that minor inconsistencies in testimony are excusable in traumatic cases.
* ***People v. Relucio, No. L-38790, November 9, 1978, 86 SCRA 227, 288:*** Sets out the requirement to give the witness a chance to reconcile conflicting declarations, which means laying the predicate.
*   ***People v. Nazareno*** (G.R. No. 167756, April 9, 2008, 551 SCRA 16) and ***People v. Dela Paz*** (G.R. No. 177294, February 19, 2008, 546 SCRA 363): Addresses the issue of ineligibility for parole.
*   ***People v. Ramos*** (G.R. No. 179030, June 12, 2008, 554 SCRA 423): Provides prevailing jurisprudence with respect to moral damages.

**Summary for legal purposes:**  *People v. Garte* involves the affirmance of a rape conviction, underscoring the credibility given to the victim's testimony in incest cases. Key legal principles include the father's moral ascendancy substituting for force, and the absence of parole under RA 9346. This case also emphasizes the importance of following procedural rules regarding impeachment of witnesses and highlights the significant financial liability stemming from both civil indemnity and damages in rape convictions. While there were slight inconsistencies in the testimonies, these were deemed inconsequential.
