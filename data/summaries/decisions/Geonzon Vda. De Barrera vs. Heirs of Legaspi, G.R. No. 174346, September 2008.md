**Case Summary: *Fernanda Geonzon Vda. de Barrera and Johnny Oco, Jr. v. Heirs of Vicente Legaspi***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 174346, September 12, 2008

**Facts:** This case involves a dispute over possession of a 0.9504-hectare farmland. Respondents (Heirs of Legaspi) filed a complaint for Reconveyance of Possession with Preliminary Mandatory Injunction and Damages against Petitioners (Barrera and Oco, Jr.). Respondents claimed prior possession and dispossession by Oco and others. Petitioners asserted ownership based on a chain of title originating from OCT No. P-447.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Subject Matter Jurisdiction:** The central issue is whether the RTC had jurisdiction over the case, considering the property's assessed value. The court held the RTC lacked jurisdiction.
*   **Assessed Value vs. Estimated Value:** The Supreme Court distinguished between "assessed value" (determined by taxing authorities, PHP 11,160 per Tax Declaration No. 7565) and "estimated value" (fair market value, allegedly PHP 50,000), holding that assessed value is the jurisdictional element under Section 33 of BP 129 as amended by RA 7691.
*   **Accion Publiciana vs. Forcible Entry:** The Court *en passant* notes that the respondents' cause of action (accion publiciana) was a wrong mode. The dispossession took place on October 1, 1996 and the complaint was filed four months thereafter or on February 7, 1997. Respondents' exclusion from the property had thus not lasted for more than one year.
*   **Ownership and Right to Possession:** While the lower courts delved into possession *de jure* (accion publiciana), the Supreme Court sidestepped the issue due to jurisdictional defect.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 129, Section 33 (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, as amended by Republic Act No. 7691):**  Governs the jurisdiction of Metropolitan, Municipal, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts in civil actions involving title to or possession of real property.
*   **Republic Act No. 7691:** Amended BP 129 to increase the jurisdictional amount for first-level courts.
*   **Republic Act No. 7160, Section 199 (Local Government Code):** Defines "fair market value".

**Case Law:**

*   **Aguilon v. Bohol, G.R. No. L-27169, October 20, 1977:** Cited regarding the nature of accion publiciana.
*   **Francel Realty Corporation v. Sycip, G.R. No. 154684, September 8, 2005:**  Affirmed the court's authority to dismiss a case for lack of jurisdiction at any time.

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents (Heirs of Legaspi):** The complaint was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Their claim to possession is unresolved and they must re-file the action with the proper court (Municipal Trial Court) . The dismissal is without prejudice. Given the factual finding regarding dispossession less than one year prior to filing, the correct cause of action is probably ejectment (forcible entry) to be filed within one year of dispossession.
*   **Petitioners (Barrera and Oco, Jr.):** Though successful in this appeal, their claimed ownership is not definitively established. They risk future litigation from the Respondents in the proper forum.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The allegation of respondents that the land's current estimated value is P50,000 written in a printed pleading is odd.
*   The *en passant* pronouncement regarding improper remedy (accion publiciana when the facts suggest forcible entry) is obiter dictum and might not be fully binding in future proceedings.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and RTC decisions, finding that the RTC lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the assessed value of the property (PHP 11,160) fell below the jurisdictional threshold for RTC jurisdiction.  The complaint was ordered dismissed. While the Petitioners prevailed, the issue of ownership and ultimately right to possession, remains unresolved and subject to future litigation in the proper court.
