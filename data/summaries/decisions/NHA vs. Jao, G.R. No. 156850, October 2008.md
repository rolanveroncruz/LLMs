## Legal Document Summary: NHA vs. Jao

**Case:** *National Housing Authority vs. Perico V. Jao* (G.R. No. 156850, October 24, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a lower court's order for reconveyance and damages in an expropriation case.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Expropriation:** NHA expropriated Spouses Jao Tayag's property in 1982, depositing P66,400. Writ of possession issued and NHA took possession.
*   **Abandonment:** For over 15 years, NHA failed to develop the property, leading to squatters and deterioration.
*   **Non-Payment:** No just compensation was paid to the Spouses Jao Tayag. Mere deposit with the bank was not considered payment.
*   **Trial Court Decision:** Ruled in favor of Jao, ordering NHA to reconvey the property, pay monthly compensation for loss of use (P10,000/month), damages for destroyed improvements (P500,000 with interest), and attorney's fees (P20,000). Found that NHA failed to comply with Constitutional and Civil Code provisions on eminent domain because there was taking but no just compensation.
*   **Procedural History:** NHA's appeal to the Court of Appeals was initially dismissed for failure to pay docket fees and the decision became final and executory. NHA then filed a motion to quash the writ of execution, arguing damages should be limited to the initial deposit.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Affirmed the trial court, holding that the NHA's petition effectively amounted to a belated appeal and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because the original decision was final and executory.

**Obligations:**

*   **NHA:** Obligated to reconvey the property to Jao.
*   **NHA:** Obligated to pay monetary damages to Jao, including monthly compensation, damages for destroyed improvements (with interest), and attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   **NHA:** Liable for significant monetary damages far exceeding the initial deposit due to failure to pay just compensation and abandonment of the property.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Final and Executory Judgment:** The primary risk is the enforcement of the final and executory judgment against the NHA. Res judicata prevents further challenges to the merits of the case.
*   **Accruing Interest:** The ongoing accrual of interest on the P500,000 damages for destroyed improvements.
*   **Continuing Damages:** The monthly compensation of P10,000 continues to accrue until the property is reconveyed.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution & Art 435 of the Civil Code:** Cited by the trial court regarding requirements for eminent domain (taking and just compensation).
*   **Rule 67, Section 11 of the Rules of Court:** The trial court used this to support its decision, stating that If the appellate court determines that the plaintiff has no right of expropriation, judgment shall be rendered ordering the Regional Trial Court to forthwith enforce the restoration to the defendant of the possession of the property and to determine the damages which the defendant sustained and may recover by reason of the possession taken by the plaintiff."
*   *NHA v. Heirs of Guivelondo, 452 Phil. 481, 493 (2003)*: Cited by the Supreme Court stating "A final and executory order can no longer be disturbed no matter how erroneous it may be. Any judicial error should be corrected through an appeal and not through repeated suits on the same claim"

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main contention revolves around the scope of damages recoverable beyond the initial deposit. The NHA argued damages should be limited to the P66,400 deposit. The courts rejected this argument.
*   The fact the original appeal was dismissed for procedural reasons (failure to pay docket fees) rather than on the merits created the situation where a potentially questionable damages award became final.

**Overall Assessment:**

The NHA is in a difficult position. The judgment is final and executory, and the Supreme Court affirmed that it cannot be disturbed. The focus now should be on mitigating the accruing damages by promptly reconveying the property and negotiating a settlement regarding the outstanding monetary obligations, if possible.
