**Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Banking Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*, G.R. No. 170574 (2009)**

**Case Overview:**

The Supreme Court reviewed a Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) decision holding Philippine Banking Corporation (now Global Business Bank, Inc.) liable for deficiency Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) on its "Special/Super Savings Deposit Account" (SSDA) for the taxable years 1996 and 1997. The primary issue was whether the SSDA constitutes a "certificate of deposit drawing interest" under Section 180 of the 1977 National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), as amended, before the enactment of RA 9243.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 180 of the 1977 NIRC (as amended):**  Imposes DST on loan agreements, promissory notes, bills of exchange, drafts, instruments and securities issued by the government or any of its instrumentalities, **certificates of deposit bearing interest**, and others not payable on sight or demand.
*   **SSDA Features:** The SSDA is a savings account evidenced by a passbook but offering higher interest rates for maintaining substantial balances and specific holding periods.  Withdrawals are permitted without strict pre-termination penalties, but the interest rate reverts to a standard savings rate if the holding period or minimum balance isn't met.
*   **RA 9243 (amendatory provision):** This specifically includes "certificates or other evidences of deposits that are either drawing interest significantly higher than the regular savings deposit taking into consideration the size of the deposit and the risks involved or drawing interest and having a specific maturity date."
*   **RA 9480 (Tax Amnesty Act of 2007):**  Granted a tax amnesty covering national internal revenue taxes for taxable year 2005 and prior years, provided the taxpayer fulfilled all the conditions of the Tax Amnesty Program.

**Liabilities & Holdings:**

*   **CTA Holding:** The CTA found the SSDA functionally equivalent to a time deposit and therefore a "certificate of deposit drawing interest," subject to DST under Section 180. The passbook does not determine the form and labels.
*   **Supreme Court Initial Ruling:** The Court initially affirmed the CTA decision, stating that Section 180 of the 1977 NIRC, refers to a time deposit account. It rejected the argument that only negotiable certificates of deposit are taxable. In *International Exchange Bank v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue* the Supreme Court ruled that a passbook representing an interest earning deposit account issued by a bank qualifies as a certificate of deposit drawing interest and should be subject to DST. The amendment to include “other evidences of deposits that are drawing interest significantly higher than the regular savings deposit” was intended to eliminate the ambiguity. The Court explained: "that a deposit that has a maturity...which is time, in effect, regardless of what form it takes should be subject to DST"
*   **Supreme Court Final Ruling:** Granted the petition and set aside the Court of Tax Appeals’ Decision due to the merger and availment of a tax amnesty. *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company* (the surviving entity) filed a tax amnesty. This included all deficiency tax assessments of the BIR subject of this petition.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Certificate of Deposit":**  The core issue hinged on the definition of "certificate of deposit" under the 1977 NIRC, specifically whether it encompassed a savings account with features similar to a time deposit but evidenced by a passbook. *Far East Bank and Trust Company v. Querimit* (424 Phil. 721) defined a certificate of deposit. The definition of a certificate of deposit is all encompassing to include a savings account deposit such as ISA (*Banco de Oro Universal Bank v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*).
*   **Retroactive Application of RA 9243:** Petitioner argued that RA 9243, specifically including SSDA-like accounts, could not be applied retroactively to tax years 1996 and 1997.
*   **Exception to Tax Amnesty:** The BIR's Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 19-2008 attempted to exclude cases already ruled in favor of the BIR. The Supreme Court found this "misplaced." RA 9480 is specifically clear that the exceptions to the tax amnesty program include "tax cases subject of final and executory judgment by the courts.” The present case has not become final and executory when Metrobank availed of the tax amnesty program.
*   **Reliance on Substance over Form:** The Court emphasized that substance over form is paramount in determining the taxability of instruments. The CTA did so by ruling that the passbook and labels does not matter, it is about the actual transaction of the certificate of deposit.
