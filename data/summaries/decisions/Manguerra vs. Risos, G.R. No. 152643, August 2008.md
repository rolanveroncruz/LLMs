## Legal Document Summary: *Concepcion Cuenco Vda. de Manguerra v. Raul Risos et al.* G.R. No. 152643

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision that invalidated Regional Trial Court (RTC) orders allowing the deposition of the complainant, Concepcion Cuenco Vda. de Manguerra, in a criminal case for Estafa Through Falsification of Public Document (Criminal Case No. CBU-52248).

**Key Issue:** Whether Rule 23 of the Rules of Court (Civil Procedure â€“ Depositions) applies to the deposition of the prosecution witness in a criminal case, or whether Section 15, Rule 119 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure governs.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition, affirming the CA decision. The SC held that Section 15, Rule 119 specifically governs the examination of prosecution witnesses who are too sick or infirm to appear at trial. Rule 23 of the Rules of Court does *not* apply suppletorily because the criminal procedure rules adequately address the situation.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 15, Rule 119, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Dictates that conditional examination of a prosecution witness who is too sick/infirm to attend trial *must* be conducted "before the court where the case is pending," in the presence of the accused (or after reasonable notice). The examination must be conducted like a trial examination (question and answer).
* **Right to Confrontation**: Accused's Constitutional Right to confrontation must be ensured through taking the witness' testimony before the same court hearing the case.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Procedural Error:** Failure to implead the People of the Philippines in the CA petition was a defect, as criminal actions are prosecuted under the control of the public prosecutor (Sec. 5, Rule 110). However, the CA correctly disregarded this procedural flaw in the interest of substantial justice, as the OSG was able to comment on the petition.
*   **Invalid Deposition:** The RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in allowing the deposition to be taken before the Clerk of Court in Makati, instead of before the RTC in Cebu City where the criminal case was pending. Any deposition taken under that order is void.
*   **Risk of Exclusion of Evidence:** Failure to adhere to Section 15, Rule 119 may result in the exclusion of the deposition testimony as evidence against the accused, potentially weakening the prosecution's case.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 15, Rule 119, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Crucial provision governing the deposition of prosecution witnesses.
*   **Rule 23, Rules of Court (Civil Procedure):** Found to be inapplicable as the situation is governed under criminal procedure.
*   **Sec. 5, Rule 110, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure**: Dictates that public prosecutor controls criminal actions, and the State is an indispensable party.
* **Section 14(2), Article III of the Constitution**: Discusses the rights of the accused to meet the witnesses face to face.
*   **Commissioner Domingo v. Scheer, 466 Phil. 235 (2004):** Cited for the principle that procedural rules should not hinder justice.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** None apparent. The SC's interpretation of Section 15, Rule 119 is clear and unambiguous.

**Potential Risks & Considerations for the Prosecution:**

*   **Witness Unavailability:** If the witness remains unable to travel, the prosecution must comply strictly with Section 15, Rule 119 to ensure admissibility of the deposition.
*   **Constitutional Rights:** The Court emphasizes protecting the accused's constitutional rights. Any deviation from the prescribed procedure risks having evidence excluded.
