## Legal Document Summary: People v. Bragais and Tacuyo, G.R. No. 270580

**Case:** Appeal of conviction for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Parties:**

*   **Plaintiff-Appellee:** People of the Philippines
*   **Accused-Appellants:** Jose Roel Bragais y Sison & Alfredo Tacuyo y Evangelista

**Facts:**

Bragais and Tacuyo were convicted of the murder of a 12-year-old girl, Paula Apilado y Viray, based primarily on the eyewitness testimony of Mambo Dela Cruz Delima, a person with intellectual disability. The RTC and CA both found Mambo competent and credible.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Competency of Witness with Intellectual Disability:** The Supreme Court upheld the CA's ruling that intellectual disability *per se* does not disqualify a person from testifying. Cites *People v. Monticalvo*, *People v. Trelles*, A.M. No. 19-08-15-SC amending Rule 130, sec. 21(1). A witness is competent if they can perceive and make known their perception.
*   **Waiver of Objection:** The SC agreed with the CA that the defense waived their objection to Mambo's competency by failing to timely object during the trial, particularly after the submission of a psychiatric report. The defense focused on the prosecution's request to propound leading questions to Mambo, and not to Mambo's competence as a witness.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The SC deferred to the RTC's assessment of Mambo's credibility, noting his "unwavering" testimony despite inconsistencies.
*   **Conspiracy:** The SC found implied conspiracy based on the accused's coordinated actions during the murder (holding the victim, stabbing, disposing of the body), citing Article 8(2) of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Treachery:** The SC affirmed the finding of treachery, qualifying the killing as murder, because the victim was a minor. Cites *People v. Enojo*. The age and vulnerability of the victim constituted treachery, regardless of whether the information alleged the specific means.
*   **Evident Premeditation:** The Court agreed with the CA's ruling that the element of premeditation was not proven.
*   **Alibi:** Bragais's alibi was deemed insufficient, especially since he admitted proximity to the crime scene.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua was properly imposed, there being no ordinary aggravating or mitigating circumstances (treachery being a qualifying circumstance, not an aggravating one). Cites Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Damages:** The SC sustained the CAâ€™s award of damages, citing *People v. Jugueta*: PHP 75,000 each for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages, and PHP 50,000 for temperate damages. 6% interest per annum was added to the monetary awards from the finality of the decision until fully paid.
*   **Language:** Emphasized using "people-first language" regarding individuals with disabilities, citing the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and shifting away from outdated terms like "mental retardate."

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 248, Revised Penal Code (Murder)
*   Article 8(2), Revised Penal Code (Conspiracy)
*   Article 63(2), Revised Penal Code (Penalty imposition)
*   Rule 130, Section 21(1), Rules of Evidence (Competency of Witnesses)

**Case Law References:**

*   *People v. Monticalvo* (Competency of Witnesses with Intellectual Disability)
*   *People v. Trelles* (Competency of Witnesses with Intellectual Disability)
*   *People v. Enojo* (Treachery in killing a minor)
*   *People v. Jugueta* (Damages for murder)

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Reliance on Eyewitness Testimony:** The case hinges heavily on the testimony of a witness with intellectual disability, potentially raising concerns about reliability and suggestibility.
*   **Lack of Physical Evidence:** The absence of specific hymenal injuries questioned the theory of rape, although the court dismissed it since rape was not an element in the charge of murder.
*   **Treachery based on minority:** While jurisprudence supports the application of treachery based on the victim's age, it could be argued that the specifics of the attack should have been alleged to fully establish the element.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, emphasizing the competence and credibility of the eyewitness, the existence of conspiracy, the presence of treachery due to the victim's minority, and the proper application of the penalty and damages. The decision serves as a reminder that individuals with intellectual disabilities are not *per se* disqualified from testifying and that conspiracy can be implied from concerted actions.
