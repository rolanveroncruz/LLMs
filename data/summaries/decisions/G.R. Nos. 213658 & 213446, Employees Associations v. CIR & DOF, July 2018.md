## Legal Document Summary (G.R. Nos. 213446 and 213658)

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Certiorari, Prohibition, and/or Mandamus under Rule 65 challenging the validity of Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 23-2014 issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR).

**Key Issue:** Validity of RMO No. 23-2014 regarding withholding taxes on compensation paid to government officials and employees. Petitioners allege grave abuse of discretion by the CIR.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *partially granted* the petitions.

**Key Provisions Challenged:**

*   **Section III & IV (Validity Upheld Prospectively):** These sections define compensation income and enumerate allowances, bonuses, and benefits subject to withholding tax. The Court found that they mirror the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, and its implementing rules, and are therefore valid. The Court recognized that whether specific benefits qualified for exemption was a factual issue to be determined in separate administrative/judicial proceedings.

    *   **Relevant Statute:** Section 32(A) NIRC 1997, as amended, Section 79(A) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, Section 2.78 of RR No. 2-98.

    *   **Case Law:** ING Bank N.V. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Chamber of Real Estate and Builders Associations, Inc. v. Romulo.

*   **Section VI (Declared Partially Invalid):** This section designates officials responsible for withholding taxes. The Court held that the CIR exceeded its authority by including Provincial Governors, Mayors, Barangay Captains, and Heads of Office as persons required to withhold and remit taxes, as these officials are not so designated under the NIRC or its implementing rules. This was considered a supplanting of legislative detail, a power reserved for the Secretary of Finance.

    *   **Relevant Statute:** Section 82 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.

    *   **Relevant Regulation:** RR No. 2-98, Sec. 2.58(C), 2.82 and 2.83.1

*   **Section VII (Validity Upheld):** This section outlines penalties for non-compliance as withholding agents. The Court found that it simply reiterates the relevant penalty provisions of the NIRC.

    *   **Relevant Statute:** NIRC 1997, as amended, Section 251, 255, and 272.

    *   **Relevant Regulation:** RR No. 2-98

**Obligations:**

*   Government offices remain obligated to withhold and remit appropriate taxes on employee compensation.
*   Employees claiming exemptions from withholding taxes must prove their entitlement through administrative and judicial channels.

**Liabilities:**

*   Officials designated by the NIRC (e.g., Chief Accountants, Treasurers) are liable for failing to properly withhold and remit taxes. This liability is delineated by Section 272 of the NIRC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Non-compliance Risks:** Government officials designated in RMO No. 23-2014 and RR No. 2-98 are at risk of penalties for failure to comply with withholding tax requirements under the NIRC. Section 251 NIRC
*   **Litigation:** The decision does not preclude individual employees from filing claims for tax exemptions through administrative channels (e.g., BIR) or with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA).
*   **Ambiguity:** The decision leaves open the question of what specific allowances and benefits constitute "fringe benefits" or "de minimis benefits," requiring further administrative guidance or judicial interpretation.
*   **Reliance Risk:** Government employees who relied in good faith on employer's withholding practices may face penalties if their benefits were improperly classified and taxes underpaid. The prospective application of this ruling aims to mitigate this.

**Procedural Considerations:**

*   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** The Court notes that the proper avenue for contesting the RMO is initially through an appeal to the Secretary of Finance before resorting to judicial remedies. *Asia International Auctioneers, Inc. v. Parayno, Jr*.
*   **Hierarchy of Courts:** The Court emphasizes that challenges to revenue issuances should generally originate in the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) which has exclusive appellate jurisdiction *Banco de Oro v. Republic* (2016).
*   **Equal Protection** The Court held that RMO No. 23-2014 did not violate the equal protection clause.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Petition for Mandamus seeking an increase in the tax-exempt ceiling was dismissed as moot due to the enactment of RA Nos. 10653 and 10963, increasing the ceiling.
*   The Court ruled that upholding Sections III and IV would be prospective only.
