## Summary of A.M. No. 08-6-352-RTC: Query of Atty. Karen M. Silverio-Buffe

**Nature:** Administrative Matter regarding the prohibition of a former Clerk of Court from engaging in the private practice of law before the court where she previously served.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **R.A. 6713, Section 7(b)(2):** Generally prohibits public officials/employees from engaging in private practice of their profession during incumbency, unless authorized by the Constitution or law, *provided* such practice does not conflict with their official functions.
*   **One-Year Prohibition:** This prohibition extends for one year after resignation/retirement/separation, *except* for the (b)(2) exception, but the professional concerned cannot practice his profession in connection with any matter before the office he used to be with, in which case the one-year prohibition shall likewise apply.
*   **Canon 3, Section 5, Code of Conduct for Court Personnel:** Limits outside employment of court personnel. Specifically prohibits employment that requires the practice of law.
*   **Rule 6.03, Canon 6, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Prohibits a lawyer from accepting engagement in connection with any matter in which they had intervened while in government service.
*   **Canon 1, Rule 1.01, Code of Professional Responsibility:** A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.
*   **Canon 7, Code of Professional Responsibility:** A lawyer shall at all times uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Buffe:** Found guilty of violating Rule 1.01 of Canon 1 and Canon 7 of the Code of Professional Responsibility by engaging in private practice before RTC Branch 81 within one year of her resignation as Clerk of Court VI.

**Liabilities and Penalties:**

*   **Fine:** P10,000.00
*   **Stern Warning:** Against future violations.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Misinterpretation of R.A. 6713, Section 7(b)(2):** Atty. Buffe incorrectly interpreted the provision as granting a blanket authority to incumbent clerks of court to practice law.
*   **Conflict of Interest:** The Court emphasizes the importance of avoiding any real or perceived conflict of interest that could arise from a former court employee practicing before their former court.
*   **Erosion of Public Confidence:** Open disregard for laws like R.A. 6713 erodes public confidence in the law and in lawyers.
*   **Forum Shopping:** While not strictly *forum shopping*, her resort to multiple legal avenues to get her desired interpretation demonstrated a disregard for proper procedure.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Cayetano v. Monsod (G.R. No. 100113, September 3, 1991, 201 SCRA 210):** Defines the practice of law.
*   **Prudential Bank v. Castro (A.C. No. 2756, November 12, 1987, 155 SCRA 604):** Illustrates the application of *res ipsa loquitur* and the Court's authority to discipline lawyers without formal investigation when facts on record sufficiently establish liability.
* **Richards v. Asoy (A. C. No. 2655 , July 9, 1987, 152 SCRA 45)** Application of *res ipsa loquitur* in disciplining a lawyer.
* **In re: Wenceslao Laureta (G.R. No. L-68635, May 14, 1987, 149 SCRA 570)** Application of *res ipsa loquitur* in punishing a lawyer.
* **Zaldivar v. Gonzales (G.R. No. L-80578 , October 7, 1988, 166 SCRA 316)** The Court has the power to discipline for contumacious conduct warranting application of the contempt power.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6713:** Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 139:** Related to disciplinary proceedings for attorneys.
*   **Constitution of the Philippines, Article VIII, Section 5(b) and Section 6:** Pertaining to the rule-making power and administrative supervision of the Supreme Court.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "such practice" in Section 7(b)(2):** Atty. Buffe's misinterpretation of the phrase "such practice" led her to believe incumbent public officials had preferential treatment over resigned officials. The Court clarifies that the "such practice" refers only to practice authorized by the Constitution or law.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court found Atty. Buffe guilty of professional misconduct for violating the prohibition against practicing law before her former court within one year of her resignation. The decision underscores the importance of upholding the integrity of public service, avoiding conflicts of interest, and strictly adhering to the legal profession's ethical standards.
