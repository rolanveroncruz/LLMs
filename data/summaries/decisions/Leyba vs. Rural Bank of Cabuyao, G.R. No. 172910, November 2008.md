**Case Summary: Spouses Loreto Leyba and Matea Leyba vs. Rural Bank of Cabuyao, Inc. and Zenaida Reyes (G.R. No. 172910, November 14, 2008)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) dismissal of a complaint for Nullification of Real Estate Mortgage and Special Power of Attorney (SPA).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Plaintiffs' Claim:** Spouses Leyba (Petitioners) sought to nullify a real estate mortgage and SPA, alleging:
    *   They are registered owners of land in Calamba.
    *   Zenaida Reyes (Respondent) induced Matea Leyba to work in Japan, subject to a PhP 150,000 placement fee.
    *   Matea was made to sign an SPA authorizing Reyes to mortgage the land for a PhP 50,000 loan for the placement fee.
    *   Reyes used the SPA to obtain a PhP 500,000 loan from Rural Bank of Cabuyao, Inc. (RBCI) (Respondent), secured by a mortgage on the land.
*   **RTC Dismissal:** The RTC dismissed the case due to the spouses' failure to attend a pre-trial conference.
*   **CA Affirmance:** The CA affirmed the RTC's dismissal based on Section 5, Rule 18 of the Rules of Civil Procedure (failure of plaintiff to appear at pre-trial can be cause for dismissal).
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA decision, remanding the case to the RTC for further proceedings.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents:** RBCI and Reyes are potentially liable for damages if the SPA and mortgage are proven to be fraudulent. The amount is capped by the mortgage (Php 500,000) and the original loan intended for the placement fee (Php 50,000).
*   **Petitioners:** They have the obligation to present evidence to support their claims of fraud and duress in the execution of the SPA.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of the SPA:** The core issue is the validity of the SPA.  Specifically, whether Matea Leyba understood the document and its implications.  Evidence of fraud, misrepresentation, or undue influence by Reyes is crucial.
*   **Bona Fide Mortgagee:**  RBCI's status as a bona fide mortgagee for value without notice is critical.  Did RBCI exercise due diligence in verifying the SPA and Matea Leyba's consent? Knowledge of Reyes' alleged fraudulent scheme would negate RBCI's status as a BF mortgagee.
*   **Technicality vs. Substantive Justice:** The SC prioritized substantive justice over strict adherence to procedural rules (failure to attend pre-trial). This indicates the Court perceived a potential injustice if the case wasn't heard on its merits.
*   **Respondents' Failure to Comment:** The Respondents' refusal to comment on the petition weakens their position before the Supreme Court.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 5, Rule 18 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Governs the consequences of failure to appear at pre-trial.
*   **Vette Industrial Sales Co., Inc. v. Cheng, G.R. Nos. 170232 & 170301, December 5, 2006:**  SC cited this case emphasizing that the court should afford the party-litigants the amplest opportunity to have their cases justly determined, free from the constraints of technicalities.
*   **RN Development, Inc. v. A.I.I. System, Inc., G.R. No. 166104, June 26, 2008:**  SC cited this case pertaining to the court's power to dismiss on the ground of non prosequitur.
*   **Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 117385, February 11, 1999:**  SC cited this case for the test of whether the plaintiff is chargeable with want of due diligence in failing to proceed with reasonable promptitude.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The circumstances surrounding Matea Leyba's signing of the SPA are ambiguous. Was she aware of the full extent of the authority granted to Reyes?  Was she coerced or misled?
*   The exact amount of the loan intended for the placement fee is not definitively established (stated as "subject to a Php 150,000 placement fee" but the loan was for Php 50,000).
*   The nature of the "agreement" between Matea Leyba and Zenaida Reyes for work in Japan needs clarification. Was this a legitimate contract or part of a fraudulent scheme?

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   Focus on proving fraud and misrepresentation in obtaining the SPA.
*   Gather evidence showing RBCI's lack of good faith or knowledge of Reyes' fraudulent activities.
*   Argue that enforcing the mortgage would unjustly enrich RBCI at the expense of the spouses.
