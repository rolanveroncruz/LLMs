## Legal Document Summary: People v. Musor y Acmad, G.R. No. 231843

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Nader Musor y Acmad

**Citation:** G.R. No. 231843, November 7, 2018 (842 Phil. 1159)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Issue:** Whether Musor's guilt for violation of Section 5 of RA 9165 (illegal sale of dangerous drugs) was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

**Holding:** No. The Supreme Court acquitted Musor due to the prosecution's failure to comply with the mandatory requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165, thus failing to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, RA 9165:** Defines and penalizes the illegal sale of dangerous drugs. Prosecution must prove: (1) identity of buyer, seller, object, and consideration; and (2) delivery of the thing sold and payment therefor.
*   **Section 21, Article II, RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):** Sets out the procedure for maintaining the integrity of seized drugs used as evidence. Requires:
    *   Immediate physical inventory and photography after seizure.
    *   Presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), an elected public official, a media representative, and a DOJ representative during inventory and photography. All must sign the inventory.
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, Section 21(a):** Allows inventory and photography at the nearest police station if doing so at the scene is impracticable. However the 3 witnesses must still be present

**Liabilities:**

*   The accused was initially convicted by the RTC and CA, but was acquitted by the Supreme Court due to lapses in procedures.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Immediately after seizure and confiscation":** The Court emphasizes this means at the place of apprehension unless impracticable.
*   **Three-Witness Rule:**  The physical presence of all three required witnesses (elected public official, media representative, and DOJ representative) at the time of seizure and confiscation is mandatory, not just at the inventory. The failure to ensure all three witnesses are present when drugs are seized renders the operation invalid.
*   **Saving Clause (IRR Section 21(a)):** Non-compliance is excusable only if (1) the prosecution acknowledges the lapse and (2) provides a justifiable reason for it.  The Supreme Court found the explanation that the area was dark and had other people drinking, insufficient.
*   **Presumption of Regularity vs. Presumption of Innocence:** The Court reiterates that the presumption of regularity cannot overcome the presumption of innocence, especially when there are affirmative proofs of irregularity (i.e., breaches of Section 21).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act):**  Central statute at issue.
*   **IRR of RA 9165:** Details the implementation of RA 9165.
*   **People v. Opiana, 750 Phil. 140 (2015):** Elements of illegal sale of drugs.
*   **People v. Tomawis, G.R. No. 228890, April 18, 2018:** Purpose of the three-witness rule is to prevent planting, contamination, or loss of drugs.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Without the insulating presence of the 3 witnesses during the seizure and marking of the drugs, the evil of switching "planting" or contamination taints the incrimination of the accused
*   **People v. Reyes, 797 Phil. 671 (2016):** Application of the saving mechanism requires acknowledgement and justification of lapses.
*   **People v. Lim, G.R. No. 231989, September 4, 2018:** Enumerates acceptable reasons for failing to obtain the presence of the three witnesses.
*   **People v. Zheng Bai Hui, 393 Phil. 68, 133 (2000):** Rejects blind reliance on police operational procedures where established procedures are ignored.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "immediately after seizure and confiscation" and the level of impracticability required to justify conducting the inventory and photographing elsewhere.
*   The scope and applicability of the saving clause in IRR Section 21(a).

**Analysis:**

The Court heavily emphasizes strict compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165.  The acquittal hinges on the prosecution's failure to justify the absence of the three required witnesses at the time and place of seizure and the lack of photographs, thus compromising the chain of custody.  The ruling reinforces the importance of the presumption of innocence over the presumption of regularity in law enforcement duties and clarifies the limited scope of the saving clause. This case serves as a cautionary tale for law enforcement regarding proper procedures in drug cases.
