## Legal Document Summary: *Antig v. Antipuesto* (G.R. No. 192396)

**Case:** *Stephen A. Antig, et al. v. Anastacio Antipuesto, et al.* (G.R. No. 192396, January 17, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that set aside Regional Trial Court (RTC)/Special Agrarian Court (SAC) orders granting a preliminary injunction.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988):** The core statute governing the case. Particularly, Sections 50, 55, 56, 57 and 68.
    *   **Section 50:** DAR has primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters, and exclusive original jurisdiction over implementation issues.
    *   **Section 55:** Explicitly prohibits courts from issuing restraining orders or preliminary injunctions against the PARC (Presidential Agrarian Reform Council) or its agencies in matters related to the application, implementation, enforcement, or interpretation of RA 6657.
    *   **Section 56:** designates the Regional Trial Court (RTC) to act as a Special Agrarian Court (SAC).
    *   **Section 57:** defines the specific jurisdiction of the SAC, which is original and exclusive over petitions for determination of just compensation to landowners, and prosecution of criminal offenses under the Act.
    *   **Section 68:** No injunction shall be issued by the lower courts against the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), the Department of Agriculture (DA), the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) in their implementation of the program.
*   **Voluntary Offer to Sell (VOS):** Landowners (Petitioners) availed of this scheme under CARP.
*   **Just Compensation:** The crux of the dispute, particularly the valuation of standing crops and improvements on the land.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **DAR:** Obligated to determine just compensation for the land acquired under CARP.
*   **LBP (Land Bank of the Philippines):** Designated as financial intermediary for CARP and responsible for valuation.
*   **Landowners (Petitioners):** Obligated to surrender land upon payment of just compensation.
*   **Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries (ARBs/Respondents):** Entitled to land ownership awards under CARP.
*   **AMS Farming Corporation (Petitioner):** Lessee/Operator of the banana plantation. Claims ownership of standing crops and improvements and therefore should be included in the valuation for just compensation.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation Dispute:** Significant difference in the valuation of the land. Petitioners claim the LBP valuation only considers the "raw land" and excludes the value of standing crops and improvements worth P16,091,885.64.
*   **"No Injunction" Rule (Sec. 55, RA 6657):** Clear statutory prohibition against injunctions against DAR, creating a significant hurdle for Petitioners.
*   **Jurisdictional Conflict:** RTC/SAC's assumption of jurisdiction over the injunction petition when the DARAB was already conducting proceedings to determine just compensation.
*   **Constitutional Rights vs. CARP Implementation:** Petitioners' argument that the "takeover" without proper valuation violates their constitutional rights to due process and just compensation. This argument has been rejected previously by courts - cited DAR v. Cuenca (2004).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657:** Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988 (cited throughout).
*   **DAR v. Cuenca (482 Phil. 208 (2004)):** Holds that controversies related to CARP implementation fall under DAR jurisdiction, even if they involve constitutional or legal issues.
*   **Malaga v. Penachos (G.R. No. 86695):** Cited by Petitioners for the proposition that exceptions can be made to prohibitions against injunctions, but distinguished by the court due to a lack of alleged irregularities in the implementation.
*   **Administrative Circular Nos. 29-2002 and 38-2002:** issued by the Supreme Court requiring lower courts to strictly observe Sections 55 and 68 of RA 6657.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Valuation Methodology:** The method used by LBP/DAR for valuing land under CARP.
*   **Interpretation of "Implementation of Agrarian Reform":** Whether the ARBs' "physical takeover" falls under this definition and triggers the "no injunction" rule.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA decision, ruling that the SAC acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing an injunction against the DAR's implementation of CARP. The Court emphasized the explicit prohibition in RA 6657 (Sec. 55 & 68) against lower courts issuing injunctions in agrarian reform matters. The Court further stated that the SAC lacked jurisdiction to entertain the Petitioners' request. Petitioners' reliance on *Malaga* was unpersuasive.
