**Case:** *Yolanda Signey vs. Social Security System, Editha Espinosa-Castillo, and Gina Servano, representative of Ginalyn and Rodelyn Signey* G.R. No. 173582, January 28, 2008 (566 Phil. 617)

**Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals decision affirming the Social Security Commission (SSC) resolution regarding the distribution of SSS death benefits. The deceased, Rodolfo Signey Sr., was survived by a legal wife (Editha Espinosa-Castillo), a common-law wife who designated as primary beneficiary (Yolanda Signey), and another common-law wife (Gina Servano) with whom he had two minor children. Yolanda Signey filed a claim for benefits, as did Gina Servano on behalf of her children (Ginalyn and Rodelyn Signey), and Editha Espinosa-Castillo claiming as the legal wife.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Beneficiary Determination:** The Supreme Court affirmed that Sections 8(e) and 8(k) of RA 8282 (SSS Law) govern beneficiary eligibility.
*   **Legal Wife:** Yolanda Signey's marriage to the deceased was deemed void due to a prior subsisting marriage between the deceased and Editha Espinosa-Castillo. Editha was not qualified for death benefits as she was cohabiting with another man.
*   **Illegitimate Children as Primary Beneficiaries:**  The Supreme Court held that Ginalyn and Rodelyn Signey, the minor children of the deceased and Gina Servano, were the rightful primary beneficiaries. Based on RA 8282 Sec. 8 (e) and (k) specifically unmarried illegitimate children under 21 are dependents irrespective of any proof that they had been dependent on the support of the deceased.
*   **Waiver of Rights:** Editha Espinosa-Castillo's waiver of rights was given little weight by the SSC because her cohabitation disqualified her from the benefits, and was deemed inconsistent with her claim of not being married to the deceased.

**Obligations:**

*   **SSS:**  The SSS has the obligation to distribute the death benefits according to the provisions of RA 8282, prioritizing dependent legal spouses and dependent minor children.
*   **Beneficiaries:**  To claim benefits, potential beneficiaries must provide substantial evidence to support their claim and meet the dependency requirements as defined in the SSS Law.

**Liabilities:**

*   No direct liabilities were established against any party. The issue revolves around entitlement to benefits, not wrongful conduct.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Dependency (Potentially Overruled by Statute):** Yolanda Signey argued that the illegitimate children did not prove their dependency on the deceased during his lifetime. The Court relied on the clear wording of Sec. 8(e) indicating illegitimate children under 21 are considered dependents, negating the need for separate proof of dependency.
*   **Validity of Prior Marriage:** Yolanda Signey failed to provide any evidence to contest the validity of the marriage between the deceased and Editha Espinosa-Castillo. Lack of challenge to the validity of the first marriage was fatal to her case.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8282 (SSS Law):**  Sections 8(e), 8(k) (definition of dependents and beneficiaries), and 13 (death benefits) are central to the decision.
*   *Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations*, 69 Phil. 635, 642-643 (1940): Defines substantial evidence in administrative proceedings.

**Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Effect of Waiver:**  The SSC did not give credence to Editha's waiver, further complicating the matter. The courts determined that the waiver was not legally consequential due to Editha's disqualification and inconsistent statements.
