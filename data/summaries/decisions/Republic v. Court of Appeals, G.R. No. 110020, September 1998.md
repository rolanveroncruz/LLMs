**Case:** *Republic of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals, et al.* G.R. No. 110020, September 25, 1998 (357 Phil. 174)

**Summary:**

This case involves a petition for review of the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision dismissing the Republic's petition for certiorari. The Republic initially filed a complaint in the RTC for rescission of a deed of sale, cancellation of titles, reconveyance, and damages, alleging a prior expropriation of the land in question. The RTC dismissed the complaint, finding the Republic had admitted the due execution and genuineness of documents (Affidavit of Revocation and Rescission of Compromise Agreement) presented by the defendants, despite the Republic not being a party to those documents. The CA dismissed the subsequent certiorari petition as an untimely appeal.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Expropriation and Compromise Agreement:** The Republic asserts it validly expropriated land from the Quetulios, evidenced by a court-approved compromise agreement and full payment of just compensation.
*   **Subsequent Sale:** Despite the prior expropriation, the Quetulios, through their attorney-in-fact Hernando, sold the property to the Abadilla spouses.
*   **Affidavit of Revocation and Rescission:** Hernando executed an Affidavit of Revocation attempting to cancel the compromise agreement, alleging non-payment of a portion of the agreed compensation. A Rescission of Compromise Agreement and Deed of Conveyance was also signed by a certain Atty. Pedro, supposedly representing the Republic.
*   **Dismissal by RTC:** The RTC dismissed the Republic's complaint based on the perceived admission of genuineness of these documents by the Republic (Rule 8, Sec. 8, Rules of Court), as the Republic didn't specifically deny them under oath.
*   **Suspended Lawyer:** Hernando, suspended from law practice at the time, represented himself and his co-defendants.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** The CA dismissed the petition for certiorari as an untimely appeal, asserting the proper remedy was an ordinary appeal.

**Obligations:**

*   **Republic's Obligation:** To uphold the court-approved Compromise Agreement.
*   **Quetulios' Obligation:** To honor the Compromise Agreement and refrain from selling the expropriated land.
*   **Abadilla Spouses' Obligation:** Good faith in acquiring property, with duty of inquiry regarding prior claims.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Hernando and Quetulios:** Potential liability for damages related to the wrongful sale of land already owned by the Republic.
*   **Abadilla Spouses:** Potential loss of property rights if the sale is declared void.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Authority of Atty. Pedro:** The authority of Atty. Sixto Pedro to bind the Republic in the "Rescission of Compromise Agreement and Deed of Conveyance" is questionable and potentially non-existent. The Supreme Court highlights that only the Solicitor General can bind the government in such matters. *Republic v. Mendoza, 125 SCRA 539 [1983]; Republic v. Polo, 89 SCRA 33 [1979].*
*   **Application of Rule 8, Sec. 8:** The application of Rule 8, Section 8, Rules of Court, is erroneous as the Republic was not a party to the Affidavit of Revocation and Rescission of Compromise Agreement. Further, failure to deny the genuineness and due execution of an actionable document does not preclude a party from arguing against it by evidence of fraud, mistake, compromise, payment, statute of limitations, estoppel and want of consideration. *I Regalado, REMEDIAL LAW COMPENDIUM, p. 105, citing I Martin 301 which cited Bough and Bough v. Cantiveros and Hanopol, 40 Phil. 209 [1919] and Hibberd v. Rohde and McMillan, 32 Phil. 476 [1915].*
*   **Status of Hernando as a Suspended Lawyer:** Hernando's representation of himself and co-defendants while under suspension constitutes unauthorized practice of law and potentially taints the proceedings. *In re David, 93 Phil. 461 [1954].*
*   **Procedural Irregularities:** The RTC's failure to rule on the Republic's motion to declare the Quetulios in default and subsequent acceptance of their answer raises concerns about impartiality and procedural due process.
*   **Laches of the OSG:** The Supreme Court noted that the OSG's filing of the petition in G.R. No. 107229 was filed nine (9) days beyond the reglementary period.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 8, Sections 7 & 8, Rules of Court:** Pleading requirements for written instruments and consequences of failure to deny genuineness and due execution.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Certiorari as a remedy for grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Art. 2038, Civil Code:** Grounds for nullity of a judicial compromise.
*   **Jurisprudence on Judicial Compromise:** *De Guzman v. Court of Appeals, 137 SCRA 730 [1985]; Hagosojos v. CA, 155 SCRA 175 [1987]*
*   **Republic v. Mendoza, 125 SCRA 539 [1983]; Republic v. Polo, 89 SCRA 33 [1979]*: Authority of the Solicitor General to bind the Republic.
*   **In re David, 93 Phil. 461 [1954]:** Prohibition against practicing law during suspension.
*   **Jurisprudence on certiorari as a substitute for a lapsed appeal:***Mejares v. Reyes, 254 SCRA 425 [1996]; Luna v. Court of Appeals, 216 SCRA 107 [1992]; Aranda v. Court of Appeals, 186 SCRA 456 [1990]; Escudero v. Dulay, 158 SCRA 69 [1988]*

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court found grave abuse of discretion by the RTC, particularly due to the erroneous application of Rule 8, Section 8, and allowing a suspended lawyer to appear. The Court GRANTED the petition, reinstated the Republic's complaint, and ordered the RTC to proceed with the case.
