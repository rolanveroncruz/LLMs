**Legal Document Summary: *Republic of the Philippines vs. Holy Trinity Realty Development Corp.***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 172410, April 14, 2008 (574 Phil. 458)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision which held that the interest accruing on a deposited amount in an expropriation case belongs to the landowner (HTRDC).

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Toll Regulatory Board (TRB)
*   **Respondent:** Holy Trinity Realty Development Corp. (HTRDC)

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Expropriation under RA 8974:**  The case concerns expropriation proceedings for a national government infrastructure project (North Luzon Expressway expansion) governed by Republic Act No. 8974.
*   **Immediate Payment (RA 8974, Sec. 4):** TRB was obligated to make "immediate payment" to HTRDC equivalent to 100% of the zonal value of the expropriated property based on BIR valuation before obtaining a writ of possession. This supersedes the deposit scheme under Rule 67.
*   **Deposit by TRB:** TRB deposited funds with Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) for affected landowners, including HTRDC.
*   **Withdrawal by HTRDC:** HTRDC was allowed to withdraw a portion of the deposit (P22,968,000.00) after proving ownership and tax payments.
*   **Interest Ownership:** The central issue is who owns the interest that accrued on the deposited funds.

**Decision:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the interest earned on the deposited amount belongs to HTRDC by right of accession (Art. 440, Civil Code).  The Court reasoned that the deposit constituted "constructive delivery" of the funds to HTRDC, making them the owner of the principal amount.  As owner of the principal, they are entitled to the civil fruits (interest).

**Liabilities and Risks:**

*   **TRB's Liability for Interest:** TRB is obligated to release the accrued interest to HTRDC pertaining to HTRDC's share of the deposit (P22,968,000.00).
*   **Rejection of TRB Arguments:** The SC rejected TRB's argument that interest claims should be determined during the "just compensation" phase, distinguishing between interest as damages for delay (which this wasn't) and interest earned on a deposited amount, which belongs to the owner of the principal. TRB's attempt to apply *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Wycoco* and *National Power Corporation v. Angas* was deemed inapplicable.
*   **DPWH as Trustee:** DPWH (Department of Public Works and Highways) is considered a trustee of the funds deposited until the landowners are allowed to withdraw them.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 8974:** Facilitates right-of-way acquisition for national infrastructure projects.
*   **Rule 67, Rules of Court:** General provisions on expropriation, superseded by RA 8974 for infrastructure projects.
*   **Article 440, Civil Code:** Right of accession to everything produced by owned property.
*   **Article 442, Civil Code:** Defines Bank interest as civil fruits.
*   **Article 1187, Civil Code** The effects of a conditional obligation to give retroact to the day the obligation was made.
*   **Republic v. Gingoyon (G.R. No. 166429):** Differentiated expropriation procedures under RA 8974 and Rule 67.
*   **Heirs of Alberto Suguitan v. City of Mandaluyong (384 Phil. 676 (2000)):** Discussed the two stages of expropriation.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Wycoco* (G.R. No. 140160) and *National Power Corporation v. Angas* (G.R. Nos. 60225-26):** These were cited by TRB but were distinguished by the Court as they concerned interest as damages for delay, not ownership of interest earned.
*   ***Union Motor Corporation v. Court of Appeals (414 Phil. 33 (2001)):** Relates to the intention to deliver on modes of effecting delivery

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The exact computation of the interest amount accruing to HTRDC's P22,968,000.00 share, and the process for LBP to remit this amount, may require further clarification.
*   The effect of Article 1187, Civil Code.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement Difficulties:**  Potential delays or disputes in enforcing the SC's order to compute and release the interest.
*   **Valuation Disputes:**  Disagreements over the precise amount of interest accrued.

**Conclusion:**

The SC's decision firmly establishes that in expropriation cases under RA 8974 involving national government infrastructure projects, landowners are entitled to the interest earned on deposited funds representing immediate payment, based on the principle of accession. TRB is obligated to facilitate the release of this interest to HTRDC.
