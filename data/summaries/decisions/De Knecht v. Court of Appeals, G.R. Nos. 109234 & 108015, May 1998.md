**Case Summary: *Cristina de Knecht and Rene Knecht vs. Hon. Court of Appeals, et al.*** (G.R. Nos. 108015 & 109234, May 20, 1998)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for annulment of judgments (G.R. No. 108015) and certiorari (G.R. No. 109234) stemming from a decades-long dispute over land in Pasay City.

**Facts:**
*   Petitioners (the Knechts) lost title to their land due to a tax sale to the Babieras and Sangalangs.  The property was subsequently sold to Salem Investment Corporation (Salem), and part of it to the Nocoms.
*   The Republic of the Philippines later expropriated the land under B.P. Blg. 340 for the EDSA extension project.
*   Previous attempts by the Knechts to reclaim the land via reconveyance (Civil Case No. 2961-P) were dismissed for failure to prosecute, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.
*   The Republic then filed Civil Case No. 7327 to determine just compensation, naming Salem and other subsequent owners as defendants, but not the Knechts.
*   The Knechts sought to intervene in the just compensation proceedings, but their motion was denied, leading to the current petitions.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

1.  **Res Judicata:** The central issue is whether the dismissal of Civil Case No. 2961-P (reconveyance) operates as *res judicata* barring the Knechts from asserting ownership or interest in the property. The court held that the dismissal for "lack of interest" was equivalent to failure to prosecute under Rule 17, Section 3, and thus constituted an adjudication on the merits, precluding further litigation on the ownership issue.
    *   *Relevant Law:* Rule 17, Section 3, Revised Rules of Court; Elements of *res judicata*
    *   *Potential Risk:*  Continued attempts to litigate ownership will likely be barred under res judicata.
2.  **Intervention in Expropriation Proceedings (Civil Case No. 7327):**  The Court of Appeals erred in ruling this was not an expropriation case. The SC clarifies it was the exercise of the state's power of eminent domain under B.P. 340. However, the Knechts were correctly denied intervention because their prior claim of ownership was extinguished by *res judicata* resulting from Civil Case No. 2961-P. Only persons with a current legal interest (registered owners, lessees, mortgagees) are entitled to intervention. Mere possession after a finalized adverse ownership judgment is insufficient.
    *   *Relevant Law:* Rule 67, Section 1, Revised Rules of Court (Eminent Domain), B.P. Blg. 340.
    *   *Potential Risk:*  If the dismissal of 2961-P is ever overturned the Knechts may have grounds to claim compensation in the expropriation.
3.  **Notice of Tax Sale:**  Knechts claimed lack of notice of tax delinquency and auction sale. The Court acknowledged that proper notice is mandatory but considered this a factual issue already litigated and barred by *res judicata*.
    *   *Relevant Law:* Local Government Code provisions on tax sales and notice requirements (though not explicitly cited, this is the governing area of law).  The Knechts relied on this alleged lack of notice in previous cases.
    *   *Potential Risk:* This point is vulnerable. If the dismissal in Civil Case No. 2961-P is challenged, the lack of notice claim may be viable.
4.  **Expropriation & "Just Compensation":** The Republic's right to expropriate under B.P. Blg. 340 was upheld in a previous case (G.R. No. 87335). The current issue focuses on who is entitled to "just compensation" for that expropriation. The Knechts' claim for compensation was contingent on their ownership, which was previously resolved against them.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision denying the Knechts' intervention in the just compensation proceedings (Civil Case No. 7327) and denying the petition for annulment of judgement.
*   The Petition in G.R. No. 109234 is dismissed and the Motion for Reconsideration in G.R. No. 108015 is denied. The decisions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 27817 and CA-G.R. SP No. 28089 are affirmed.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "lack of interest" in the dismissal order of Civil Case No. 2961-P as equivalent to "failure to prosecute" under Rule 17, Section 3 is arguably strict, particularly as it triggers *res judicata*.

**Potential Liabilities/Risks:**

*   The Knechts face continued dispossession and no compensation for the expropriated land. The only potential avenue for relief would involve successfully challenging the dismissal of Civil Case No. 2961-P, but it is likely too late to do this.

**Recommendations:**

*   Further litigating this case would likely be unproductive due to the strong application of *res judicata*. If new evidence could prove actual fraud or lack of due process in the initial tax sale, a potential legal avenue may exist, though it is unlikely to succeed at this stage.
