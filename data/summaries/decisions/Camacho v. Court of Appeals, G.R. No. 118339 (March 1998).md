## Legal Document Summary: *Camacho v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 118339, March 19, 1998

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision resolving a dispute regarding the enforceability of a trial court judgment via motion after five years from its finality.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Original Judgment:** Trial court (CFI Bataan) ruled in favor of respondents (Dizon, et al.) in a specific performance action against petitioner (Camacho), ordering her to segregate and transfer titles to respondents based on deeds of sale. Affirmed by CA with modification; Petition for Review denied by SC.
*   **Motion for Execution:** Respondents moved for execution; Petitioner moved to defer based on lack of approved subdivision plan and boundary indeterminacy.
*   **Subsequent Events:** Writ issued, appeal denied. Title issues, transfers to petitioner's daughter, and new counsel representation complicated and delayed enforcement. Multiple motions and incidents arose with the case sitting inactive due to retirements, leaving motions unresolved.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** Trial court held it lacked jurisdiction due to the lapse of five years from entry of judgment, effectively denying respondents' motion for implementation and viewing it as requiring an alias writ applied for outside the prescribed period.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** CA reversed the trial court, holding that periods where execution was stayed due to petitioner's actions (motion to defer, appeals) and court vacancies should not be included in the five-year period. Remanded for further proceedings.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** SC affirmed the CA. Ruled that the five-year period for execution by motion was effectively interrupted or suspended due to petitioner's dilatory actions and circumstances beyond respondents' control.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner (Camacho, now her estate/daughter Aurora Fe):** Obligated to comply with the original judgment, specifically to segregate and transfer titles to respondents.
*   **Respondents (Dizon, et al.):** Obligated to pursue execution diligently, but their inactivity was excused by the Court due to circumstances caused by the petitioner.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner (Estate of Camacho) bears the costs of the appeal.
*   Failure to comply with the judgment, especially the transfer of titles, could lead to further contempt or other enforcement proceedings.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Further delays in execution could result in prejudice to Respondents if the property values change significantly.
*   Legal challenges by Petitioner's Estate contesting the validity of the deeds of sale or raising other issues related to the property ownership could further complicate the execution.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Sec. 6, Rule 39, Rules of Court:** Governing execution of judgments on motion within five years.
*   **_Gonzales v. Court of Appeals_, G.R. No. 62556, 212 SCRA 595:** Invoked the principle of equity in computing the 5-year period, excluding delays not attributable to the prevailing party.
*   **_Republic v. Court of Appeals_, G.R. No. 91885, 260 SCRA 344:** Allowed execution by motion after five years due to the judgment debtor's actions causing the delay.
*   **Section 2, Rule 1, Rules of Court:** Directing liberal construction of the rules.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Identification of specific portions to be segregated:** The initial motion to defer execution raised the issue of boundary indeterminacy. While the CA previously ruled that the lots sold were identifiable, this may be revived in enforcement proceedings.
*   **Transfer of titles to petitioner's daughter:** The transfer of the titles to Aurora Fe raises the issue of *lis pendens* and whether Aurora Fe is bound by the original judgment. The Court did not definitively rule on the daughter's obligation to surrender titles.
*   **Ongoing nature of "further proceedings" after remand:** The specific actions required on remand are not defined, which could open the door for new challenges from the Petitioner's Estate.
*   **Equity Arguments:** The Court relied heavily on equity; continued reliance may be subject to judicial discretion and interpretation, creating potential uncertainty in enforcement.
