**Case Summary: People v. Malolot, G.R. No. 174063 (2008)**

**Nature:** This case involves automatic review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming with modifications the RTC conviction of brothers Edgardo and Elmer Malolot for Attempted Murder (Crim. Case No. 98-627), Frustrated Murder (Crim. Case No. 98-628), and Murder (Crim. Case No. 98-629) arising from a single incident on June 23, 1998.

**Facts:** The Malolots attacked the Mabelin family, resulting in injuries to Jovelyn (Attempted Murder), Junbert (Frustrated Murder), and the death of infant Jonathan (Murder). The altercations stemmed from a prior argument involving the wives. Both Malolots were originally convicted of all three crimes by the RTC.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Attempted Murder (Jovelyn):** Edgardo's conviction for Attempted Murder of Jovelyn was affirmed but Elmer was acquitted due to lack of evidence of conspiracy. The CA originally affirmed exemplary damages, but the Supreme Court deleted these due to lack of aggravating circumstances specific to Edgardo's individual conduct.
*   **Frustrated Murder (Junbert):** Both Elmer and Edgardo's conviction for Frustrated Murder of Junbert was affirmed. Dwelling was found as an aggravating circumstance and thus the exemplary damages were reduced to P20,000 from P40,000.
*   **Murder (Jonathan):** Both Elmer and Edgardo's conviction for Murder of Jonathan was affirmed. Due to RA 9346 (prohibiting the death penalty), the sentence was reduced to Reclusion Temporal Maximum to Reclusion Perpetua. Dwelling was found as an aggravating circumstance and the exemplary damages were reduced to P25,000 from P50,000.
*   **Conspiracy:** The Court found sufficient evidence of conspiracy for the Frustrated Murder of Junbert and the Murder of Jonathan based on Elmer and Edgardo's actions and proximity during the attacks.
*   **Treachery:** Treachery was properly appreciated because the victims were minors and therefore unable to mount a defense. *Fallorina, 468 Phil. 816, 840 (2004)*. The allegation of disregard of age was absorbed in the qualifying circumstance of treachery.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** Dwelling was an aggravating circumstance to the frustrated murder of Junbert and the murder of Jonathan under Art. 14, RPC.
*   **Witness Credibility:** The Court upheld the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, dismissing arguments regarding inconsistencies in Bernadette's testimony because they pertained to peripheral matters. *Gamiao, 310 Phil. 252, 261 (1995)*

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Edgardo Malolot:** Liable for Attempted Murder (imprisonment: 4 years, 2 months, and 1 day to 9 years), Frustrated Murder (imprisonment: 10 years and 1 day to 20 years, civil liabilities), and Murder (imprisonment: 20 years to 40 years, civil liabilities).
*   **Elmer Malolot:** Liable for Frustrated Murder (imprisonment: 10 years and 1 day to 20 years, civil liabilities), and Murder (imprisonment: 20 years to 40 years, civil liabilities).
*   **Joint & Several Liability:** The Malolots are jointly and severally liable for civil damages awarded for Frustrated Murder and Murder.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Parole Ineligibility:** RA 9346 prohibits parole for those sentenced to Reclusion Perpetua, potentially impacting Elmer and Edgardo's prospects for early release.
*   **Factual Disputes:** The decision hinges heavily on the prosecution's version of events, highlighting the importance of witness credibility and the potential for reasonable doubt, especially concerning Elmer's participation in the attempted murder.
*   **Subjectivity in Conspiracy:** The court's determination of conspiracy is based on circumstantial evidence and inferences drawn from the appellants' actions, opening the door to challenges based on alternative interpretations of the facts.
* **Assessment of damages:** The amount of damages such as moral damages and exemplary damages awarded are subject to judicial discretion.
