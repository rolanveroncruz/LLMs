**Legal Document Summary: Toring v. Ganzon-Olan, G.R. No. 168782 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's order for petitioners to pay respondents P20,000,000 representing a loan and accrued interest.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan Agreement:** Petitioners obtained a P6,000,000 loan from respondents on September 4, 1998, secured by a real estate mortgage.
*   **Interest Rate:** Initially stipulated at 3% per month in the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage.
*   **Deed of Absolute Sale & Option to Buy:** Subsequently, a Deed of Absolute Sale and Option to Buy were executed.  These were later reformed to be treated as an equitable mortgage, with the "escalating purchase price" under the Option to Buy deemed interest.
*   **Reformed Agreement:** Parties agreed the transaction was an equitable mortgage, not a sale.
*   **Dispute:** The main issue is the validity of the 3% and 3.81% monthly interest rates.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners (Torings):** Original borrower; obligated to repay the principal loan amount plus interest.  Must pay P10,000,000.00 principal plus interest.
*   **Respondents (Ganzon-Olans):** Lender, entitled to repayment of principal and reasonable interest.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable for the principal loan. The initial high interest rates are deemed unconscionable.
*   Court ruled original stipulated interest rate of 3% or 3.81% per month was excessive.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Usury:** While Central Bank Circular No. 905-82 suspended the Usury Law ceiling, courts retain the power to deem interest rates unconscionable.
*   **Enforceability of Reformed Agreement:** The reformed equitable mortgage (from Deed of Absolute Sale and Option to Buy) introduces ambiguity as to the exact terms of the loan repayment and how it correlates with the original loan document.
*   **Damages Waiver:** Parties waived all claims for damages, limiting the scope of the legal issues.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Art. 1602:** Governs equitable mortgages and provides that proceeds from the "sale" shall be considered interest and subject to usury laws.
*   **Civil Code Art. 1956:** Stipulates that interest must be expressly stipulated in writing.
*   **Central Bank Circular No. 905-82:** Suspended the ceiling on interest rates; however, the Supreme Court has maintained the right to temper unconscionable rates.
*   **Ruiz v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 146942 (2003):**  Cited by the court in reducing the interest rate.  Held that CB Circular 905 does not grant lenders carte blanche authority to charge unconscionable rates.
*   **Bundalian v. Court of Appeals, No. L-55739 (1984):** Stipulations escalating repurchase price are for securing money with profit.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The escalation of purchase price within the "Option to Buy" document needs clarification, it acts as a de facto interest rate.
*   The reformation of the "Deed of Absolute Sale" and the "Option to Buy" into an equitable mortgage, while agreed upon, may introduce ambiguity and could be contested regarding the exact terms.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *modified* the Court of Appeals' decision, reducing the stipulated interest rate to 1% per month from December 6, 1998, until the principal is fully paid.
