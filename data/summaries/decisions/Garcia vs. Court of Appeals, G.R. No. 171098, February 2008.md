## Legal Document Summary: Garcia, Jr. vs. Court of Appeals and Garcia Pasion Development Corporation (GPDC)

**Case:** G.R. No. 171098, February 26, 2008 (Third Division)

**Subject:** Petition for Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' dismissal of petitioners' (Garcia, Jr. & Gaerlan) Petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 90178.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Rule 65, Section 1, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Mandates that a petition for certiorari be accompanied by a certified true copy of the judgment, order, or resolution being challenged.
*   **Rule 46, Section 3, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Requires cases originally filed in the Court of Appeals to be accompanied by a clearly legible duplicate original or certified true copy of the judgment, order, resolution, or ruling subject thereof.
*   **Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96:** Clarifies the definition of "duplicate original copy" and "certified true copy," emphasizing the requirement of authentication (signature, initials, dry seal) and clear legibility.
*   **Supreme Court Circular No. 13-92 & 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court:** Establishes guidelines for deposits and withdrawals of court fiduciary funds, requiring deposits to be made in the name of the Court.

**Background:**

*   Petitioners, stockholders of GPDC, were defendants in a derivative suit (SP. Proc. No. 03-106410) filed by GPDC.
*   Parties jointly moved the RTC to direct dividends due to GPDC (from Kenram Philippines, Inc. and Kenram Industrial Development, Inc.) to be delivered to the Branch Clerk of Court for deposit in a GPDC account, with withdrawals requiring court approval.
*   RTC initially directed dividends to the Office of the Clerk of Court.
*   RTC denied a subsequent Joint Motion to amend this order, citing Section 2.1.2 of the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court, which requires deposits to be in the name of the Court.
*   Petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari in the Court of Appeals.

**Court of Appeals' Action & Rationale:**

*   Dismissed the Petition for Certiorari due to the petitioners' failure to attach certified true copies of the RTC orders (dated 22 February 2005 and 7 April 2005), violating Rule 65, Section 1.
*   Rejected the Joint Motion for Reconsideration.
*   Found that attaching machine copies of the assailed orders did not satisfy the rule.

**Supreme Court Decision & Rationale:**

*   Dismissed the Petition for Certiorari filed by Garcia, Jr.
*   Affirmed the Court of Appeals' dismissal, emphasizing strict adherence to procedural rules.
*   Held that failure to attach certified true copies (or duplicate originals) is sufficient grounds for dismissal.
*   Reiterated that a certified true copy is not a mere photocopy and requires proper authentication.
*   Rejected the argument for liberal application of rules, finding no justifiable cause.
*   Dismissed petitioners' request to direct the Branch Clerk of Court to open an account in the name of GPDC, citing Supreme Court Circular No. 13-92 and the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court, which mandate deposits to be in the name of the Court.

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   **Dismissal for Non-Compliance:** Failure to strictly adhere to procedural rules, especially regarding the form and authentication of attached documents (certified true copies or duplicate originals), can lead to dismissal of the case.
*   **Lack of Substantial Justice:** Over-reliance on technicalities without considering the merits of the case can result in a denial of substantial justice.
*   **Fiduciary Duty Violation:** Failure to comply with the rules regarding the deposit and management of court fiduciary funds could expose the Clerk of Court or the RTC to potential liabilities.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The reliance on procedural rules over the merits of the underlying derivative suit could be viewed as contentious, especially given the joint motion by both parties.
*   The insistence on strict compliance despite the possibility of easily rectifying the deficiency (by submitting certified true copies) could be questioned.
*   The RTC's rationale for denying the requested amendment based on the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court, while technically correct, could be seen as prioritizing administrative procedure over the efficient handling of corporate dividends in a derivative suit.
