**Legal Document Summary: Vergara v. The Hon. Ombudsman, G.R. No. 174567, March 12, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus assailing the Ombudsman's dismissal of a complaint for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Key Provisions:**
*   **Purchase of Land:** Calamba City, through Mayor Lajara, purchased land from Pamana, Inc. for a new city hall site based on City Council Resolutions.
*   **Agreements:** Execution of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), Deed of Sale, Deed of Real Estate Mortgage, and Deed of Assignment of Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA).
*   **Allegations of Irregularities:** Petitioner alleged that certain TCTs were registered under the name of Philippine Sugar Estates Development Company (PSEDC) and neither Pamana nor Prudential Bank owned these properties; certain TCTs are road lots that cannot be closed or disposed of without the prior approval of the National Housing Authority and the conformity of the duly organized homeowners' association; and the purchase included road lots and an access road to Bacnotan Steel Corporation and Danlex Corporation were included in the Deed of Sale.
*   **Ombudsman's Dismissal:** No probable cause found to hold respondents liable under Section 3(e) of RA 3019. The Ombudsman stated that the city bought the property at a reasonable price and was able to immediately take possession of the lots even if it had paid only less than ten percent of the contract price. The Ombudsman also stated that the various actions performed by Mayor Lajara in connection with the purchase of the lots were all authorized by the Sangguniang Panlungsod as manifested in the numerous resolutions.

**Obligations:**
*   **Calamba City:** Obligated to pay Pamana, Inc. for the purchased land as per the terms of the MOA, secured by a mortgage and assignment of IRA.
*   **Mayor Lajara:** Obligated to act within the authority granted by the City Council Resolutions.

**Liabilities:**
*   Petitioner sought to establish the liability of Mayor Lajara, City Treasurer Baroro, Pamana, Inc. President Requesto, and Prudential Bank Vice President Jocson for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.

**Potential Risks:**
*   **Lack of Ratification:** Although the Court finds that prior authorization is sufficient under Section 22(c), Title I of RA 7160, the absence of ratification by the City Council of the executed documents may raise questions of procedural compliance with local government regulations.
*   **Inclusion of Road Lots and Access Roads in the Deed of Sale:** The inclusion of these may raise questions of whether Calamba City should have paid for the road lots at the same price per square meter.
*   **Continued challenges to the purchase:** The land purchase could be subject to further scrutiny if new evidence emerges regarding overpricing or other irregularities, potentially leading to civil suits for damages or rescission of the contracts.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **RA 3019, Section 3(e):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. The central law in question, prohibiting public officials from causing undue injury to any party or giving unwarranted benefits in the discharge of their functions.
*   **RA 6770, Section 13 & 15:** The Ombudsman Act of 1989, vesting the Ombudsman with investigatory and prosecutorial powers.
*   **RA 7160, Section 22(c) & 455:** Local Government Code of 1991, regarding the corporate powers of local government units and the powers of the local chief executive.  The case clarifies that *prior authorization*, not ratification, by the *sanggunian* is required for the local chief executive to enter into contracts.
*   **Constitution, Article XI, Section 12 & 13:** Regarding the powers, functions, and duties of the Office of the Ombudsman.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Interpretation of "Prior Authorization":** While the Court states that prior authorization is sufficient, the precise scope and limitations of that authorization, and the degree of scrutiny required in determining its validity, are subject to interpretation.
*   **Valuation of land:** The determination of fair market value is contentious.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Ombudsman's dismissal based on the lack of probable cause for a violation of RA 3019, Section 3(e), stating that no undue injury to the government had been demonstrated. The court also clarified that prior authorization by the Sangguniang Panlungsod, as stipulated in Section 22 of RA 7160, is sufficient and that ratification of the contract by the City Council is not required.
