**Case Summary: Mendoza v. Paule and Dela Cruz v. Paule (G.R. Nos. 175885 and 176271)**

**Nature of the Document:** Consolidated Supreme Court decision resolving disputes arising from a National Irrigation Administration (NIA) project undertaken by E.M. Paule Construction and Trading (EMPCT), represented by Zenaida Mendoza through a Special Power of Attorney (SPA).

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **SPA & Agency:** Paule granted Mendoza an SPA to represent EMPCT in dealings with NIA, including bidding and collecting payments.  Mendoza then contracted with Dela Cruz for heavy equipment rental.  Paule later revoked the SPA.  A second SPA with broader powers was granted to Mendoza after Cruz filed suit.
*   **Partnership:** The Court found the existence of a partnership between Paule and Mendoza for the NIA project. Paule contributed his contractor's license, while Mendoza was responsible for funding, sourcing labor, and managing supplier relationships. Paule's share was 3% of the project cost, with the remainder going to Mendoza.
*   **Contractual Disputes:** Dela Cruz sued Paule and NIA for unpaid equipment rental. Paule filed a third-party complaint against Mendoza, who filed a cross-claim for damages due to the SPA revocation.
*   **Prior Case (G.R. No. 173275):**  The Supreme Court had previously affirmed a Court of Appeals decision finding Paule liable as Mendoza's principal under the same SPAs for unpaid obligations incurred by Mendoza with other parties.  This was given res judicata effect.
*   **Revocation of SPA:** The central issue revolves around the validity and consequences of Paule's revocation of the SPA. The court found the revocation to be in bad faith, especially given the existing obligations and the partnership agreement.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Paule's Liability to Dela Cruz:** The Court found Paule liable to Dela Cruz for unpaid equipment rental, based on agency principles and res judicata from the prior case (G.R. No. 173275).  Mendoza was acting within the scope of her apparent authority.
*   **Paule's Liability to Mendoza:** Paule is liable to Mendoza for damages arising from the bad-faith revocation of the SPA. The trial court must receive evidence on Mendoza's counterclaim (originally mislabeled as a cross-claim).  Moral damages are appropriate.
*   **No Liability for NIA or Coloma** The document does not impose liability on the NIA or Coloma (Acting Project Manager).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Scope of SPA:** While the SPAs initially appeared limited, the Court construed them broadly in light of the partnership agreement and Paule's subsequent actions, especially in regard to the second broader SPA executed.
*   **Valuation of Damages:**  The exact amount of damages owed to Mendoza is uncertain and depends on the evidence to be presented before the trial court.
*   **Partnership vs. Agency:** The interplay between partnership and agency principles is key. The Court appears to be using the partnership as a framework to expand the scope of Paule's liability under the SPAs.
*   **Article 1920, Civil Code:**  The Court of Appeals incorrectly relied on Article 1920, which allows principals to revoke an agency at will. The Supreme Court determined that the SPA was tied to a bilateral contract (the partnership) and could not be revoked under the circumstances. This references Article 1927 of the Civil Code regarding instances where an agency cannot be revoked.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles:**  The decision heavily relies on provisions of the Civil Code relating to agency (specifically Articles 1868, 1881, 1920, and 1927), partnership (Article 1818 and 1801) and damages.
*   **Manila Memorial Park Cemetery, Inc. v. Linsangan (G.R. No. 151319):**  Cited by the Court of Appeals regarding the principal not being bound by the acts of an agent exceeding authority, which the Supreme Court found inapplicable.
*   **Heirs of Clemencia Parasac v. Republic (G.R. No. 159910):** Cited regarding the identity of issues in res judicata.
*   **Pinga v. Heirs of German Santiago (G.R. No. 170354):** Cited concerning the dismissal of counterclaims.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals, finding Paule liable to both Dela Cruz and Mendoza. Paule's liability is grounded in agency principles, the partnership agreement, and his bad-faith revocation of the SPA. The case is remanded to the trial court to determine the specific amount of damages owed to Mendoza. The key takeaway is that the existence of a partnership significantly expanded the scope of liability beyond the literal terms of the SPA, and the doctrine of *res judicata* played a decisive role due to a previous ruling between the parties concerning the same SPA.
