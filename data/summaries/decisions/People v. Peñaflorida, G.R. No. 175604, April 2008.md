Here's a legal summary of *People v. Peñaflorida*, G.R. No. 175604:

**Case Summary: *People v. Peñaflorida***

**Facts:** Salvador Peñaflorida was convicted of transporting marijuana in violation of Section 4, Article II of R.A. No. 6425 (The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972), as amended by R.A. No. 7659, based on a tip received by police. Police officers intercepted him while he was riding a bicycle carrying a package later found to contain marijuana. The RTC and CA upheld the conviction.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Illegal transport of marijuana under R.A. 6425, Sec. 4, as amended. Elements include unauthorized transport of prohibited drug.
*   **Defense Arguments:**
    *   Insufficient information from asset; asset should have been presented.
    *   Invalid warrantless arrest.
    *   Lack of knowledge about package contents (no *animus possidendi*).
    *   Chain of custody issues regarding the seized marijuana.
*   **Prosecution's Response:**
    *   Tip specifically named Peñaflorida.
    *   Asset’s testimony corroborative only and not indispensable. Protection of informant trumps presentation as witness.
    *   Warrantless arrest justified as *in flagrante delicto*.
    *   Knowledge of the contents not necessary as offense is *mala prohibita*.
    *   Chain of custody sufficiently established.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.

**Key Legal Principles & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6425, Sec. 4 (as amended by R.A. 7659):**  Governs illegal sale, administration, delivery, distribution, and transportation of prohibited drugs. Prescribes *reclusion perpetua* to death and a fine.
*   **Warrantless Arrest (In Flagrante Delicto):** The Court upheld the warrantless arrest as valid because the appellant was caught *in flagrante delicto* transporting the marijuana.  The police had probable cause.
*   ***Animus Possidendi*:** The Court determined that appellant failed to adequately establish lack of knowledge of the package contents, thus inferring intent to possess the marijuana.
*   ***Mala Prohibita*:** The offense is *mala prohibita*, meaning the act is inherently illegal regardless of intent or knowledge.
*   **Plain View Doctrine:** The marijuana was visible in the basket of the accused, falling under this exception to the warrant requirement.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliability of the Tip:** While the Court accepted the validity of the tip, a more detailed examination of the asset's reliability and past performance could have been beneficial, especially given the lack of a warrant.
*   **Defense of Lack of Knowledge:**  The court dismissed the lack of knowledge argument easily. In cases of unwitting transportation, a strong defense can be built demonstrating lack of knowledge.

**Case Law:**

*   **People v. Libag:** Distinguished. In *Libag*, the informant was a poseur-buyer and his testimony indispensable.  Here, the informant's role was limited to providing the initial tip.
*   **People v. Del Mundo:** Cited regarding the meaning of "transport" and the non-necessity of presenting an informant.
*   **People v. Mateo:** Cited regarding the referral of automatic review cases to the Court of Appeals.

**Conclusion:**

The court based the ruling primarily on the *in flagrante delicto* justification for the warrantless arrest and the *mala prohibita* nature of the crime, placing the burden on the defendant to prove his lack of intent.
