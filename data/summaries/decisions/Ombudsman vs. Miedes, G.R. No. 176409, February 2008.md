**Case Summary: *Office of the Ombudsman v. Rolando S. Miedes, Sr.*, G.R. No. 176409 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision modifying the penalty imposed by the Ombudsman for Simple Misconduct.

**Facts:**

*   Respondent Miedes, as a member of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), was administratively charged with violations stemming from the irregular procurement of cellular phones without public bidding.
*   The Ombudsman found Miedes guilty of Simple Misconduct and imposed a three-month suspension.
*   The CA affirmed the finding of Simple Misconduct but reduced the penalty to a one-month suspension, citing the absence of corrupt motive.
*   The Ombudsman sought intervention in the CA proceedings after the decision to partially reconsider. CA denied Omnibus Motion for Intervention and Partial Reconsideration.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

1.  **Simple Misconduct vs. Grave Misconduct:** The Court clarified the distinction between Grave and Simple Misconduct. Grave Misconduct requires elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of rules, while Simple Misconduct does not. The absence of corrupt motive was a key factor in downgrading the offense to Simple Misconduct.
2.  **Propriety of the CA's Reduction of Penalty:** The central legal issue is whether the CA erred in further mitigating the penalty for Simple Misconduct based on the *same* absence of corrupt motive that downgraded the offense from Grave to Simple Misconduct. The Ombudsman argued that this constitutes double application of the mitigating circumstance.
3.  **Propriety of the Ombudsman's Intervention:** The court ruled that it was error to not allow the Ombudsman to intervene after the CA's decision but before it was final, given the patent error in the penalty modification.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court **partly granted** the petition, reversing the CA's decision to reduce the penalty. The Court held that the absence of corrupt motive had already been considered in downgrading the offense and could not be re-applied as a mitigating factor in determining the penalty for Simple Misconduct. Miedes was ordered suspended for three months, as originally imposed by the Ombudsman.

**Statutory and Regulatory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 3019, Section 3(e) (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act)
*   Presidential Decree No. 1445 (Government Auditing Code of the Philippines)
*   Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 1999
*   Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Section 54 (Manner of Imposition of Penalties)
*   Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Section 52(B)(2)
*   Rules of Court (on Intervention)

**Case Law Cited:**

*   *Director of Lands v. Court of Appeals* (Intervention Allowed in SC)
*   *Tahanan Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals* (Late Intervention Allowed)
*   *Mago v. Court of Appeals* (Intervention Allowed After Finality)
*   *Pinlac v. Court of Appeals* (Intervention Allowed After Decision and Denial of Reconsideration)

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The interpretation and application of mitigating circumstances in administrative cases, specifically whether a factor already used to downgrade an offense can be used again to mitigate the penalty.
*   The CA's original reliance on the absence of corrupt motive potentially sets a precedent for excessive mitigation of penalties in Simple Misconduct cases.

**Obligations:**

Respondent Miedes has an obligation to serve the three-month suspension imposed by the Ombudsman. The Civil Service Commission has an obligation to implement the decision.
