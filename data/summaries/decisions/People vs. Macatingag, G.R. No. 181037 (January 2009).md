## Legal Document Summary: People v. Macatingag, G.R. No. 181037 (2009)

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) â€“ Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, R.A. No. 9165:** Defines and penalizes the sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution, and transportation of dangerous drugs. It establishes penalties ranging from life imprisonment to death and fines from P500,000 to P10,000,000.

*   **Section 21, Article II, R.A. No. 9165:** Outlines the procedure for the custody and disposition of confiscated drugs, including inventory, photography, laboratory examination, and destruction.

**Facts:** Appellant was caught in a buy-bust operation selling 25.23 grams of *shabu*.  The prosecution presented testimonies from the poseur-buyer and arresting officer. The defense claimed frame-up.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding the trial court's conviction of the appellant.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellant is obligated to serve life imprisonment and pay a fine of P500,000.
*   Apprehending team had the obligation to follow chain of custody procedures

**Liabilities:**

*   Appellant is liable for violating Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody (Sec. 21, R.A. 9165):** The defense argued non-compliance with Sec. 21. The Court acknowledged potential deviations but upheld the conviction because the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drug was preserved. This presents a potential risk if future cases involving similar deviations might be viewed differently if integrity is less definitively established.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court relied heavily on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties by the police officers.  This can be a contentious point as it places a significant burden on the defense to prove otherwise.
*   **Warrantless Arrest:**  The Court upheld the legality of the warrantless arrest due to the buy-bust operation, falling under the *in flagrante delicto* exception.  This is standard doctrine, but the validity hinges on the proper execution of the buy-bust.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People of the Philippines v. Del Monte, G.R. No. 179940, April 23, 2008:** Clarifies that non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 affects the evidentiary weight, not admissibility, of the evidence.
*   **People of the Philippines v. Naquita, G.R. No. 180511, July 28, 2008:** Affirms that non-compliance with Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 will not render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized/confiscated from him inadmissible.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002)**
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 63(2):** Concerns the application of indivisible penalties, the lesser penalty shall be applied

**Ambiguous/Contentious Areas:**

* The decision emphasizes the preservation of the *integrity* of evidence over strict procedural compliance with Sec. 21, RA 9165. This introduces a degree of subjectivity, as "integrity" can be open to interpretation. Future cases might hinge on how stringently "integrity" is defined and proven.
