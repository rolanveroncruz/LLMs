Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court Decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Hagedorn, et al. vs. Commission on Audit (COA)*, G.R. No. 260458, June 4, 2024

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65, seeking to set aside COA Decision No. 2021-247.  Includes a request for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction.

**Issue:** Whether COA committed grave abuse of discretion in disallowing the EVSIP payments under Ordinance No. 438 and related resolutions, and finding the petitioners liable for the amounts paid.

**Ruling:** Petition dismissed, TRO/Injunction denied.  The Court upheld the COA's disallowance and declared Ordinance No. 500 also null and void for being ultra vires. Records are forwarded to the Office of the Ombudsman for investigation into the good faith of the Petitioners

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Early and Voluntary Separation Incentive Program (EVSIP):**  Puerto Princesa City Ordinance No. 438 (amended by Ordinance No. 500) and Resolution No. 850-2010 established an EVSIP offering incentives to separating employees based on years of service (multiplied by a factor), in addition to other benefits.
*   **COA's Disallowance:** The COA disallowed payments under the EVSIP (Notices of Disallowance Nos. 13-057-100 (2011) to 13-150-100 (2012)), totaling PHP 89,672,400.74, deeming it an illegal supplementary retirement plan.
*   **Petitioners' Arguments:**  The Petitioners argued that the COA acted with grave abuse of discretion, the Ordinance was valid, they acted in good faith implementing a presumed-valid ordinance, and the EVSIP was not a supplementary plan prohibited under Republic Act No. 4968 and Commonwealth Act No. 186.
*   **COA's Arguments:**  The COA argued that the EVSIP was an invalid supplementary retirement plan not authorized by law, particularly Section 28(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 186, and that officials involved were liable for the illegal expenditure and are obligated to return these under the principle of solutio indebiti.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Commonwealth Act No. 186 (as amended by RA 4968):**  Prohibits supplementary retirement or pension plans other than the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). *Core reason for disallowance*.
*   **Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991):** Discussed Section 76 on organizational structure and staffing pattern.
*   **Republic Act No. 386 (Civil Code of the Philippines):**  Article 2154 on *solutio indebiti* (obligation to return what was unduly received).
*   **Bayron v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 253127, November 29, 2022:** *Critical precedent*.  The Supreme Court in *Bayron* already declared Ordinance No. 438 and Resolution No. 850-2010 null and void for being *ultra vires* and contrary to Section 28(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 186.
*   **Municipality of Tupi v. Faustino, 860 Phil. 363 (2019):** Discusses the metes and bounds of the operative fact doctrine.
*   **Araullo v. Aquino, 752 Phil. 716 (2015):**  Discusses good faith in the application of the operative fact doctrine.
*   **Other cases:** Discussion of the power of the Sangguniang Panlungsod.
*   **Other statutes**: Discusses separation pay of a government employee on account of reorganisation and mandates the separation pay to be "one (1) month salary for every year of service."

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Solidary Liability:**  COA asserts that public officials responsible for the illegal expenditures, as well as the recipients of the benefits, are jointly and severally liable for the full amount.
*   **Good Faith Defense:** The Court defers the determination of good faith to the Office of the Ombudsman.  Lack of good faith will result in liability for the officials involved.
*   **Office of the Ombudsman investigation:** The Court directs the transmittal of records to the Ombudsman for investigation of potential criminal, civil, and administrative liabilities.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Operative Fact Doctrine:**  The Court applies the operative fact doctrine, meaning actions taken under the invalidated ordinance *may* have legal effect, *but only* if the relevant actors (officials and recipients) acted in good faith. This determination is crucial and unresolved.
*   **Definition of "Supplementary Retirement Plan":**  The core dispute revolves around whether the EVSIP constitutes a prohibited "supplementary retirement plan" under CA 186. The Court's interpretation is very broad in this regard, viewing any benefit linked to years of service as falling within the prohibition.

**Potential Issues & Further Analysis:**

*   **Impact of *Bayron* Decision:**  The *Bayron* decision is dispositive on the issue of the ordinance's validity, making the Petitioners' challenge difficult.
*   **Good Faith Determination:** The Ombudsman's investigation is critical. The petitioners will need to demonstrate they relied on the advice of counsel, reasonably interpreted the ordinance as valid, and did not act with gross negligence or malice.
*   **Recovery of Funds:**  Even if good faith is established, the government may still seek to recover funds from recipients under *solutio indebiti*.
*   **Scope of *Ultra Vires*:** The decision emphasizes the limited powers of local government units. The EVSIP may be seen as an attempt to circumvent limitations on retirement benefits.
*   **Impact of amendments:** The court also nullified ordinance No. 500 which amended the required years of service and retroactive payments.

This summary provides a lawyer with the crucial information needed to understand the case, its holding, the underlying legal issues, and potential risks and liabilities for the petitioners.
