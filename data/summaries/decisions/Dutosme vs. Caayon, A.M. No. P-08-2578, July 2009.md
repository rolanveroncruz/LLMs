## Legal Document Summary: Dutosme v. Caayon, A.M. No. P-08-2578

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Rey D. Caayon, Branch Clerk of Court, RTC Branch 61, Bogo, Cebu, for soliciting and receiving unauthorized fees.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Complainant's Claim:** Dutosme alleges that Atty. Caayon solicited and received P2,500 for "commissioner's and stenographer's fees" for a copy of a decision, without issuing an official receipt. He was given a handwritten receipt.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Atty. Caayon claims he received the money in trust for Belle Garrido, the court stenographer, after Dutosme insisted he accept it. He alleges Dutosme did not return for the official receipt. He submitted certifications from stenographers claiming receipt of the money from him for TSNs.
*   **OCA Finding:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) found Atty. Caayon liable for exacting unauthorized fees. They gave more weight to the complainant's sworn affidavit and the handwritten receipt issued by Atty. Caayon, than to Atty. Caayon's unsworn comment and self-serving certifications.
*   **Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the OCA's finding. It found Atty. Caayon guilty of Simple Misconduct.

**Obligations:**

*   Clerks of Court are prohibited from demanding and/or receiving commissioner's fees for ex-parte reception of evidence. (Manual for Clerks of Court, Section B, Chapter II)

**Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Caayon is found liable for Simple Misconduct.
*   The penalty imposed is suspension from service for one (1) month and one (1) day without pay.
*   A warning is issued that repetition of similar offenses will be dealt with more severely.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Manual for Clerks of Court (Section B, Chapter II and Section D(7), Chapter IV):** Prohibits collection of commissioner's fees in ex-parte proceedings. Cited in the earlier case of *Nieva v. Alvarez-Edad*, A.M. No. P-01-1459, January 31, 2005, 450 SCRA 45, which the Court references as further support for its finding.
*   **Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (Section 52(B), Rule IV):** Specifies the penalty for Misconduct (suspension for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the first offense). Implemented by CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19, series of 1999.
*   **RTC Makati Movement Against Graft and Corruption v. Atty. Inocencio E. Dumlao, Acting Clerk of Court, A.M. No. P-93-800-A, August 9, 1995, 247 SCRA 108.** Court states Manual as "Bible for Clerks of Court"

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Weight of Evidence:** The Court clearly favors the complainant's affidavit and the handwritten receipt over the respondent's unsworn comment and the self-serving certifications. This highlights the importance of sworn statements.
*   **"Commissioner's and Stenographer's Fees":** The handwritten receipt is crucial evidence. Its wording ("commissioner's and stenographer's fees") directly contradicts the respondent's claim that the money was solely for stenographic services.
*   **Definition of "Ex-Parte Proceedings":** While not explicitly defined in the decision, the prohibition on commissioner's fees in "ex-parte proceedings" is a key aspect.
*   **Subjectiveness of "Good Faith":** Atty. Caayon's claim that he received the money in "good faith" is dismissed by the court. This illustrates the court's scrutiny of subjective claims, especially when contradicted by documentary evidence.
*   **Application of *Nieva v. Alvarez-Edad*:** By referencing this earlier case, the Court emphasizes the strict application of the Manual for Clerks of Court and the consequences for violating its provisions regarding unauthorized fees.
