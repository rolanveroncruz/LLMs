## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Comillo, Jr.* (G.R. No. 186538)

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Ausencio Comillo, Jr., Lutgardo Comillo, and Romulo Altar*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Third Division

**Issue:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's conviction of the accused-appellants for the crime of murder.

**Holding:** Affirmed the CA decision with modifications regarding damages.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Murder qualified by treachery (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code).
*   **Facts:** The accused, acting in conspiracy, attacked and killed Pedro Barbo. Evidence showed Ausencio restrained the victim, Romulo hit him with a ukulele, and Lutgardo stabbed him. The victim died from the stab wound.
*   **Defenses:**
    *   **Ausencio:** Alibi (rejected due to proximity to crime scene and weakness of evidence). *Cf.* *People v. Guevarra*, G.R. No. 182192.
    *   **Lutgardo:** Self-defense (rejected due to lack of unlawful aggression by the victim and unreasonable means employed). The court emphasized that unlawful aggression must be present and imminent. *Cf.* *Mahawan v. People*, G.R. No. 176609. Additionally, the court stated when aggression ceases, the right to defend ceases as well *People v. Annibong, 451 Phil. 117, 127 (2003)*
    *   **Romulo:** Defense of a stranger (rejected due to lack of unlawful aggression by the victim).
*   **Conspiracy:** Established by the concerted actions of the accused. *Cf.* *Acejas III v. People*, G.R. No. 156643.
*   **Treachery:** Found to be present, qualifying the crime as murder. Defined under Paragraph 16, Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code. The coordinated attack ensured the victim was unable to defend himself. *Cf.* *Velasco v. People*, G.R. No. 166479.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** Evident premeditation (not proven) and abuse of superior strength (absorbed by treachery) were not appreciated. *Cf.* *People v. Pirame*, 384 Phil. 286, 300 (2000).
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The accused-appellants tried to claim the following mitigating circumstances, but they were rejected by the court. They are, no intention to commit so grave a wrong as that committed, sufficient provocation on the part of the offended party, and having acted upon an impulse so powerful as naturally to have produced passion or obfuscation.

**Penalties & Damages:**

*   **Penalty:** *Reclusion Perpetua* for each accused.
*   **Civil Indemnity:** P50,000 (standard for murder cases).
*   **Moral Damages:** P50,000 (standard for murder cases).
*   **Exemplary Damages:** Increased to P30,000 (due to treachery; increased based on current jurisprudence. *People v. Gidoc*, G.R. No. 185162).
*   **Temperate Damages:** P25,000 (awarded in lieu of unproven actual damages). *Cf.* *People v. Oco*, 458 Phil. 815, 855 (2003).
*   **Loss of Earning Capacity:** Not awarded due to lack of documentary evidence and the victim's income exceeding the minimum wage. *People v. Mallari*, 452 Phil. 210, 225 (2003).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The case heavily relies on the credibility of the eyewitnesses. A challenge to the witnesses' character or potential bias may be warranted in a different context if new evidence arises.
*   **Application of Self-Defense/Defense of Stranger:** The unsuccessful arguments of self-defense and defense of a stranger highlight the stringent requirements of these justifications, particularly the need for *unlawful aggression*.
*   **Damages:** The award of temperate damages underscores the importance of properly documenting actual damages. Failure to do so limits recovery.
