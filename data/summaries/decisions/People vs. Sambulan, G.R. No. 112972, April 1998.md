## Case Summary: People vs. Sambulan, G.R. No. 112972

**Citation:** 352 Phil. 336 (G.R. No. 112972, April 24, 1998)

**Parties:** People of the Philippines v. Romeo Sambulan, Lucas Sambulan, and Alfredo Sambulan

**Facts:**
Romeo and Lucas Sambulan were charged with murder for the death of Antonio Roda. The prosecution's evidence showed that a prior altercation between the victim and the appellants' father preceded the killing. Witnesses testified that Romeo and Lucas attacked the victim with bolos. Romeo admitted to killing the victim, claiming self-defense. Lucas died during the pendency of the appeal.

**Issue:**
Whether the trial court erred in convicting Romeo Sambulan of murder; specifically, whether self-defense was proven and whether the killing was qualified by evident premeditation and treachery.

**Holding:**
The Supreme Court modified the trial court's decision. Lucas Sambulan's criminal liability was extinguished by death. Romeo Sambulan was found guilty of **homicide**, not murder.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Admission of Killing:** Romeo's admission placed the burden on him to prove self-defense by clear and convincing evidence.
*   **Self-Defense:** Self-defense requires unlawful aggression by the victim, reasonable means to repel the attack, and lack of sufficient provocation by the defender. The court found unlawful aggression lacking as the victim was already immobilized when Romeo continued the attack.
*   **Extinguishment of Criminal Liability:** Death of accused pending appeal extinguishes criminal liability and civil liability *ex delicto.*
*   **Qualifying Circumstances:** To qualify an act of murder, any aggravating circumstance must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   Initially, the trial court sentenced both accused to *reclusion perpetua* for murder.
*   Supreme Court found Romeo guilty of homicide, sentencing him to an indeterminate sentence of 8 years *prision mayor* to 14 years and 8 months of *reclusion temporal*. He was also ordered to indemnify the heirs of the victim.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Self-Defense Failure:** The defense failed to establish unlawful aggression, a *sine qua non* element for self-defense. The nature and number of wounds inflicted on the victim further undermined this claim. *Case Law: People vs. Sazon et al., G.R. No. 89684*
*   **Evident Premeditation & Treachery:** The Court correctly overturned the initial finding of evident premeditation and treachery. It was not alleged in the information. Moreover, evident premeditation requires proof of a plan to commit the crime, a manifest indication the culprit has clung to his determination, and sufficient time between the determination and execution allowing for reflection. Those could not be established. *Case Law: People vs. Layno, et al., G.R. No. 110833, Article 14 of the RPC*
*   **Vindication of Grave Offense:** Vindication could not be established due to time elapsed between altercation, rendering impulse to harm not immediate. *Case Law: People vs. Santos, G.R. Nos. 99259-60*
*   **Instrument Used:** The inconsistency between the type of injuries found on the victim and the instrument presented as the murder weapon casts doubt on Romeo's testimony.
*   **Voluntary Surrender (Mitigating):** Romeo benefited from a mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):**
    *   Article 11 (Self-Defense)
    *   Article 249 (Homicide)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court modified the lower court's decision, convicting Romeo Sambulan of homicide instead of murder and factoring in the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. The key takeaways are the failure to prove self-defense due to the lack of unlawful aggression and the importance of proving qualifying circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.
