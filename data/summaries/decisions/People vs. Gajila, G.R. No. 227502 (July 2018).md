**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Randy Gajila y Salazar*, G.R. No. 227502, July 23, 2018

**Summary:** This is an appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Randy Gajila y Salazar for the crime of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The CA decision is affirmed with modifications.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Appellant was charged with murder qualified by treachery, evident premeditation, and abuse of superior strength for the stabbing death of Gerry Alcantara.
*   **Defense:** Appellant claimed self-defense.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Rejected self-defense claim, found appellant guilty of murder qualified by treachery. Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered to pay damages.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC decision but modified the damages awarded. Upheld the finding of guilt and treachery.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the CA Decision with the modification to the award of exemplary damages, increasing it to P75,000.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Appellant Randy Gajila y Salazar is obligated to serve a sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Appellant is liable for the following damages to the heirs of the victim:
    *   P75,000.00 as civil indemnity
    *   P47,641.50 as actual damages
    *   P1,383,286.95 for loss of earning capacity
    *   P75,000.00 as moral damages
    *   P75,000.00 as exemplary damages
    *   Interest at 6% per annum on all damages from the finality of the decision until fully paid.

**Key Issues & Legal Reasoning:**

1.  **Self-Defense:** The Court reiterates that when self-defense is invoked, the burden of proof shifts to the accused to prove its elements (unlawful aggression, reasonable necessity, lack of sufficient provocation) by clear and convincing evidence. Cites *People v. Rubiso*, 447 Phil. 374 (2003); Art. 11(1) of the RPC; *People v. Nugas*, 677 Phil. 168 (2011). The Court held that the appellant failed to prove unlawful aggression on the part of the victim. Several factors contributed to this finding:
    *   Appellant's flight from the scene, considered a badge of guilt.
    *   The location and nature of the victim's wounds, indicating a determined effort to kill.
    *   Inconsistencies between the Appellant's account and the medico-legal evidence.
    *   Lack of physical evidence to corroborate the Appellant's story.
2.  **Treachery:**  The Court upheld the finding of treachery, emphasizing that the appellant's sudden attack from behind, while the victim was occupied, ensured the execution of the crime without risk to the appellant. Cites *People v. Alajay*, 456 Phil. 83 (2003).

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (Murder)
*   Article 11(1) of the Revised Penal Code (Self-Defense)

**Case Law:**

*   People v. Rubiso, 447 Phil. 374 (2003) (Burden of Proof for Self-Defense)
*   People v. Nugas, 677 Phil. 168 (2011) (Unlawful Aggression)
*   People v. Gumayao, 460 Phil. 735, 746 (2003) (Flight as Badge of Guilt)
*   People v. Alajay, 456 Phil. 83, 92 (2003) (Treachery)
*   People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806, 847-848 (2016) (Exemplary Damages)

*    People v. Adlawan, 425 Phil. 804, 816 (2002). (Number of working days in a year)

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The defense's reliance on self-defense was weak due to inconsistencies in the appellant's testimony and lack of corroborating evidence.
*   The court's reliance on "flight as a badge of guilt" could be challenged, depending on specific factual nuances, although in this case, it was combined with other incriminating evidence.
*   The calculation of the loss of earning capacity is standardized but can be subject to debate based on assumptions and evidence.
* The CA affirmed the RTC's decision despite evident premeditation, taking advantage of superior strength, and nighttime alleged in the Information were not proven beyond reasonable doubt.

**Overall Assessment:**

The conviction appears sound, supported by witness testimony, medico-legal evidence, and the appellant's inability to convincingly establish self-defense. The legal reasoning regarding treachery is also consistent with established jurisprudence. The financial implications for the appellant are significant due to the combination of imprisonment and substantial damage awards.
