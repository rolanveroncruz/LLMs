## Legal Document Summary: People v. Nu単ez (G.R. No. 177148)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming the Court of Appeals' decision, which in turn affirmed the RTC's conviction of Raul Nu単ez for violation of Section 16, Article III of R.A. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972), as amended by R.A. 7659, for possession of regulated drugs (shabu).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Violation:** Illegal possession of 233.93 grams of *shabu* (methamphetamine hydrochloride).
*   **Elements of the Crime:**
    *   Possession of a regulated drug.
    *   Lack of legal authorization for possession.
    *   Knowledge that the substance is a regulated drug.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua, accessory penalties, and a fine of Php 2,000,000, based on the quantity of *shabu* exceeding 200 grams (Section 20(3) of R.A. 6425 as amended).

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused (Raul Nu単ez):** To refrain from possessing or using regulated drugs without proper authorization.
*   **Law Enforcement:** To conduct searches and seizures in compliance with the Constitution and Rules of Court, including proper execution of search warrants and protection of rights of the accused.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Criminal liability for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act, resulting in imprisonment and monetary fine.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Search Warrant:** The appellant questioned the generality of the address specified in the search warrant. While the Court ultimately ruled the issue was waived due to lack of timely objection, the Court emphasized that only items specifically stated in the warrant can be seized and the warrant cannot be used as a 'fishing expedition.'
*   **Illegal Seizure:** The Court acknowledged that the police officers improperly seized items not specifically listed in the search warrant (lady's wallet, cash, tools). These items were ordered to be returned to the appellant. This highlights the risk of exceeding the scope of a search warrant and potentially violating the right against unreasonable searches and seizures (Section 3, Rule 126, Rules of Court).
*   **Chain of Custody:** While not explicitly argued in the summary, the case implicitly touches on the integrity of evidence. Defense claimed a "frame-up," (drug planting).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972), as amended by R.A. 7659:** Establishes the crime of illegal possession of regulated drugs and the corresponding penalties.
*   **Section 16, Article III, R.A. 6425:** Defines the offense and penalty for possession or use of regulated drugs.
*   **Section 20(3), R.A. 6425:** Details penalties based on quantity of drugs, crucial in determining *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Section 3, Rule 126, Rules of Court:**  Governs the scope and permissible objects of seizure under a search warrant.
*   **People v. Mateo (G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 7, 2004):** Case cited regarding the transfer of appeals in drug cases to the Court of Appeals.
*   **People v. Torres (G.R. No. 170837, September 12, 2006):**  Defines the elements of illegal possession of regulated drugs.
*   **People v. Cabugatan (G.R. No. 172019, February 12, 2007):** Affirms that "frame-up" is a weak defense in drug cases.
*   **Dimacuha v. People (G.R. No. 143705, February 23, 2007):**  Reinforces the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty by law enforcement.
*   **Principle of Ejusdem Generis** used in interpreting the scope of "paraphernalia".

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Paraphernalia":** The court clarified that the general term must be interpreted in context.
*   **Waiver of Objection:** The Court deemed that the defense waived their challenge on the search warrant, but the underlying validity of the search warrant is still a potential point of contention and opens the possibility of errors in obtaining evidence.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Raul Nu単ez for illegal possession of *shabu*.  While the defense of frame-up was rejected due to lack of compelling evidence, the Court recognized an irregularity in the search related to the seizure of items not specified in the warrant and ordered their return. The decision highlights the importance of meticulously adhering to the procedural requirements of search warrants and the legal implications of an overly broad interpretation of "paraphernalia" during a search. The case emphasizes the risk of exceeding the scope of search warrants and the importance of adhering to the plain view doctrine.
