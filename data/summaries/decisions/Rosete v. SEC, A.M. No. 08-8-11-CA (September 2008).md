**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 08-8-11-CA (Re: Letter of Presiding Justice Conrado M. Vasquez, Jr. on CA-G.R. SP No. 103692 [Antonio Rosete, et al. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, et al.])**

**Nature:** Administrative matter regarding alleged improprieties by Justices of the Court of Appeals (CA) in relation to CA-G.R. SP No. 103692, a case involving MERALCO and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)/Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).  The document details an investigation into potential bribery, violations of the Internal Rules of the CA (IRCA), and breaches of judicial ethics.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **IRCA Interpretation Dispute:** Conflicting interpretations of Sections 1, 2(d), and 5 of Rule VI of the IRCA regarding which division (Justice Reyes' 8th Division or Justice Sabio's former Special 9th Division) should handle the Meralco case after Justice Reyes returned from leave.  Specifically, the dispute centered on whether the issuance of a TRO required the case to remain with the Justices who participated in its issuance (Justice Sabio, Justice Roxas, Justice Dimaranan-Vidal), even after Justice Reyes returned.  The Presiding Justice's authority to resolve this internal conflict is also questioned.
*   **TRO and Preliminary Injunction:** The distinction between a TRO and preliminary injunction is significant. The IRCA rules regarding participation of Justices vary based on whether a TRO or a preliminary injunction was granted. The resolution of the cases pending motion to lift the TRO became a key determinant on the issue.
*   **Bribery Allegation:** Justice Sabio alleges that Mr. Francis de Borja offered him P10 million on behalf of Meralco to step aside in favor of Justice Reyes. De Borja denies the bribery and claims Sabio solicited P50 million. This is tied to the chairmanship dispute.
*   **Motion to Inhibit Justice Roxas** : The failure to act on a motion to inhibit Justice Roxas.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judicial Ethics:** The Justices have a duty to adhere to the strictest code of ethics and highest standards of propriety.  This includes maintaining independence, impartiality, competence, and propriety.
*   **Adherence to IRCA:** Justices must follow the IRCA's procedures for case assignment, deliberation, and decision-making. Violation may result in administrative sanctions.
*   **Duty to Resolve Motions:** Judges must dispose of court business promptly and decide cases within the required periods. (See Code of Judicial Conduct)

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguous IRCA Rules:** The differing interpretations of the IRCA highlight ambiguities in the rules regarding division assignments and participation after a Justice returns from leave or after reorganization.
*   **Conflicting Testimony:** The conflicting accounts between Justice Sabio and De Borja create uncertainty about the bribery allegations.
*   **Leak of Confidential Information:** The disclosure of Justice Dimaranan-Vidal's letter to the media raises concerns about breaches of confidentiality within the CA.
