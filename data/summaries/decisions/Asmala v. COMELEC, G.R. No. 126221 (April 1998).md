## Legal Document Summary: Asmala v. COMELEC & Mohammad (G.R. No. 126221, April 28, 1998)

**Nature:** Special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65, seeking to annul the COMELEC Resolution setting aside the RTC order for execution pending appeal in an election protest case.

**Key Issue:** Whether COMELEC exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the RTC's order granting execution pending appeal in favor of Asmala, who was initially declared losing vice-mayor of Tuburan, Basilan, but won through an election protest.

**Facts:**

*   May 1995 Elections: Mohammad initially proclaimed Vice Mayor.
*   Election Protest (RTC): Asmala filed protest (4-95); Alano filed a separate protest which was then consolidated in 4-95. The RTC ruled in favor of Asmala, declaring him the duly elected Vice Mayor.
*   Mohammad's Appeal: Mohammad filed a Notice of Appeal with the RTC.
*   Asmala's Motion for Execution Pending Appeal: Filed with the RTC.
*   RTC Order: Granted Asmala's motion, requiring a bond.
*   Mohammad's Certiorari to COMELEC: Challenged RTC's jurisdiction, arguing appeal perfection divested RTC of power.
*   COMELEC Resolution: Granted Mohammad's petition, setting aside RTC order.
*   Supreme Court Petition: Asmala filed a certiorari petition.
*   COMELEC Execution Order: Before this court made any judgement, COMELEC then issues its own execution order.
*   Asmala's Supplemental Petition: Asks the court to issue a TRO.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court & Comelec Rules of Procedure:** Provide the framework for certiorari and election protest appeals.
*   **Motion for Execution Pending Appeal:** Asmala had the right to appeal the decision, but the court had to decide whether or not the execution could take place first.
*   **Posting of Bond:** Required of Asmala upon granting of execution pending appeal by RTC.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Invalidation of Votes:** The RTC invalidated ballots written by a limited number of people (1 or 2 hands).
*   **Contested Victory:** If the COMELEC decision stands, Mohammad remains Vice Mayor.
*   **Jurisdictional Error:** The crux of the issue is whether the RTC had jurisdiction to grant execution pending appeal after Mohammad filed his Notice of Appeal.
*   **Execution of Conflicting Orders:** The court's determination will lead to either Asmala or Mohammad becoming the defacto Vice Mayor.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Edding vs. COMELEC, 246 SCRA 502:** Key precedent stating the mere filing of a notice of appeal does not divest the trial court of jurisdiction over pending incidents, especially if the motion for execution pending appeal was filed before the perfection of the appeal.
*   **Relampagos vs. Cumba, 243 SCRA 690:** Any motion for execution pending appeal must be filed before the period for the perfection of the appeal. Upon perfection of the appeal, the trial court was divested of its jurisdiction over the case.
*   **Garcia vs. de Jesus and Tobon Uy vs. Comelec, 206 SCRA 779 and Veloria vs Comelec, 211 SCRA 907.** Was overturned by Relampagos
*   **Valencia vs. Court of Appeals, 184 SCRA 561.** An appeal is perfected upon the expiration of the last day to appeal by any party.
*   **Rule 35, Section 22 of the 1993 Comelec Rules of Procedure:** Sets the 5-day period to interpose an appeal.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Perfection of Appeal:** The timing of when the appeal is *perfected* is crucial. Mohammad argued perfection occurred upon filing his Notice of Appeal, divesting the RTC of jurisdiction immediately. Asmala argued appeal is not perfected until the lapse of the last day for any party to appeal.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court sided with Asmala, finding that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion. The RTC still had jurisdiction when Asmala filed his Motion for Execution Pending Appeal because the period to appeal had not yet expired for all parties, so jurisdiction was with the RTC.

**Implications:**

*   Reinstates the RTC's order of execution pending appeal, potentially installing Asmala as Vice Mayor.
*   Reaffirms the principle that filing a Notice of Appeal doesn't immediately divest the trial court of jurisdiction for pending incidents if filed prior to perfection of appeal.
*   Emphasizes the importance of timelines in election protest procedures.

**Potential Next Steps:**

*   Given that the decision is "immediately executory," implementation of the RTC order should proceed, subject to any further extraordinary remedies sought by Mohammad.
*   Verify if Mohammad has attempted any further recourse (e.g., Motion for Reconsideration, etc.).
