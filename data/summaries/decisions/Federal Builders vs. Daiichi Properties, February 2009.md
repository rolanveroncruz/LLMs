**Case Summary: Federal Builders, Inc. vs. Daiichi Properties and Development, Inc. (G.R. No. 142525, February 13, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 65 â€“ *procedurally incorrect, should be Rule 45*). Dispute arising from a construction agreement with subsequent revisions to the project plans, specifically concerning the method of calculating deductive costs.

**Parties:**
*   Petitioner: Federal Builders, Inc. (Contractor)
*   Respondent: Daiichi Properties and Development, Inc. (Owner)

**Key Provisions of Construction Agreement:**
*   Federal to provide labor and materials (excluding cement and steel bars).
*   Daiichi to provide cement (834,273 bags max) and steel bars (9,262,334.45 kg max).
*   Fixed labor and materials price of P212,000,000.00.
*   Daiichi's right to revise construction plans (Clause 2.10 & 8.01, 8.04 explicitly allows changes).
*   Obligation for contractor to undertake any additional work or extra work.

**Dispute:**
The core issue is the correct formula for calculating the deductive cost resulting from Daiichi's reduction in concrete strength (8,000 to 6,000 psi) and consequent revisions to the construction plans. The parties disagreed on whether to compare the original plan material requirements vs the revised plan (Daiichi's proposed method) or comparing the contracted maximums to the revised plans requirement (Federal's method).

**Key Arguments & Findings:**

*   **Daiichi's Position:** Deductive cost is the difference between materials required under the *original* plan and the *revised* plan. Argued the original plan materials required needed an expert quantification for comparison purposes.
*   **Federal's Position:** Deductive cost is the difference between the *guaranteed maximums* in the Construction Agreement and the *revised* plan requirements.
*   **CIAC Arbitral Tribunal:** Denied Daiichi's Motion to Commission an Independent Quantity Surveyor to assess materials needed under the original, unimplemented plan. Reasoned that such commissioning was not absolutely necessary and required mutual agreement.
*   **Court of Appeals:** Reversed the CIAC, ordering it to commission an independent quantity surveyor. Found the CIAC acted with grave abuse of discretion (in this case; capriciously, whimsically, arbitrarily), effectively preventing Daiichi from presenting evidence critical to its calculation of deductive costs and ignoring spirit of construction arbitration rules by not pursuing all reasonable fact-finding measures.
*   **Supreme Court:** Affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision.

**Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Incorrect Remedy:** SC noted the petition was filed under Rule 65 (Certiorari) when it should have been Rule 45 (Petition for Review), but addressed the merits anyway.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** SC concurred with CA that the CIAC's denial was grave abuse of discretion.  The CIAC should have used all reasonable means to ascertain facts, especially regarding the original plan materials required in the construction agreement that Federal held as proprietary and prevented Daiichi from quantifying. SC explicitly cited Article 1, Section 3 of the Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration, which states that arbitrators must "use every and all reasonable means to ascertain facts in each case speedily and objectively and without regard to technicalities of law or procedure."
*   **Expert Testimony:** Emphasized the technical nature of the dispute requiring expert input.
*   **Non-Binding Precedent:** CA did not pre-empt CIAC decision by alluding to a superior formula in Daiichi's method; that still remains for the CIAC to decide following the expert surveyor's report.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Deductive Cost Calculation:** The contract lacks a clear, defined methodology for calculating deductive costs arising from plan revisions. This ambiguity is the core of the dispute.
*   **Open to Interpretation Right to Revise Plans:** Clauses 2.10, 8.01 and 8.04 grant Daiichi broad rights to revise plans. While these clauses exist, the absence of a clear methodology to manage costs associated with changes creates opportunity for disputes.
*   **Fixed Price vs. Variable Scope:** Tension between the "fixed price" for labor/materials supplied by Federal (P212M) and Daiichi's right to alter plans. The absence of clearly-delineated mechanisms to account for material savings or cost-overruns associated with the changes presents a risk.
*   **Quantification of Original Plans:** Difficulty in accurately determining materials required under the original plan, especially as it was not implemented. This introduces an element of estimation and potential disagreement.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 vs. Rule 45, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Delineates proper appellate procedure.
*   **Article 1, Section 3, Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration:** Mandates arbitrators to actively seek facts without being bound by technicalities.
*   **Section 5, Chapter XV Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration:** Supports the designation of an independent quantity surveyor unilaterally (not requiring mutual agreement).

**Obligations:**

*   **CIAC:** Obligated to commission an independent quantity surveyor to assess the quantities of materials required under the original and revised plans. Furthermore, to resolve the case taking that information into account and to be bound by facts not procedure.
*   **Federal:** Required to participate in the arbitration process and provide any information relevant to the independent surveyor's assessment.

**Liability:**

*   The liability determination rests on the proper calculation of the deductive costs, which is to be decided by the CIAC after receiving the independent survey.  Potential liability lies with either party depending on the final determination of the deductive costs and the terms of the Construction Agreement.
