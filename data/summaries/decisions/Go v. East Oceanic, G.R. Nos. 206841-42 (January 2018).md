**Legal Document Summary: *Armando Go v. East Oceanic Leasing and Finance Corporation***

**Citation:** G.R. Nos. 206841-42, January 19, 2018 (824 Phil. 1)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the RTC Decision and Order in a consolidated collection case (Civil Case No. CEB-18366) and damages case (Civil Case No. CEB-21918).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Loan Agreement:** Armando Go (Go) obtained a loan of P14,062,888.00 from East Oceanic Leasing and Finance Corporation (East Oceanic) on March 22, 1995, evidenced by a Promissory Note.
*   **Purpose of Loan:** Loan was ostensibly for upgrading Go's bus fleet (Oriental Bus Lines). However, East Oceanic later alleged in the damages case that its Managing Director, Theodore Sy (Sy), misrepresented the true purpose as paying off an existing loan.
*   **Dishonored Checks:** Go issued six post-dated checks that were dishonored due to "Account Under Garnished."
*   **Collection Case (CEB-18366):** East Oceanic filed a collection suit against Go for P2,814,054.84 outstanding balance. Go argued the Promissory Note was void for non-compliance with BSP requirements, potentially implicating *Usury Law*.
*   **Damages Case (CEB-21918):** East Oceanic filed suit against Sy for damages based on his alleged false report regarding Go's loan purpose and financial status.
*   **Consolidation:** Cases were consolidated.
*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC ruled in favor of East Oceanic, ordering Sy to pay damages (P3,000,000.00 actual, attorney's fees, litigation expenses) and Go to pay the outstanding balance of P2,814,054.84 plus interest.
*   **Appeal:** Go appealed, arguing the RTC decision lacked factual and legal basis regarding his liability.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Go's Obligation:** Repay the loan amount as stipulated in the Promissory Note. RTC found him liable to pay the P2,814,054.84 outstanding balance plus interest, although this finding was subsequently reversed and remanded by the Supreme Court.
*   **Sy's Liability:** Found liable for damages to East Oceanic due to dishonesty and bad faith in performing his duties as managing director, based on his misrepresentation of the purpose of the loan.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Promissory Note:** Go's claim that the Promissory Note is void due to non-compliance with BSP requirements raises potential issues under the *Usury Law* and other banking regulations. The RTC must address this argument on remand.
*   **Lack of Factual/Legal Basis:** The Supreme Court found that the RTC's decision lacked a clear and distinct statement of the facts and law supporting its conclusion regarding Go's liability. The RTC's failure to resolve all issues in the collection case, particularly the amount of Go's liability, prejudiced Go's right to due process as per *Yao v. Court of Appeals* (398 Phil. 86 (2000)).
*   **Remand for Further Proceedings:** The case has been remanded to the RTC, meaning further litigation and potential factual disputes are expected. The RTC is obligated to resolve all issues brought up in the Collection Case in compliance with Article VIII, Section 14 of the Constitution.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article VIII, Section 14, Constitution:** Requires courts to clearly and distinctly state the facts and law on which decisions are based.
*   **Rule 36, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Mirrors the constitutional requirement.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 1 (January 28, 1988):** Requires judges to make complete findings of facts and scrutinize legal aspects.
*   **Yao v. Court of Appeals (398 Phil. 86 (2000)):** Emphasizes the importance of informing parties of the factual and legal reasons for the court's conclusions.
*   **Rule 45, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari, limiting jurisdiction to questions of law.
*   **Potential references to *Usury Law* and BSP regulations might be necessary if arguments surrounding the validity of the promissory note are raised.**

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed and set aside the RTC decision regarding the collection case (CEB-18366) due to the lack of a proper factual and legal basis. The case has been remanded for further proceedings. The primary legal risk involves the validity of the Promissory Note and determining the precise amount of Go's outstanding liability. The issue surrounding the original, misrepresented purpose of the loan, and the alleged bad faith of East Oceanic's managing director, may inform the analysis of liability and damages on remand.
