## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Guieb*, G.R. No. 233100 (Feb. 14, 2018)

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals' decision, acquitting Cristhian Kevin Guieb of violating Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession) of Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002). The Court found the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody due to unjustified deviations from Section 21 of RA 9165.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 9165, Sections 5 & 11:** Defines and penalizes illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs. The prosecution bears the burden of proving the identity of the buyer, seller, object, and consideration in cases of illegal sale, as well as proving the unauthorized, conscious, and free possession of the drug in cases of illegal possession.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21:** Outlines the procedure for handling seized drugs to preserve their integrity and evidentiary value. Requires immediate inventory and photography in the presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), a representative from the media, a representative from the DOJ, and an elected public official (all signing the inventory). The seized drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within 24 hours. **Crucially, this case emphasizes the *mandatory* nature of these requirements for upholding the integrity of the evidence.**
*   **IRR of RA 9165 (Sec 21(a)):** Allows inventory and photography at the nearest police station in warrantless seizure cases. Permits non-compliance with Sec. 21 if there are justifiable grounds, *provided* the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved. **However, as the Court reiterated in *People v. Almorfe* and *People v. De Guzman*, the prosecution must prove the justifiable grounds as a matter of fact; they cannot be presumed.**

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Compromised Chain of Custody:** Failure to strictly adhere to Section 21 raises doubts about the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs, potentially leading to acquittal, as happened in this case.
*   **Prosecutorial Duty:** The prosecution bears the affirmative duty to demonstrate *complete compliance* with Section 21 and to provide clear, convincing, and admissible evidence demonstrating why it was not possible. The Court is willing to examine the record completely to ensure there was compliance, even if the issues were not raised in the lower courts.
*   **Evidentiary Exclusion:** The prosecution's failure to demonstrate justification for non-compliance with Section 21 may result in the exclusion of the seized drugs as evidence, as the Court deems non-compliance to have "militated against a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt."

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***People v. Mendoza*, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Stressed the importance of media and DOJ representatives to prevent evidence switching or planting.
*   ***People v. Almorfe*, 631 Phil. 51 (2010):** Held that the prosecution must explain the reasons behind procedural lapses and demonstrate the integrity and evidentiary value of seized evidence were preserved for the "saving clause" to apply.
*   ***People v. De Guzman*, 630 Phil. 637 (2010):** Emphasized that justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21 must be *proven as fact*, not presumed.
*   ***People v. Sumili,***
*   ***People v. Macapundag,***

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Justifiable Grounds":** The meaning of "justifiable grounds" for non-compliance is not exhaustively defined in RA 9165 or its IRR. It remains a fact-specific determination for the courts. This case underscores that the prosecution *must* offer a plausible explanation for the absence of the required witnesses.
*   **Brgy. Capt. Refusal to Sign:** The Barangay Captain's refusal to sign the inventory because he did not witness the arrest highlights a potential ambiguity in the requirement. The law does not explicitly require the witness to observe the actual arrest, but the spirit of the law indicates they must be present during inventory and photography.

**Conclusion:**

This case emphasizes the strict procedural requirements for drug cases under RA 9165, particularly concerning chain of custody. The Court's decision underscores the significant risks associated with non-compliance and the affirmative duty of prosecutors to justify deviations from the prescribed procedure. Failure to meet these requirements can lead to acquittal, even if the accused arguably committed the crime. It provides guidance in that the Court will ensure compliance with the statute.
