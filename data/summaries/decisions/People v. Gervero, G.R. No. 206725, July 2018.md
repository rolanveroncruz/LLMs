**Case:** *People v. Gervero, et al.* G.R. No. 206725 (July 11, 2018)

**Summary:**

This is a case involving the conviction of Esmael Gervero (deceased), Danilo Castigador, Celso Solomon, and Eduardo Ba√±es for three counts of murder under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The accused, members of the Citizens Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU), were found guilty of fatally shooting Hernando Villegas, Jose Villegas, and Benito Basug, Jr. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision which upheld the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction, but with modifications to the damages awarded.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Multiple Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).
*   **Facts:** The accused, CAFGU members, shot and killed three CVO members (Hernando, Jose, and Benito) claiming they mistook them for members of the New People's Army (NPA). The incident occurred in Barangay Milan, Lemery, Iloilo.
*   **Defense:** The accused asserted "mistake of fact" (they believed the victims were NPA members during a tactical patrol) and fulfillment of duty.
*   **Prosecution:** Presented witnesses who testified that the accused knowingly and deliberately targeted the victims, and that the accused had an encounter with the victims a few hours prior.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of Murder.  Rejected the defenses of mistake of fact and fulfillment of duty.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed conviction, modified damages.  Found the accused's negligence in failing to verify the identities of the victims negated the mistake of fact defense. The sheer number of gunshot wounds demonstrated mens rea.
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed CA with modifications on damages based on *People v. Jugueta*, 783 Phil. 806 (2016).

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Civil Liability:** Ordered to pay the heirs of each victim:
    *   P75,000.00 as civil indemnity
    *   P75,000.00 as moral damages
    *   P75,000.00 as exemplary damages
    *   P50,000.00 as temperate damages
    *   Interest at 6% per annum from the date of finality until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Mistake of Fact:** The primary contentious issue was the application of "mistake of fact" as a defense.  The court extensively cited *People v. Oanis*, 74 Phil. 257 (1943) and *Yapyuco v. Sandiganbayan*, 689 Phil. 75 (2012) clarifying that mistake of fact is only a valid defense if the mistake is made *without* fault or carelessness. The court's finding that the accused were negligent in failing to verify the victims' identities, especially considering prior interactions, negated this defense.
*   **Treachery:** The court found that the sudden attack without warning, coupled with the accused positioning themselves in an ambush position and using high-powered firearms, constituted treachery, qualifying the killing as murder. The victims had no chance to defend themselves. *People v. Manzano, Jr.* G.R. No. 217974, 5 March 2018 was cited for treachery.
*   **Fulfillment of Duty:**  The defense of fulfillment of duty failed because the accused exceeded their authority and acted with excessive violence. *People v. Oanis* was also cited for this. Even if they were authorized to capture NPA members, their actions were not a "necessary consequence" of that duty.
*   **Damages:** Note the specific monetary awards based on *People v. Jugueta*.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 248 (Murder)
*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 14, par. 16 (Treachery)
*   *People v. Jugueta*, 783 Phil. 806 (2016) (Damages)
*   *People v. Oanis*, 74 Phil. 257 (1943) (Mistake of Fact, Fulfillment of Duty)
*   *Yapyuco v. Sandiganbayan*, 689 Phil. 75 (2012) (Mistake of Fact)
*   *People v. Manzano, Jr.* G.R. No. 217974, 5 March 2018 (Treachery)

**Legal Precision & Ambiguity:**

The language is generally precise, reflecting established principles of criminal law.  No obvious ambiguities exist. The court's application of the "mistake of fact" doctrine is crucial. The case hinges on the Court's assessment of the accused's actions as negligent and deliberate, rather than a genuine, reasonable mistake.
