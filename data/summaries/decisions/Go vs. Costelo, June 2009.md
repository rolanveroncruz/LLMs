## Legal Document Summary: *Aurora B. Go v. Margarito A. Costelo, Jr.* A.M. NO. P-08-2450

**Core Issue:** Administrative Complaint against Sheriff Margarito A. Costelo, Jr. for Grave Misconduct, Falsification, and Abuse of Authority related to the execution of a writ in an ejectment case.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Complainant:** Aurora B. Go, judgment debtor in an ejectment case (Civil Case No. R-36953).
*   **Respondent:** Margarito A. Costelo, Jr., Sheriff IV, RTC Branch 11, Calubian, Leyte.
*   **Alleged Misconduct:**
    *   Unauthorized conduct of auction sale: Sheriff allegedly conducted an auction sale without proper authority from the issuing court (MTCC, Cebu City).
    *   Falsification of Certificate of Sale: Allegedly falsified the Certificate of Sale, including notary details and date. Notary Public recanted then retracted his recantation, creating credibility issues.
    *   Improper Notice: Defective or non-existent notice of the auction sale.
    *   Auction Sale During Typhoon: Alleged conduct of the auction sale during a typhoon (November 8, 2001), making physical attendance impossible. Cebu PAGASA and Philippine Coast Guard certifications supported claims that it was impossible to travel to Calubian from Cebu on the stated date.
    *   Conflict of interest with approving officer of the Certificate of Sale.
    *   Fabricating court records, i.e. logbook of attendance, by falsifying the signatures of the alleged person in the purportedly received copy of the notice, but such person was unknown to complainant and Conde
    *   Persistence in conducting the auction sale with patent partiality in favor of Doris Sunbanon, the prevailing party in the ejectment case

*   **Respondent's Defense:** Denied irregularities, claimed valid levy and notice, and stated he was unaware of the property transfer to Anita Conde.

**Findings & Liabilities:**

*   **Investigating Judge's Findings:** Found Respondent guilty of unauthorized conduct of auction sale, and determined that the Certificate of Sale and Minutes of Auction Sale were fictitious, fabricated and spurious documents.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** Affirmed the Investigating Judge's findings and recommended dismissal. The OCA found the belatedly presented affidavits and evidence unpersuasive. It also found the recantation of Roberto Dela Pe単a as deserving of little credit.
*   **Court Decision:** Upheld the findings of Grave Misconduct, Grave Abuse of Authority, and Falsification of Official Document. Dismissal from service was ordered, forfeiture of benefits, and disqualification from re-employment.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 39, Sections 6 and 15:** Pertains to the execution of judgments, notice of sale, and proper procedures for auction sales of property. Notably Section 15 covers the procedure of written notice being given to the judgement obligor prior to the sale.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 13 Section 6** Pertaining to Personal Service.
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Rule IV, Section 52-A(3) & (6):** Grave Misconduct and Falsification of Official Document are grounds for dismissal.
*   **Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, Canon IV:** Sets standards for court personnel regarding diligence, truthfulness, and adherence to court orders.
*   *People vs. Rojo* 114 SCRA 304, the Court has invariably regarded affidavits of recantation as highly unreliable
*   *Malabanan v. Metrillo* A.M. No. P-04-1875, February 6, 2008, 544 SCRA 1, 7. Defines misconduct as a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, unlawful behavior; willful in character, improper or wrong behavior, while "gross" has been defined as "out of all measure beyond allowance; flagrant; shameful; such conduct as is not to be excused."
*   *Vilar v. Angel*, A.M. P-06-2276, February 5, 2007, 514 SCRA 147, 153, citing Civil Service Commission v. Cortez, 430 SCRA 593 (2004).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **Authority to Conduct Auction:** Lack of clear delegation of authority to the respondent sheriff to conduct the auction sale is the central contentious point. The Order authorized levy, not necessarily sale.
*   **Falsification Dispute:** The conflicting affidavits of the notary public (Dela Pe単a) raise questions of credibility.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Heavy reliance on circumstantial evidence (typhoon, lack of travel records) to prove the auction sale did not occur.
*   **Discretion of Investigating Judge:** Judge was both approving officer and subsequently investigator, which raised possible conflict of interest.
*   **Recanted testimony of Roberto dela Pe単a:** Inadmissible

**Risks:**

*   **Potential for Reversal:** The decision relies heavily on findings of fact which could be challenged on appeal or motion for reconsideration based on the credibility issues surrounding Dela Pe単a's affidavits and the weight given to circumstantial evidence.
