## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Laurel*, G.R. No. 120353

**Case Summary:**

This case involves the appeal of Flor N. Laurel from a conviction by the Regional Trial Court of Manila for illegal recruitment in large scale under Art. 38(b) in relation to Art. 39(a) of the Labor Code. Laurel promised overseas employment to four individuals (Ricardo San Felipe, Rosauro San Felipe, Juanito Cudal, and Cenen Tambongco, Jr.), collected fees, and then failed to deliver on her promises. It was verified that Laurel was not licensed or authorized to recruit by the POEA.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Art. 38(b) of the Labor Code:** Defines illegal recruitment committed by a syndicate or in large scale as an offense involving economic sabotage.
*   **Art. 39(a) of the Labor Code:** Prescribes the penalties for illegal recruitment in large scale: life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.00.
*   **Obligation:** Laurel had a legal obligation to either provide the promised overseas employment or return the fees collected.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Laurel was found guilty of illegal recruitment in large scale, leading to a sentence of life imprisonment and a fine.
*   **Civil Liability:** While the initial decision ordered restitution of unreturned fees, the Supreme Court reversed this aspect due to acknowledged full settlement by the complainants. However the payment by the accused does not expunge the crime already committed.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Large Scale" Recruitment:** Laurel's counsel argued that "large scale" requires a syndicate, not just individual action against three or more people. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, citing the clear language of the law.
*   **Affidavits of Desistance/Retractions:** The complainants provided affidavits of desistance and receipts acknowledging "full settlement." The lower court disregarded those affidavits as they were done after the prosecution rested its case. The Supreme Court affirmed the rejection of these affidavits, holding that they were given because of the return of money rather than from the accused's innocence, and did not create a reasonable doubt of her guilt.
*   **Full Settlement of Civil Liability:** While the Supreme Court deleted the requirement to pay the balance due to “full settlement” as indicated by the affidavits and receipts, this only addressed the civil liability and did not affect the criminal conviction.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Arts. 38(b) and 39(a):** These are the primary statutes under which Laurel was charged and convicted.
*   The Court relied on the principle that when statutory language is clear and unambiguous, courts must apply the law as written, citing *Basbacio v. Office of the Secretary, Department of Justice*, G.R. No. 109445, 7 November 1994, 238 SCRA 5, 10; *Libanan v. Sandiganbayan*, G.R. No. 112386, 14 June 1994, 233 SCRA 163, 167; *Victoria v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 109005, 10 January 1994, 229 SCRA 269, 273.
*   The court affirmed its previous rulings on individual liability for large-scale illegal recruitment, citing a list of cases including *People v. Melgar*, G.R. No. 118815, 18 August 1997.
*   The court applied the rule that affidavits of desistance/retraction should be viewed with disfavor unless there are special circumstances creating doubt of the accused's guilt and cited *People v. De Leon, G.R. No. 110558, 3 July 1995, 245 SCRA 538, 546*.

**Ambiguities and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main point of contention was the interpretation of "large scale" illegal recruitment. The defense attempted to link it directly to recruitment by a syndicate, which the court rejected. There appeared to be an argument that the 'full settlement' should have been considered and have more weight, however it was determined that the full settlement was acknowledgement of a debt paid, but does not negate the illegal act.
*   The ambiguities in the affidavits of desistance ("misunderstood the circumstances") were insufficient to overcome the victims' original testimonies.
