**Legal Document Summary: People v. Dela Cruz, G.R. No. 184792 (2009)**

**Case Overview:**

The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the conviction of Alfredo Dela Cruz (Didong) for murder, upholding the decisions of the Court of Appeals (CA) and Regional Trial Court (RTC). Dela Cruz was charged with murder under the Revised Penal Code for the death of Ahlladin Trinidad y Payumo.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** Dela Cruz was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, qualified by treachery.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Reliance was placed on the eyewitness testimony of Anthony Villacorta and corroborating testimony of Zenaida Soriano. The SC upheld the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, despite inconsistencies, noting Anthony's fear and subsequent additional statement (Karagdagang Salaysay) implicating Dela Cruz.
*   **Defense:** Dela Cruz's alibi and denial were rejected as insufficient to overcome the positive identification by the prosecution witness.
*   **Treachery:** The SC agreed with the lower courts' finding of treachery, emphasizing the victim's state of intoxication and the suddenness of the attack that deprived him of the opportunity to defend himself.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Dela Cruz is sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:** Dela Cruz is obligated to pay the heirs of the victim:
    *   Civil indemnity: PhP 75,000
    *   Moral damages: PhP 75,000
    *   Exemplary damages: PhP 30,000

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Witness Credibility:** The primary point of contention was the credibility of Anthony Villacorta, whose initial statement omitted Dela Cruz. The SC justified the change in statement due to fear, referencing an attempt on Villacorta's mother's life. This remains a potential area of scrutiny, focusing on the possible influence of fear and the "Karagdagang Salaysay."
*   **Alibi:** While the alibi was weak, the proximity of Dela Cruz's location to the crime scene suggests the possibility of questioning the prosecution's reconstruction of events.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The case relies heavily on the testimony of a single witness. The Karagdagang Salaysay was made after some time, which could raise questions on the accuracy of the memory or if the testimony was tainted by external factors.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Basis for the murder charge and penalties.
*   **Republic Act (RA) 7659:** Originally prescribed the death penalty for murder but was later amended by RA 9346.
*   **RA 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, reducing the penalty to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Case Law:**
    *   *People v. Malibiran, G.R. No. 178301, April 24, 2009:* Deference to trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
    *   *Lascano v. People, G.R. No. 166241, September 7, 2007, 532 SCRA 515:* Upholding credibility of witnesses.
    *   *Cruz v. People, G.R. No. 154502, April 27, 2007, 522 SCRA 391:* Incompleteness and inaccuracy of affidavits.
    *   *People v. Mara, G.R. No. 184050, May 8, 2009:* Definition of treachery.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The reliance on the "Karagdagang Salaysay" given the initial omission and alleged threat.
*   The level of influence in Villacorta's testimony given the attempt on Villacorta's mother's life.
