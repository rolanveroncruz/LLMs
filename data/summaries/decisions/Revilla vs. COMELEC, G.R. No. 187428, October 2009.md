**Legal Document Summary - *Revilla v. COMELEC & Lanoy* (G.R. No. 187428)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64, assailing COMELEC Second Division's denial of Petitioner Revilla's motion for reconsideration in an election protest.

**Facts:**

*   Revilla and Lanoy were candidates for Punong Barangay. Revilla was initially proclaimed winner based on the Barangay Board of Canvassers' count.
*   Lanoy filed an election protest in the MCTC, which ruled in his favor after revision.
*   Revilla filed a notice of appeal and paid the P1,000.00 appeal fee to the MCTC.
*   COMELEC Second Division initially dismissed the appeal for failure to pay the full appeal fee (P3,200 per COMELEC Resolution No. 8486).
*   Revilla paid the deficient appeal fee and filed a motion for reconsideration.
*   COMELEC Second Division denied the motion because of deficient payment of the motion fee, and later, the second motion for reconsideration.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Violation of COMELEC En Banc Requirement:** The core issue is the COMELEC Second Division's denial of Revilla's motion for reconsideration, which Petitioner alleges violates Article IX-C, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution and Rule 19, Sections 5 and 6 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure. These provisions mandate that motions for reconsideration of division decisions must be decided by the COMELEC *en banc*.
*   **Perfection of Appeal:** The COMELEC's dismissal of Revilla's appeal due to non-payment or insufficient payment of appeal fee *after* initial payment to the MCTC is challenged.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:**  The COMELEC's denial of the motion for reconsideration because of a discrepancy in the motion fee payment is another challenged point.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the Petition, finding that the COMELEC Second Division acted with grave abuse of discretion. The division's orders were **ANNULLED and SET ASIDE**, and the case was **REMANDED** to the COMELEC for disposition *en banc*.

**Reasoning/Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article IX-C, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution:**  Explicitly requires motions for reconsideration to be decided by the COMELEC *en banc*.
*   **Rule 19, Sections 5 and 6 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure:** Reinforce the requirement for *en banc* resolution of motions for reconsideration.
*   **A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC (Rules of Procedure in Election Contests Before the Courts Involving Elective Municipal and Barangay Officials):** Payment of initial appeal fee to the MCTC perfected the appeal.
*   **Rule 22, Section 9(a) and Rule 40, Section 18 of the COMELEC Rules:** Provides COMELEC with discretion to dismiss for non-payment of fees or defer action until fees are paid, but does not mandate automatic dismissal.
*   **Aguilar v. COMELEC (G.R. No. 185140, June 30, 2009):** Cited as analogous precedent.
*   **Olanolan v. Commission on Elections (G.R. No. 165491, March 31, 2005):**  Reiterates COMELEC *en banc*'s discretion regarding fee payment.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   COMELEC is obligated to resolve motions for reconsideration *en banc*.
*   COMELEC is bound by its own Rules of Procedure, and constitutional mandates.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The COMELEC's interpretation of its own rules regarding appeal fee payment appears inconsistent.
*   While the Court remanded for disposition, the resolution doesn't explicitly address what action COMELEC should take, only clarifying the impermissibility of dismissal due to late or insufficient payment of the appeal fee. This could lead to further litigation.
*   **Statutory Interpretation:** The ambiguity lies in whether the initial payment to MCTC and later attempt to pay the deficient fee with COMELEC constitutes enough diligence from the petitioner, weighing in favor of fairness.

**Recommendations:**

The COMELEC en banc is now obligated to rule on the merits of Revilla's appeal, with the understanding that dismissal based solely on the delayed payment of the additional appeal fee is prohibited. The case should be handled expeditiously given the time elapsed since the original election protest.
