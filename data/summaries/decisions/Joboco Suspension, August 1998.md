**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 93-10-1296-RTC**

**Nature:** Administrative case involving complaints and counter-complaints between Judge Bonifacio S. Maceda and Atty. Rogelio R. Joboco.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Atty. Joboco (Clerk of Court):** Found GUILTY of:
    *   **Infidelity in the Custody of Court Records:** Failure to properly manage and account for case records despite prior warnings (citing *Juntilla vs. Calleja, 262 SCRA 291; Bandong vs. Ching, 261 SCRA 10*).
    *   **Usurpation of Judicial Authority and Tampering Subpoena:** Improperly resetting a hearing date on an oral motion, exceeding his authority (citing *Re: Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the Regional Trial Court Branches 61, 134 and 147, Makati, Metro Manila, 248 SCRA 5*).
    *   **Grave Misconduct** associated with the above.
    *   **Falsification of Certificates of Service:** Omitting a half-day absence in his certificate, despite subsequent correction.
    *   **Misconduct:** Attempting to involve court employees in IBP matters.
    *   **Absence Without Official Leave (AWOL):** Numerous unapproved absences.
    *   **Penalty:** Fined P20,000.00.

*   **Judge Maceda:** Charges against him DISMISSED for lack of merit.

**Obligations:**

*   **Atty. Joboco:** As Clerk of Court, had a clear obligation to maintain accurate case records, adhere to proper procedures for scheduling hearings, and accurately report his attendance.
*   **Judge Maceda:** Duty to supervise court personnel and ensure efficient administration of justice.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Joboco:** Fined P20,000.00 for the proven administrative offenses.
*   **Judge Maceda:** While not held liable, was ADMONISHED for abuse of authority in refusing to sign Atty. Joboco's certificates of service.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Attendance Verification:** The detail of Atty. Joboco to a location outside the courthouse created a verifiable difficulty, yet Judge Maceda used this against him.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article VIII, Section 6:** Supreme Court's administrative supervision over courts, invoked by Joboco against first suspension.
*   **Administrative Order No. 6:** Purportedly allowed Judge Maceda to suspend Joboco (challenged by Joboco).
*   **Rule 3.10 of the Code of Judicial Conduct:** Judge's duty to initiate disciplinary measures (cited by Judge Maceda as justification for actions).
*   **Revised Administrative Code & Local Government Code of 1991 (R.A. No. 7160), Section 484, Par. 1 (XI):**  Judge Maceda invoked these to justify accepting support from the governor.
*   **Cited Cases:**
    *   *Juntilla vs. Calleja, 262 SCRA 291*
    *   *Bandong vs. Ching, 261 SCRA 10*
    *   *Re: Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the Regional Trial Court Branches 61, 134 and 147, Makati, Metro Manila, 248 SCRA 5*
    *   *Manlavi vs. Gacott, Jr., 244 SCRA 50*
    *   *Boquiren vs. Del Rosario-Cruz, 244 SCRA 702*
    *   *Guillermo vs. Reyes, Jr., 240 SCRA 154*

**Notes for Litigation/Advice:**

*   This case highlights the importance of clear lines of authority and responsibility within the court system.
*   Judge Maceda's actions, while not resulting in liability, were criticized, indicating potential grounds for appeal on due process grounds if the sanctions against Joboco were deemed excessive.
*   The ambiguity surrounding attendance verification and the Judge's role in creating that ambiguity could be grounds to challenge the AWOL findings.
*   The penalty against Joboco is a fine; his subsequent appointment as Assistant City Prosecutor arguably renders a suspension moot, but it does not remove the offense.
