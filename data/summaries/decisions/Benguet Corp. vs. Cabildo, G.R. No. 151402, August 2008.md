## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 151402 (Benguet Corporation v. Cabildo)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Case Summary:** Benguet Corporation (BC) appeals a CA decision affirming an RTC ruling that BC breached a Contract of Work with Cesar Cabildo for painting mill buildings and bunkhouses. BC claims the contract only covered exterior painting and that it properly contracted Rolando Velasco for interior painting.

**Key Provisions of the Contract of Work:**

*   **Scope of Work:**  "Shall paint the Mill Buildings at Balatoc Mill and all the bunkhouses at Balatoc, Itogon, Benguet, including certain repair works which may be necessary." No explicit differentiation between interior and exterior.
*   **Payment:**  Specific rates per square meter for various tasks (painting, scraping, scaffolding, etc.).
*   **Labor Obligations:** Cabildo responsible for his employees' wages, benefits, and compliance with labor laws.  BC can be reimbursed for any labor liability it assumes on Cabildo's behalf.
*   **Retention:** BC retains 10% of each payment until 30 days after final acceptance of the work, pending employee certifications of full payment.
*   **Subcontracting:**  Cabildo prohibited from assigning or subcontracting the work.
*   **Liability:**  Cabildo solely liable for damages arising from injury/death/property damage due to his or his employees' actions; requires Cabildo to reimburse BC for any such liability.
*   **Completion:** No specific completion deadline stipulated in the contract.
*   **Governing law**: Civil Code of the Philippines (specifically Art. 1370, 1371, 1377)

**Obligations of Benguet Corporation:**

*   Provide materials for the painting job.
*   Pay Cabildo according to the agreed-upon price schedule for completed work.
*   Allow Cabildo to complete the painting of the Mill Buildings and Bunkhouses.
*   Refrain from awarding a similar contract to another party (Velasco) covering the same scope of work.

**Obligations of Cesar Cabildo:**

*   Paint the Mill Buildings and Bunkhouses as specified in the contract.
*   Employ and pay his workers.
*   Obtain security clearances for his employees.
*   Complete the work within a reasonable timeframe (inferred, as no deadline is specified).
*   Be liable for damages from work related injuries

**Liabilities:**

*   **Benguet Corporation:** Found liable for breach of contract by awarding a contract to Velasco for interior painting of the Mill Buildings while Cabildo's contract was still in effect. Liable for actual damages, unrealized profit, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   **Cesar Cabildo:** Noted obligation to cover damage or injury due to work done by his workers.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Scope of Work:** The lack of explicit delineation between interior and exterior painting led to the dispute.  This highlights the risk of imprecise contract drafting.
*   **Indemnity Clause:** Paragraph (7) imposes broad indemnity obligations on Cabildo, potentially exposing him to significant liabilities arising from the acts of his employees.
*   **Lack of Completion Deadline:**  The missing completion date (Paragraph 8) introduces uncertainty and potential for disputes regarding timely performance. Though it does not specifically stipulate, the ruling court has found that not allowing Cabildo from preforming the contracted job is a violation of the contract.
*   **Interpretation against Drafter:** Art. 1377 of the Civil Code states that "the interpretation of obscure words or stipulations in a contract shall not favor the party who caused the obscurity". As Benguet Corporation solely drafted the contract, any ambiguity is interpreted against them.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code (Republic Act No. 386):** Specifically, Articles 1370 (Interpretation of contracts), 1371 (Judging intention of contracting parties), and 1377 (Interpretation against drafter).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Abad v. Goldloop Properties, Inc. (G.R. No. 168108, April 13, 2007):**  Cited for the principle of literal interpretation of contracts when terms are clear. Also, in the case of *Bautista v. Court of Appeals*, the rule of plainness is further discussed.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The scope of work description "paint the Mill Buildings and all the bunkhouses" is ambiguous. Is it implied that both inside and outside buildings are painted? The courts rule that ambiguity must be used against BC because it drafted the contract.

**Conclusion:**

Benguet Corporation breached the Contract of Work by awarding a similar contract to Velasco. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' findings due to the lack of clear distinction between interior and exterior work in Cabildo's contract, the actions of BC suggesting an intent to include interior work, and the principle of *contra proferentem* (interpreting ambiguity against the drafter). This case serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of clear and unambiguous contract drafting, particularly regarding the scope of work and clearly defining what falls under the obligations of the person contracted.
