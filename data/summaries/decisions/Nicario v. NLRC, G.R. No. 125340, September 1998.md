**Legal Document Summary: Nicario v. NLRC, Mancao Supermarket Inc.**

**Case:** *Emelita Nicario v. National Labor Relations Commission, Mancao Supermarket Inc., and/or Manager, Antonio Mancao* (G.R. No. 125340, September 17, 1998)

**Nature:** Special Civil Action for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing NLRC resolution denying overtime pay and holding Manager Mancao not jointly liable.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Employment & Termination:** Emelita Nicario was employed as a salesgirl/supervisor at Mancao Supermarket and was terminated on February 7, 1989.
*   **Initial Complaint:** Filed for illegal dismissal and various unpaid benefits including backwages, wage differential, service incentive leave pay, overtime pay, 13th month pay and unpaid wages.
*   **Procedural History:** Initial Labor Arbiter dismissal reversed by NLRC due to questions about payroll signatures and remanded for formal hearing. Second Labor Arbiter awarded unpaid benefits (excluding holiday premium pay and certain unpaid salaries). This award was affirmed by NLRC, then later modified on MR to remove overtime pay and Mancao's joint liability.
*   **Overtime Pay Dispute:** Petitioner claimed 12-hour workdays, entitling her to overtime. The NLRC, on reconsideration, rejected this based on submitted Daily Time Records (DTRs).
*   **Manager's Liability:** Petitioner sought to hold Manager Antonio Mancao jointly and severally liable with the corporation for the monetary award.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **Employer (Mancao Supermarket):** Obligation to pay overtime if employee worked beyond standard hours. Obligation to keep accurate records of employee hours.
*   **Employee (Emelita Nicario):** Obligation to provide proof of overtime work if challenged.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Mancao Supermarket:** Found liable for overtime pay (reversing NLRC's modified decision). Other unpaid benefits awards upheld.
*   **Antonio Mancao:** Not held personally liable.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliability of DTRs:** The central issue is the validity of the DTRs submitted by Mancao Supermarket. The Supreme Court finds these unreliable due to suspicious consistency and failure to produce original documents when forgery was alleged. Reference Sec. 3(e), Rule 131, Rules of Court. The original DTRs were not provided even when forgery was claimed by the petitioner.
*   **Judicial Notice:** The Labor Arbiter's use of judicial notice regarding store hours (Rule 129, Section 2 of the Rules of Court) was upheld, strengthening the claim for overtime. This proved useful in negating the company's submission.
*   **Solidary Liability of Corporate Officer:** The Court reiterates the general rule that corporate officers are *not* personally liable unless they acted with malice or bad faith in exceeding authority. This finding is consistent with *Pabalan vs. NLRC, 184 SCRA 495 (1990)*
*   **Burden of Proof:** Employer has the burden to disprove claim of non-payment of wages.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Basis for the special civil action.
*   **Rule 129, Section 2 of the Rules of Court:** Judicial Notice
*   **Rule 131, Section 3(e) of the Rules of Court:** Evidence wilfully suppressed
*   **Madlos v. NLRC, 254 SCRA 248 (1996):** Regarding the deference to NLRC's factual findings when supported by substantial evidence.
*   **Pantranco v. NLRC, 239 SCRA 272 (1994):** Emphasizing the need for review when Labor Arbiter and NLRC findings conflict.
*   **Eduardo Prangan v. NLRC, G.R. No. 126529, April 15, 1998:** Regarding the dubiousness of uniform DTR entries.
*   **Sarmiento v. Employees Compensation Commission, 144 SCRA 422 (1986):** On resolving doubts in favor of labor.
*   **Pabalan vs. NLRC, 184 SCRA 495 (1990):** Discussing the piercing of the corporate veil and the liability of corporate officers.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary ambiguity lies in determining the actual hours worked by the employee. The resolution hinges on the credibility of evidence presented by both parties.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court partially granted the petition, reinstating the award of overtime pay but absolving the manager of personal liability. The ruling emphasizes the importance of reliable timekeeping records and resolves doubts in favor of the employee when the employer's evidence is suspect.
