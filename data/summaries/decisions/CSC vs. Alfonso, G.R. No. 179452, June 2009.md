## Legal Document Summary: *Civil Service Commission vs. Larry M. Alfonso* (G.R. No. 179452)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the Civil Service Commission's (CSC) resolution to formally charge and preventively suspend Larry M. Alfonso, Director of the Human Resources Management Department of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP), for Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, based on alleged abuse of authority related to overnight work compensation.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charges:** Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service (stemming from alleged fraudulent claiming of overnight work compensation).
*   **Preventive Suspension:** CSC imposed a 90-day preventive suspension on Alfonso, reinstated by the Supreme Court.
*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** Central argument revolves around whether the CSC has jurisdiction over the administrative case, given Alfonso's claim that the PUP Board of Regents (BOR) has exclusive jurisdiction based on R.A. No. 8292 (Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997) in relation to R.A. No. 4670 (Magna Carta for Public School Teachers) and P.D. No. 1341 (PUP Charter).
*   **CSC Authority:** The Supreme Court affirms CSC's constitutional and statutory authority (Art. IX-B, Sec. 2(1) and Sec. 3 of the Constitution; P.D. 807, Sections 9(j) and 37(a)) as the central personnel agency with jurisdiction to supervise and discipline government employees, including those in government-owned or controlled corporations like PUP.

**Obligations:**

*   **Alfonso:** Obligated to answer the formal charges filed by the CSC and comply with the preventive suspension order.
*   **CSC:** Obligated to proceed with the administrative hearing against Alfonso with dispatch.
*   **PUP:** Obligated to implement the preventive suspension order.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Alfonso:** Potential liability for Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, carrying penalties ranging from suspension to dismissal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **For Alfonso:** Upholding the CSC jurisdiction could lead to disciplinary action, including suspension or dismissal. The Supreme Court emphasizes that the power granted to the Board of Regents is *in addition* to its general powers of administration, not exclusive.
*   **For PUP:** Failure to comply with the CSC's orders could result in contempt charges and administrative cases against PUP officials.
*   **Ambiguity:** No significant ambiguities identified in the summarization.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article IX-B, Sections 2(1) and 3:** Establishes the Civil Service Commission and its broad authority.
*   **P.D. 807 (Civil Service Law of 1975), Sections 9(j) and 37(a):** Grants the CSC the power to hear and decide administrative disciplinary cases.
*   **R.A. No. 8292 (Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997) in relation to R.A. No. 4670 (Magna Carta for Public School Teachers):** Argued by Respondent to support Board of Regents' exclusive disciplinary jurisdiction, but rejected by the Court.
*   **P.D. No. 1341 (PUP Charter):** Cited by CA and Respondent in arguing that the PUP Board of Regents has jurisdiction.
*   ***Office of the Ombudsman v. Masing, G.R. No. 165416:*** Reaffirms that R.A. 4670 does not confer exclusive disciplinary authority on the Department of Education.
*   ***Civil Service Commission v. Sojor, G.R. No. 168766:*** The Supreme Court upheld the CSC's jurisdiction over a case involving a state university president, holding that while the Board of Regents has administrative powers, it is not exclusive.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary point of contention lies in the interpretation of R.A. No. 8292 and R.A. No. 4670 concerning the extent of the PUP Board of Regents' disciplinary authority. The Supreme Court decisively interprets this authority as *concurrent* with the CSC's, not exclusive.

**Estoppel by Laches:**

* The Supreme Court notes that Alfonso submitted to the jurisdiction of the CSC. This is by filing his counter-affidavit and motion for reconsideration, and requesting a change of venue within the CSC system (not to the BOR). This constitutes estoppel by laches and prevents him from now questioning the CSC's jurisdiction.
