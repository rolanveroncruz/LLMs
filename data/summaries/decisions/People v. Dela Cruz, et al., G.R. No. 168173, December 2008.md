## Legal Document Summary: People v. Dela Cruz, G.R. No. 168173 (2008)

**Nature:** Automatic appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of appellants for Robbery with Homicide (Art. 294, RPC) and Robbery in Band (Art. 296, RPC).

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Robbery with Homicide (Crim. Case No. Q-99-85787):**
    *   **Elements Proven:** The Court finds that the elements of robbery with homicide were proven beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution established intent to rob the 7-Eleven Convenience Store, with the killings of Nestor Mayagma and Elmer Duque being incidental thereto (People v. Mendoza, G.R. No. 115809).
    *   **Conspiracy:** The Court affirmed a conspiracy among the appellants. The act of one conspirator is the act of all, making all principals in the robbery with homicide (People v. Punzalan, G.R. No. 78853).
    *   **Treachery:** The Court sustained the RTC's finding of treachery in Nestor's killing, as the attack was designed to eliminate resistance to the robbery (People v. Escote, Jr., G.R. No. 140756). However, treachery was *not* found in Elmer's killing.
    *   **Penalty Modified:** Death penalty reduced to *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole, pursuant to RA 9346 (People v. Jabiniao, G.R. No. 179499).

*   **Robbery in Band (Crim. Case No. Q-99-85788):**
    *   **Conviction Upheld, Charge Modified:** The Court affirmed conviction, however charges were modified to *simple robbery* (Art. 293 RPC) instead of *Robbery in Band*. Failure to specifically allege the robbery in band in the charging information means it cannot be recognized as an aggravating circumstance.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Restitution:** Appellants are jointly and severally liable to pay the heirs of Elmer Duque and Nestor Mayagma civil indemnity.
*   **Damages:** Appellants are liable for moral damages, exemplary damages, and actual damages.
*   **Restitution to establishments:** Appellants ordered to restitute the amounts stolen from 7-Eleven and Petron, which can be reviewed if these items can no longer be restituted.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Testimonial Evidence:** The case hinges heavily on witness testimony. Any challenges to the credibility of these witnesses could impact the outcome, though the court emphasized the trial court's ability to assess witness demeanor.
*   **Lack of Specific Intent (Elmer Duque):** While conspiracy is established, proving the intent to kill Elmer specifically remains a challenge.
*   **Civil Liability:** Joint and several liability means each appellant can be held liable for the entire judgment, regardless of their individual participation.
*   **Factual Disputes:** Inconsistencies in the appellants' alibi and denial were critical to their conviction. Any new evidence contradicting the prosecution's timeline could be grounds for appeal.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Articles 293 (Robbery), 294 (Robbery with Homicide), 296 (Robbery in Band), 63 & 64 (Application of Penalties).
*   **Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Rule 110 Section 8 (Designation of the offense).
*   **People v. Mendoza, G.R. No. 115809:** Elements of Robbery with Homicide.
*   **People v. Punzalan, G.R. No. 78853:** Conspiracy in criminal acts.
*   **People v. Escote, Jr., G.R. No. 140756:** Elements of Treachery.
*   **People v. Jabiniao, G.R. No. 179499:** RA 9346 abolishing the death penalty.
