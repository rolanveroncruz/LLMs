**Case Summary: People v. Balles, Sulit, and Libao (G.R. No. 226143)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of the accused for violation of Section 5 (illegal sale) and Section 11 (illegal possession) of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Illegal Sale (Sec. 5, RA 9165):** Accused were convicted of selling methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) in a buy-bust operation.
*   **Illegal Possession (Sec. 11, RA 9165):** Accused Fernando Balles was also convicted of possessing shabu.
*   **Chain of Custody (Sec. 21, RA 9165):** The central issue is whether the prosecution adequately established an unbroken chain of custody over the seized drugs.
*   **Procedural Safeguards (Sec. 21(a), Implementing Rules of RA 9165, prior to amendment by RA 10640):** Applicable law requires immediate physical inventory and photography of seized drugs after confiscation, in the presence of the accused or their representative, a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official.

**Obligations:**

*   The prosecution bears the burden of proving the corpus delicti of the crimes, specifically establishing the identity and integrity of the seized drugs beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   Apprehending officers have a duty to strictly comply with the procedural safeguards outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165 and its implementing rules. This includes the immediate marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized drugs.
*   The prosecution must account for the possession of the evidence from the time of seizure until presentation in court.

**Liabilities:**

*   The original trial court found the accused guilty of violations of RA 9165 and imposed sentences of life imprisonment and fines for illegal sale, and imprisonment and fines for illegal possession.
*   The Supreme Court overturned the lower courts' decisions, acquitting the accused due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and the accused's right to due process.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to Comply with Sec. 21 Requirements:** The buy-bust team failed to immediately mark the seized plastic sachets at the place of arrest or the nearest police station. The chain of custody became compromised at the initial point of the investigation.
*   **Insufficient Documentation:** No physical inventory or photographs were taken in the presence of the accused or required representatives.
*   **Unaccounted Custody:** Gaps in the chain of custody exist regarding the identities of those who handled the seized items after PO2 Jimenez and prior to P/Insp. Mariano, the forensic chemist.
*   **Loss of Integrity of Evidence:** Non-compliance with mandatory procedures undermines the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs, raising reasonable doubt about whether the drugs presented in court were the same drugs seized from the accused.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession).
*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 and its Implementing Rules (prior to RA 10640 amendment):** Mandates specific procedures for handling seized drugs.
*   *People v. Bartolini, 791 Phil. 626, 634 (2016):* Emphasizes the prosecution's duty to prove every link in the chain of custody.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "saving mechanism" in the last sentence of Section 21(a) of the IRR allows for non-compliance with the prescribed procedures under "justifiable grounds," provided that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved. This clause is contentious because its interpretation can lead to subjective assessments of what constitutes "justifiable grounds" and whether integrity was truly preserved. In this case, no justifiable grounds were recognized.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to the prosecution's failure to adhere to mandatory chain of custody requirements outlined in RA 9165 and related jurisprudence. The failure to immediately mark, inventory, and photograph the seized items, coupled with gaps in the chain of custody, created reasonable doubt regarding the integrity of the evidence, ultimately leading to the acquittal of the accused. The decision underscores the importance of strict compliance with procedural safeguards in drug cases.
