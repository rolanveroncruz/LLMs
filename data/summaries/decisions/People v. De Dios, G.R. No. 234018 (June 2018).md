**Case Summary: *People v. De Dios*, G.R. No. 234018 (June 6, 2018)**

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Evangeline De Dios for Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 3(a), in relation to Section 6(a), of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9208 (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003), as amended by R.A. No. 10364.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **R.A. No. 9208, Section 3(a):** Defines Trafficking in Persons as recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons *with or without consent*, by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power, taking advantage of vulnerability, or giving/receiving payments to control another person, *for the purpose of exploitation* (including prostitution/sexual exploitation). Critically, trafficking a child constitutes the offense even absent force/fraud.
*   **R.A. No. 9208, Section 6(a):** Defines *Qualified* Trafficking as occurring when the trafficked person is a child (defined as under 18 years of age).
*   **R.A. No. 9208, Section 10(c):** Establishes the penalty for Qualified Trafficking: Life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00 to PHP 5,000,000.00.

**Liabilities:**

*   De Dios is sentenced to life imprisonment and fined PHP 2,000,000.00.
*   De Dios is ordered to pay PHP 500,000.00 in moral damages and PHP 100,000.00 in exemplary damages to the victim.

**Factual Basis for Liability:**

*   De Dios recruited and harbored AAA, a minor (16 years old), for prostitution.
*   Entrapment operation by NBI-AHTRAD confirmed information that De Dios was peddling minors near Marikina River Park.
*   AAA testified that De Dios recruited her for prostitution in exchange for money, engaging in "gimiks" with male customers as early as May 2012.
*   De Dios offered AAA to a poseur buyer, DOJ-IACAT Agent Gay, for PHP 500.00.
*   The Court explicitly held that "Trafficking in persons may be committed also by means of taking advantage of the persons' vulnerability as minors...This element was further achieved through the offer of financial gain for the illicit services that were provided by AAA to the customers of De Dios."

**Case Law:**

*   The Court cited *People v. Hirang*, G.R. No. 223528 (January 11, 2017) (citing *People v. Casio*, 749 Phil. 458 (2014)) to reiterate the elements of Trafficking in Persons under Section 3(a) of R.A. No. 9208.  This case provides a framework for evaluating whether the elements of trafficking, including the *actus reus* (recruitment, etc.), *mens rea* (means used: force, fraud, etc., or taking advantage of vulnerability), and *purpose* (exploitation), are met.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense Argument:** De Dios argued that AAA voluntarily engaged in prostitution and that De Dios did not exert force, coercion, or fraud. The Court rejected this, emphasizing that *taking advantage of the victim's vulnerability as a minor* fulfills the "means" requirement of the statute, even without explicit force or deception.
*   **Vulnerability Standard:** This case highlights the broad interpretation of "taking advantage of vulnerability" under R.A. No. 9208 when a minor is involved. It suggests a lower threshold for proving the "means" element where the victim is a child.

**Recommendations:**

*   This case underscores the importance of due diligence in any situation where minors are involved in commercial sex activities.
*   Defenses based on "consent" or lack of force are unlikely to succeed when a minor is the alleged victim of trafficking.
*   The "vulnerability" standard articulated in this case warrants careful consideration in any trafficking case involving minors. Counsel should be prepared to address the specific factors that rendered the child vulnerable to exploitation.
