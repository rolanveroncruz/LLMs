**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Arnel Kalipayan y Aniano, G.R. No. 229829 (2018)

**Summary:**

This is an appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Arnel Kalipayan for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), for the stabbing death of his former live-in partner, Glaiza Molina. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty and damages.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Murder (Art. 248, RPC)
*   **Elements of Murder:** Proven beyond reasonable doubt:
    *   Death of Glaiza Molina.
    *   Accused-appellant caused the death.
    *   Killing not parricide or infanticide.
*   **Qualifying Circumstances:**
    *   **Treachery:** Established. The SC found that Kalipayan's attack was sudden and unexpected, affording Molina no opportunity to defend herself, satisfying the two elements of treachery: (1) employment of means of execution which gives the person attacked no opportunity to defend or retaliate, and (2) that said means of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted. The court noted that the testimonies of Josephine and Celestina supported the suddenness of the attack, and was corroborated by Medico-Legal Autopsy Report.
    *   **Evident Premeditation:** Not proven beyond reasonable doubt. While the SC found the accused had the intent to harm, the element of sufficient lapse of time for reflection was not adequately proven by the prosecution.
    *   **Abuse of Superior Strength:** Considered absorbed by the qualifying circumstance of treachery.
    *   **Dwelling:** Considered an aggravating circumstance as the crime was committed in the residence of the offended party and the latter did not give any provocation.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua (due to Republic Act No. 9346 abolishing the death penalty, despite the presence of dwelling as an aggravating circumstance). No eligibility for parole.
*   **Damages:**
    *   Civil Indemnity: Increased to P100,000.
    *   Moral Damages: Increased to P100,000.
    *   Exemplary Damages: Increased to P100,000.
    *   Funeral Expenses: P30,000 (sustained).
    *   Interest: 6% per annum on the aggregate monetary awards from finality of the decision until full payment.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Arnel Kalipayan:** Criminal liability for murder, civil liability to the heirs of Glaiza Molina for damages as specified.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Challenge to Treachery Finding:** The defense argued the attack wasn't sudden due to an alleged prior commotion. However, the SC found the prosecution witnesses credible and their testimonies consistent.
*   **Evident Premeditation Argument:** Although the SC ruled against its presence, the initial planning to confront the victim could be argued to show a degree of premeditation, though not sufficient for qualifying the crime as murder on this basis alone.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 248, RPC:** Murder
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibition of Death Penalty
*   **People v. Jugueta, G.R. No. 202124, April 5, 2016:**  Basis for standardized damage amounts.
*   **Candelaria v. People of the Philippines, 749 Phil. 517, 530 (2014):** Doctrine that an appeal throws the entire case up for review.
*   **People of the Philippines v. Taboga, 426 Phil. 908, 928-929 (2002):** Sanctity of the dwelling.
