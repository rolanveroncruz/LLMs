**Case Summary: *Camarines Sur IV Electric Cooperative, Inc. vs. Expedita L. Aquino*, G.R. No. 167691, September 23, 2008**

**Core Issue:** Whether the respondent's complaint for damages stated a cause of action against the petitioner electric cooperative, and the timeliness of respondent's appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Background:** Respondent leased a commercial building, had electricity restored in the name of the previous tenant (Paglinawan), and failed to pay subsequent electric bills.
*   **Alleged Pilferage:** Petitioner inspected the property, alleged electricity pilferage in violation of RA 7832 (Anti-Electricity Pilferage Act), and demanded payment of differential billing and penalties under threat of disconnection.
*   **Disconnection & Damages Claim:** Respondent refused to pay and was disconnected. She filed a complaint for damages, alleging business interruption, lost income, and rental expenses.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** The RTC initially denied the motion to dismiss stating there was a contract given the possession of the property but later granted petitioner's motion for reconsideration arguing the prior connection was in another's name.
*   **Procedural Issue:** The motion for reconsideration lacked compliance with the 3-day rule, as the motion was sent too close to the hearing date.
*   **Court of Appeals (CA) Decision:** The CA reversed the RTC, holding that a cause of action existed, and the existence of a contract was a matter of defense. The CA did not address the appeal's timeliness.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Camarines Sur IV Electric Cooperative):** Obligation to provide electricity to paying customers. Potential liability for damages if disconnection was wrongful.
*   **Respondent (Expedita L. Aquino):** Obligation to pay for electricity consumed. Potential liability under RA 7832 if found guilty of pilferage.

**Potential Risks & Legal Issues:**

*   **RA 7832 (Anti-Electricity Pilferage Act):** The allegation of electricity pilferage creates potential criminal liability for the respondent and could justify the disconnection if proven.
*   **Breach of Contract (or Lack Thereof):** Although no formal contract existed in the Respondent's name, the CA initially viewed the matter as an issue of defense and needed trial on the merits. The Supreme Court's ruling highlights that even without a direct contractual relationship, a cause of action can exist.
*   **Procedural Due Process & Notice Requirements:** Respondent's failure to comply with the 3-day notice rule under Section 4, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court regarding the motion for reconsideration was fatal to her appeal. This failure resulted in the RTC decision becoming final and executory. This underscores the strict application of procedural rules. *Garcia v. Sandiganbayan* (G.R. No. 167103) reinforces the importance of the 3-day rule and the consequences of non-compliance.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7832 (Anti-Electricity and Electric Transmission Lines/Materials Pilferage Act of 1994):** Relevant regarding the alleged pilferage.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 15, Section 4:** Critical regarding the 3-day notice rule for motions.
*   **Ilano v. Espanol, G.R. No. 161756 (2005):** Defines the elements of a cause of action.
*   **Garcia v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 167103 (2006):** Discusses the failure to comply with Sec. 4 of Rule 15.
*   **Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank v. CA, G.R. No. 143896 (2005):** Defines a cause of action.
*   **Sarming v. Dy, et al., 432 Phil. 685 (2002):** Participation in a contract is not an element in considering whether or not a complaint states a cause of action.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Existence of Implied Contract:** The initial disagreement between the RTC and CA centered around whether the supply of electricity to the leased premises, even without a formal contract in the respondent's name, constituted an implied contract sufficient to establish a cause of action.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, REVERSED the CA decision, and DISMISSED CA-G.R. CV No. 81666 because the lower court decision already became final and executory due to a procedural defect.

**Conclusion:** This case underscores the importance of strict compliance with procedural rules, particularly the 3-day notice rule. Although the respondent may have had a valid claim for damages, her failure to properly file her motion for reconsideration resulted in the loss of her right to appeal.
