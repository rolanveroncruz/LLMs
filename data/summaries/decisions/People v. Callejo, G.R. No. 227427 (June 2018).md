## Legal Document Summary: People v. Callejo

**Case Citation:** 832 Phil. 881 (G.R. No. 227427, June 06, 2018)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision reversing and setting aside the Court of Appeals' decision, acquitting the accused-appellants.

**Core Issue:** Whether the CA erred in upholding the conviction of Callejo and Antoque for violation of Section 5 (illegal sale of drugs) and Callejo for violation of Section 11 (illegal possession of drugs), Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court acquitted the accused due to:

1.  **Failure to comply with Section 21, RA 9165:** The prosecution failed to prove the apprehending team (SAID-SOTG) complied with the mandatory requirements for the seizure, initial custody, and handling of seized drugs.
2.  **Broken Chain of Custody:** Gaps existed in the chain of custody, creating reasonable doubt as to the identity and integrity of the seized items. Specifically, the testimonies of PO3 Castillo and PSI Bacani, while stipulated to, did not cover the specific handling and transfer of the seized items. *Cites People v. Sanchez, 590 Phil. 214 (2008), and Mallillin v. People, 576 Phil. 576 (2008).*
3.  **Violation of Three-Witness Rule:** The SAID-SOTG failed to secure the presence of representatives from the DOJ and media, in addition to an elected public official (Kagawad Bernal) as required by Sec 21. Kagawad Bernal was only called to the scene *after* the arrest and seizure. Cites *People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014)* regarding the importance of insulating witnesses.
4.  **Material Inconsistencies in Testimony:** Contradictory statements regarding the identity and role of the confidential informant undermined the credibility of the police narrative.
5.  **Inadequate Justification for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution failed to justify any deviations from the procedures outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR. The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty was insufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence. Cites *People v. Enriquez, 718 Phil. 352 (2013)* regarding the need for justification for divergence from prescribed procedures.
6.  **2010 AIDSOTF Manual:** Reierates Strict compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 and the IRR is mandated under the 2010 PNP Manual on Anti-Illegal Drugs Operation and Investigation (2010 AIDSOTF Manual)

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, RA 9165:** Defines and penalizes illegal sale, delivery, and distribution of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 11, Article II, RA 9165:** Defines and penalizes illegal possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, Article II, RA 9165 (original version):** Prescribes the procedure for the custody and disposition of confiscated drugs, including immediate physical inventory and photographing in the presence of the accused, representatives from the media and DOJ, and an elected public official. The case emphasizes the mandatory nature of this provision.
*   **Section 21(a), Article II, IRR of RA 9165:** Details the location for inventory and photographing and includes a saving clause for non-compliance due to justifiable grounds, provided the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved.

**Obligations:**

*   Apprehending officers have a strict obligation to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165.
*   The prosecution has a duty to prove beyond reasonable doubt compliance with Section 21 and to justify any deviations.

**Liabilities:**

*   Apprehending officers face potential administrative and criminal liabilities for planting evidence (Section 29, RA 9165) and violating regulations (Section 32, RA 9165).

**Potential Risks:**

*   Evidence can be suppressed if there is non-compliance with Section 21.
*   Acquittal of the accused if reasonable doubt exists due to procedural lapses.
*   Prosecution could face scrutiny for relying on presumption of regularity instead of actual compliance.

**Case Law Referenced:**

*   People v. Sanchez, 590 Phil. 214 (2008): Stipulations on forensic chemist testimony must cover handling before and after possession.
*   Mallillin v. People, 576 Phil. 576 (2008): Emphasizes the stringent standard for authenticating narcotic substances.
*   People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014): Importance of insulating witnesses to prevent planting of evidence.
*   People v. Enriquez, 718 Phil. 352 (2013): Divergence from prescribed procedure requires justification.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Justifiable Grounds Clause in IRR:** What constitutes a "justifiable ground" for non-compliance with Section 21 is subject to interpretation, but this decision makes clear that the prosecution bears the burden of proving said grounds.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The decision highlights the limitations of relying on the presumption of regularity, especially when there is evidence of procedural lapses.

**Analysis for Litigation:**

*   This case can be cited to argue for the exclusion of evidence obtained in violation of Section 21 of RA 9165.
*   Attorneys should scrutinize the chain of custody and challenge any gaps in the documentation or testimony.
*   The absence of required witnesses (DOJ, media, elected official) should be challenged aggressively, emphasizing the prosecution's failure to justify their absence.
*   Defense counsel should challenge the credibility of police testimony, particularly regarding the use of confidential informants.

**Concurring Opinion:** Justice Peralta's Concurring Opinion reinforces the importance of the 3 witness rule and clarifies that in the absence of witnesses, the prosecution has a burden of proving a valid cause for non compliance with the procedures laid down in Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended. It also emphasizes that non-observance of administrative procedures should not affect the validity of the seizure, as long as the admissibility of evidence is decided in accordance with rules of evidence.
