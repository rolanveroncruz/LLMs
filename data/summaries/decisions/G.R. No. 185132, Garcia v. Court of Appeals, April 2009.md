**Legal Document Summary: Garcia, Jr. v. Court of Appeals**

**Case:** G.R. No. 185132, April 24, 2009 (604 Phil. 677)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Governor Enrique T. Garcia, Jr., Aurelio C. Angeles, Jr., Emerlinda S. Talento, Rodolfo H. De Mesa (Province officials of Bataan)
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals, Ombudsman, Department of Interior and Local Government, Josechito B. Gonzaga, Ruel A. Masino, Alfredo B. Santos (Private Complainants)

**Subject Matter:**  Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus questioning the CA's deferral of action on Petitioners' application for injunctive relief, specifically a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against the Ombudsman's order of preventive suspension.

**Background:**

*   Tax delinquency sale of Sunrise Paper Products Industries, Inc. properties acquired by the province of Bataan.
*   Sunrise filed an injunction suit (Civil Case No. 8164) against the sale. Other creditors intervened.
*   Compromise agreement entered into between the province (represented by the governor) and Sunrise, approved by the *Sangguniang Panlalawigan*.
*   Dismissal of the civil case sought due to non-compliance with Section 267 of RA 7160 (Local Government Code - LGC), which requires prior deposit of sale amount.
*   The trial court refused dismissal and invalidated the auction sale and compromise agreement.
*   The province questioned the decision of the trial court in G.R. No. 181311 pending before the Supreme Court, which issued a status quo order.
*   Private respondents filed a complaint with the Ombudsman based on the trial court's decision, administratively and criminally charging the petitioners with violations of Section 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), falsification of public documents, and other offenses.
*   The Ombudsman ordered the preventive suspension of petitioners (OMB-L-A-08-0039-A) pursuant to Section 24 of RA 6770 (The Ombudsman Act) and Section 9, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 7, as amended.
*   Petitioners filed a petition in the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 106026) challenging the preventive suspension and seeking a TRO.
*   The CA deferred action on the TRO, prompting the Petition before the Supreme Court.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Propriety of CA's Deferral:** The central issue is whether the CA gravely abused its discretion by holding in abeyance action on the Petitioners' urgent prayer for injunctive relief (TRO) against the Ombudsman's preventive suspension order.
*   **Preventive Suspension:** The Ombudsman's order of preventive suspension was based on an administrative case filed against Petitioners, related to acts performed during their term as public officials of the province. The order cites Section 24 of RA 6770 and Section 9 of Rule III of Administrative Order No. 7.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that the CA failed to dutifully and prudently exercise its discretion, thus violating fundamental principles of law and Rules of Court. Defined grave abuse of discretion as such capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.
*   **Forum Shopping:** The dissenting opinions note a potential issue of forum shopping, as the petition before the Supreme Court overlaps with the one before the CA, seeking similar remedies.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** The need for prior motion for reconsideration with the CA before elevating the case to the SC was raised.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6770:** The Ombudsman Act
*   **RA 3019:** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, specifically Sections 3(e) and (g).
*   **RA 7160:** Local Government Code, Section 267 (regarding actions assailing the validity of tax sales).
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 65 (Certiorari, Prohibition, Mandamus), Rule 58 (Preliminary Injunction).
*   ***Gobenciong v. Court of Appeals*** (immediate effectivity of Ombudsman orders)
*   ***Gov. Manuel M. Lapid v. Court of Appeals***- Suspension is merely preventive and not meant as a penalty, and Section 27 of the Ombudsman Act provides that such provisionary order is immediately effective and executory.
*   ***Garcia v. Mojica*** (G.R. No. 139043, September 10, 1999, 314 SCRA 207- Facts indicating petitioners' intent to commit fraud, for which they are being charged, only became established when the RTC issued in June 2007 (after petitioner Garcia had been re-elected during the May 2007 elections) the decision in the civil case from which the administrative charges arose.
*   ***PAL Employees Savings and Loan Association, Inc. v. Philippine Airlines, Inc.***  Petitioners' prayer for relief in this petition is, just like in PAL Employees Savings and Loan Association, Inc. v. Philippine Airlines, Inc., a necessary consequence of the CA's inaction on their pleas.
*   ***Benguet Management Corporation v. Court of Appeals*** Since we are not a trier of facts, following our disposition in Benguet Management Corporation v. Court of Appeals, we should remand this case to the CA for a speedy resolution on the merits.
*   ***Diamond Builders Conglomeration v. Country Bankers Insurance Corporation*** Exception to the general rule is that a motion for reconsideration is an indispensable condition before the filing of a petition for certiorari.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Preventive Suspension:** Potential disruption of governance in Bataan if the suspension is implemented.  Risk of public discontent.
*   **Administrative/Criminal Charges:** Petitioners face potential administrative and criminal liability if found guilty of the charges filed before the Ombudsman.  Potential disbarment for Atty. Angeles.
*   **Civil Liability:**  Potential liability to Sunrise and other creditors of Sunrise Paper Products if the trial court's decision invalidating the auction sale is upheld.
*   **Forum Shopping (if proven):** Dismissal of either or both petitions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Jurisdiction of the Ombudsman:** Whether the Ombudsman has jurisdiction over acts committed during a prior term of office (raised by petitioners, citing settled jurisprudence). If the complaint-affidavit of the private respondents will no longer have a leg to stand on.
*   **Validity of the Compromise Agreement:** Whether the compromise agreement between the province and Sunrise was valid, especially given the alleged non-compliance with Section 267 of the LGC.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Whether the CA's deferral truly amounted to grave abuse of discretion warranting the SC's intervention.
*   **Forum shopping issue**: whether there are similar remedies availed by petitioner, whether or not they have basis.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court PARTIALLY GRANTED the petition, REVERSING and SETTING ASIDE the CA's resolution deferring action on the application for injunctive relief.
*   The TRO issued by the SC was maintained until further orders.
*   The case was REMANDED to the CA for a determination on the merits.
