## Legal Document Summary: *Phil. Federation of Credit Cooperatives, Inc. (PECCI) v. NLRC and Victoria Abril* (G.R. No. 121071)

**Nature:** This case involves a Petition for Certiorari challenging the NLRC's decision reversing the Labor Arbiter and finding that Victoria Abril was illegally dismissed.

**Key Issue:** Whether Victoria Abril was a regular employee entitled to security of tenure or a probationary/project/contractual employee whose employment was validly terminated.

**Facts:**

*   Abril was hired by PECCI in 1982. After various positions, in 1990 she became a Regional Field Officer under a contract stipulating a 6-month probationary period.
*   After the probationary period, she continued working, then signed another one-year contract.
*   Upon expiration of the one-year contract, PECCI terminated her employment.
*   Abril filed a complaint for illegal dismissal.

**NLRC Ruling:** The NLRC reversed the Labor Arbiter, ruling that Abril had become a regular employee and was illegally dismissed. It ordered reinstatement with backwages.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the NLRC decision.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Article 281 of the Labor Code (Probationary Employment):** The Court emphasizes that an employee who continues working after the probationary period becomes a regular employee.
*   **Article 280 of the Labor Code (Regular and Casual Employment):** PECCI argued Abril was either a casual or project employee, but the Court found this argument misplaced.
*   **Contractual Employee Exception (Brent School, Inc. v. Zamora):** The Court cites *Brent School* to highlight that fixed-term employment contracts are valid only when entered into knowingly and voluntarily, without coercion or unequal bargaining power. This is relevant because PECCI tried to characterize the final contract as a fixed-term contract.
*   **Ambiguity in Contract of Employment:** The Court found the contract to be ambiguous due to conflicting provisions regarding the probationary period and the nature of employment.
*   **Contract of Adhesion:** Since the contract was drafted by PECCI, any ambiguity is construed strictly against them.
*   **Article 1702 of the Civil Code:** In case of doubt, labor contracts are construed in favor of the laborer.
*   **Security of Tenure:** Abril, having completed her probationary period and continued in employment, attained regular employee status and the constitutional and statutory right to security of tenure.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   PECCI has a legal obligation to reinstate Abril to her previous position (or an equivalent position) and pay her full backwages from the date of her illegal dismissal.
*   PECCI is liable for illegally dismissing a regular employee without just or authorized cause as required under Articles 282, 283 and 284 of the Labor Code.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguous employment contract and the inconsistent arguments presented by PECCI regarding Abril's employment status were detrimental to their case. The Court strictly construed the contract against them.
*   PECCI's attempt to classify Abril as a project employee or employee with a fixed term was flawed, as there was no clear demonstration of project completion or termination of employment.
*   The retroactive application of jurisprudence favorable to employees should be taken into account.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 281, Labor Code (Probationary Employment)**
*   **Article 280, Labor Code (Regular and Casual Employment)**
*   **Articles 282, 283 and 284 of the Labor Code (Termination of employment)**
*   **Article 1702, Civil Code (Interpretation of contracts in favor of the laborer)**
*   **Brent School, Inc. v. Zamora, 181 SCRA 702 (1990):** Guidelines for valid fixed-term employment contracts.
*   **International Catholic Migration v. NLRC, 169 SCRA 606 (1989):** Definition of probationary employee.
*    **Villanueva v. NLRC,[6] G.R. No. 127448, September 10, 1998:** Interpretation against the party who drafted contract of adhesion.

**Conclusion:**

The case reiterates the principle that probationary employment is a trial period. If the employer allows the employee to continue working beyond the probationary period, without clear communication or a new agreement, the employee becomes regularized. Ambiguous contracts of employment will be construed against the employer, and the right to security of tenure will be protected.
