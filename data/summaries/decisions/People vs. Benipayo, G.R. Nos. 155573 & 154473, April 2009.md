## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Benipayo* (G.R. Nos. 154473 & 155573)

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari assailing RTC Orders dismissing libel cases against Alfredo L. Benipayo, then COMELEC Chairman.

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC has jurisdiction over the libel cases to the exclusion of all other courts, specifically considering the potential jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.

**Holding:** RTC has exclusive original jurisdiction over written defamation cases under Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by RA 4363. The petitions were granted, the dismissal orders were overturned, and cases were remanded.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Article 360, RPC (as amended):** Explicitly vests jurisdiction over written defamation cases in the RTC of the province/city where the libelous article is printed/published or where the offended party resides.

*   **Jurisdictional Argument (Respondent):** Argued lack of jurisdiction due to:
    *   Impeachable Officer Status: Initially claimed immunity due to being an impeachable officer. This was rendered moot.
    *   "In Relation to Office": Alleged libel committed in his official capacity as COMELEC Chair, placing jurisdiction with the Sandiganbayan.

*   **Court's Rejection of "In Relation to Office" Argument:** The Court held that the RTC's exclusive jurisdiction over written defamations under Article 360, RPC, trumps any potential jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan based on the "in relation to office" clause. The Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction (PD 1606, as amended by RA 8249) does not implicitly repeal/modify the RTC's exclusive jurisdiction over libel.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 360, Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 4363):** Determines jurisdiction for libel cases.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1606, as amended by Republic Act No. 8249:** Defines the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.
*   **Jalandoni v. Endaya, 55 SCRA 261:** Affirms RTC's exclusive jurisdiction over libel cases.
*   **Bocobo v. Estanislao, 72 SCRA 520:** Reaffirms that expanded jurisdiction cannot be exercised over libel cases.
*   **Manzano v. Hon. Valera, 354 Phil. 66:** Elaboration and reiterated that the RPC is of a special nature.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Substantive Defamation Elements:** While the Court clarifies jurisdiction, the actual *mens rea* for libel is crucial.
*   **"In Relation to Office" - Revisited:** While the Court ruled RTC jurisdiction is primary, the nature of the statements could still be raised later, and the statements could be misconstrued as not within the office.
*   **Continuing Litigation:** Remand to the RTC means the cases will proceed, incurring further legal costs.
*   **Prejudice:** The earlier motion of one of the RTC judges to inhibit remained unresolved.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court clarified that the RTC has exclusive jurisdiction over written defamation cases under Article 360 of the RPC. The "in relation to office" argument is insufficient to divest the RTC of jurisdiction in libel cases. The case now goes back to the respective RTCs.
