**Legal Document Summary: Maricalum Mining Corp. vs. NLRC, Sipalay Mine Free Labor Union, and Cecilio T. Saludar (G.R. No. 124711)**

**Case Overview:** This is a petition for certiorari challenging the NLRC's decision ordering Maricalum Mining Corporation to reinstate Cecilio Saludar or pay backwages following a revival of a judgment against Marinduque Mining and Industrial Corporation (MMIC), whose assets Maricalum acquired.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Assumption of Liabilities:** The core issue is whether Maricalum assumed MMIC's liabilities, specifically the 1984 illegal dismissal judgment in favor of Saludar. The Deed of Transfer between PNB/DBP and Maricalum contains a clause (Section 3.01) where Maricalum agrees to be solely liable for any liability due or owing to any other person (natural or corporate).  The NLRC interpreted this to include the judgment debt to Saludar.
*   **Revival of Judgment:** Saludar filed an action to revive the 1984 judgment against Maricalum after the original decision remained unenforced due to MMIC's assets being foreclosed. The revival action was filed within the 10-year prescriptive period.
*   **Reinstatement/Backwages:** The NLRC affirmed the Labor Arbiter's order for Maricalum to reinstate Saludar or pay three years of backwages.

**Potential Liabilities:**

*   **Monetary Liability:** Maricalum faces liability for the P52,010.55 representing three years of backwages (as of the Labor Arbiter's decision) plus potential liability for reinstatement.
*   **Continuing Liability:** The reinstatement order creates a continuing obligation and potential liability for future wages and benefits.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Liability Due or Owing":** The scope of the "liability due or owing" clause in the Deed of Transfer could be contentious. Maricalum could argue it was not intended to encompass labor judgments, especially ones arising from illegal dismissal.
*   **Successor Liability Doctrine:** The court relies heavily on the successor liability doctrine, asserting that Maricalum voluntarily recognized and absorbed MMIC's employee obligations. Maricalum may try to argue it did not intend to assume *all* liabilities, only those related to employees it rehired.
*   **Enforceability of Reinstatement:** Given the time elapsed since the original illegal dismissal and the change in circumstances, the feasibility and fairness of reinstatement could be challenged.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Supreme Court Circular No. 04-94:**  The court addresses the applicability of the certificate of non-forum shopping to NLRC proceedings, holding that substantial compliance is sufficient. This is supported by *Loyola v. Court of Appeals* (245 SCRA 477).
*   **Aldeguer v. Gemelo (68 Phil. 421):** Affirms NLRC's jurisdiction to revive its own judgments.
*   **Development Bank of the Philippines v. National Labor Relations Commission (183 SCRA 328 (1990)):** Supports the impleading of a party (DBP in that case) to satisfy a judgment even if not an original party.
*   **Article 291 (formerly 290) of the Labor Code** (implied): This governs the prescriptive period for labor claims (relevant to the revival action).
*   **Section 6, Rule 1, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (as amended)** Supports the court's reasoning for a liberal interpretation of procedural rules to achieve a just result.

**Legal Strategy Considerations (for Maricalum):**

*   **Challenge the Interpretation of the Deed of Transfer:** Argue that the "liability due or owing" clause was not intended to cover legacy labor judgments and that its scope is limited.  Introduce evidence of the parties' intent.
*   **Argue Lack of Due Process:** While the Court addresses it, reassert that impleading Maricalum at the execution stage deprived it of due process in contesting the original judgment.
*   **Seek Equitable Relief Regarding Reinstatement:** Argue that reinstatement is impractical or impossible due to the passage of time and changed circumstances. Propose a reasonable monetary settlement instead.
*   **Investigate Whether Employee Mitigation Occurred:** Investigate if Saludar acquired income in the time since the illegal dismissal, impacting the amount of backwages owed.
