Okay, here is a summary of the provided legal document, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Sofia Aniosa Salandanan v. Spouses Ma. Isabel and Bayani Mendez*, G.R. No. 160280, March 13, 2009.

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) and Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) decisions in an ejectment case.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Sofia Aniosa Salandanan (claiming ownership of the property).
*   **Respondents:** Spouses Ma. Isabel and Bayani Mendez (claiming ownership by virtue of a deed of donation and holding a Transfer Certificate of Title).
*   **Defendants in Original Ejectment:** Spouses Delfin and Carmen Fernandez (relatives of Salandanan, originally occupying the property).

**Key Provisions and Factual Background:**

*   The case originated from an ejectment complaint filed by Respondents against the Fernandez Spouses in the MeTC.
*   Respondents claim ownership via a deed of donation from the Salandanan Spouses and possess TCT No. 246767.
*   The Fernandez Spouses defend by claiming Sofia Salandanan is the true owner and that the deed of donation was fraudulently obtained. They also claim Delfin Fernandez has occupied the property "since time immemorial" with Salandanan's permission.
*   A separate RTC case (Civil Case No. 01-101487) for annulment/revocation of the title and reconveyance of the property is pending, filed by Salandanan (represented by Delfin Fernandez, Jr.) against the Mendezes and the Registry of Deeds.
*   MeTC ruled in favor of Respondents, ordering the Fernandez Spouses to vacate and pay rent.
*   RTC affirmed the MeTC decision. A Writ of Execution was issued.
*   Salandanan filed a Motion for Clarification and Intervention in the CA, arguing that the decision improperly included her, as she claims ownership in her own right.
*   The CA denied the Motion for Clarification and Intervention as belatedly filed and because her rights are already protected in a separate proceedings, affirming the lower courts' decisions and ordering the Fernandez Spouses and all those claiming under them, including Salandanan, to vacate.

**Key Issues:**

1.  Whether the CA erred in including Salandanan in its decision despite her not being a party to the original ejectment case, violating her due process rights.
2.  Whether the CA erred in denying Salandanan's Motion for Intervention.
3.  Whether the CA erred in not addressing the issue of ownership in determining the right to possession.

**Court's Ruling:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition and affirmed the CA decision.

**Rationale:**

*   **Intervention:** Intervention was properly denied because it was filed after the CA had rendered a decision. Also, the summary nature of ejectment proceedings requires expeditious resolution. The issue of ownership raised by Salandanan cannot be properly resolved in an ejectment case per Rule 70, Section 18 of the Rules of Court. Her rights regarding ownership can be fully adjudicated in the pending RTC case for annulment of title. *Five Star Marketing Co., Inc. v. Booc* is cited regarding the purpose of ejectment. *Malison v. Court of Appeals* is cited regarding the issue of possession, nothing more than actual physical possession.
*   **Inclusion of Salandanan in CA Decision:** Even though Salandanan was not a party to the original ejectment case, the Court found that she could be bound by the judgment because she was (a) a relative or privy of the Fernandez Spouses, and (b) effectively acting as their agent by occupying the property after the RTC ordered execution, attempting to frustrate the judgment. *Stilgrove v. Sabas* is cited regarding those who can be bound by an ejectment judgment. The court emphasized that she was only placed on the property to prevent the execution.
*   **Ownership vs. Possession:** The Court deferred to the lower courts' findings that the respondents had a better right to possession based on their Torrens Title. The Court noted it could not collaterally attack the respondent's Torrens Title in this ejectment proceeding. Citing *Malison v. Court of Appeals*

**Potential Liabilities and Risks:**

*   **Ejectment:** Salandanan faces the risk of being evicted from the property. The court-ordered ejectment of the Spouses Fernandez and all those claiming rights under them directly affects her, despite her claim of ownership.
*   **Collateral Estoppel/Res Judicata:** While the RTC case for annulment of title is still pending, the adverse findings in the ejectment case regarding possession, particularly the finding that Salandanan occupied the property to frustrate the judgment, could have some persuasive if not preclusive effect in the RTC case.
*   **Damages:** While the current decision does not assess damages against Salandanan directly, a future decision of the separate case could open her up to further liability, and the monthly rental established would presumably continue to accumulate if Spouses Fernandez have not continued to pay it.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The nature and extent of the "permission" granted by the Salandanan Spouses to the Fernandez Spouses to occupy the property is not fully elaborated, which could impact any claims of right of possession derived from the original owners.
*   The circumstances surrounding the execution of the deed of donation are clearly contentious. While the Supreme Court acknowledged the pending case for annulment, the findings in this ejectment case could influence the RTC's assessment of the fraud claim.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Rules of Court, Rule 19, Sections 1 & 2 (Intervention)
*   Rules of Court, Rule 70, Section 18 (Judgment in ejectment is conclusive only to possession)
*   *Five Star Marketing Co., Inc. v. Booc*, G.R. No. 143331, October 5, 2007 (Purpose of ejectment).
*   *Malison v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 147776, July 10, 2007 (Possession in ejectment; collateral attack on title).
*   *Stilgrove v. Sabas*, A.M. No. P-06-2257, November 29, 2006 (Parties bound by ejectment judgment).

**Recommendations:**

*   Focus on vigorously pursuing the RTC case for annulment of title and reconveyance to demonstrate fraud in the deed of donation.
*   Develop a factual record to rebut the finding that Salandanan's presence on the property was solely to frustrate the judgment and show an independent basis for her claim of possession.
*   Consider seeking a stay of execution in the ejectment case pending the outcome of the RTC case, although the chances of success are low given the existing adverse rulings.
