Here's a legal summary of the document, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Office of the Ombudsman v. Espiritu*, G.R. No. 174826 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari, challenging the Court of Appeals' decision which reversed the Ombudsman's finding of administrative liability against Respondent Espiritu.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Background:** A contractor (Huevos/A.H. Construction) sought a building permit from Respondent (City Engineer/Building Official) for a DOH project in Marikina.  Respondent initially denied the permit citing prior violations by the contractor, including an illegal structure and issues related to the city's road widening project. A waste water plant which would obstruct the roadway, and an incinerator which is not allowed in Marikina City were included.
*   **DPWH Intervention:**  The DOH appealed to the DPWH Secretary, who ruled in favor of the DOH and instructed Respondent to issue the permit upon compliance with all requirements (National Building Code & IRR).
*   **Refiled Application:** The DOH refiled but failed to include the contractor's renewed business permit, which was required by Marikina City.  Respondent again refused to issue the permit.
*   **Ombudsman Decision:**  The Ombudsman found Respondent guilty of Conduct Grossly Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and imposed a 6-month suspension. The ombudsman stated that the respondent's continuous denial of the application after being informed of the Decision of Secretary Datumanong is a showing of his manifest partiality against the applicant.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:**  The Court of Appeals *reversed* the Ombudsman's decision. It held that Respondent was merely enforcing laws and local policies and did not act with malice or bad faith. The COA stated that on both occasions, petitioner was merely enforcing local policies, along with the requirements of the National Building Code, in the matter of issuing building permits.

**Issue:**

*   Did Respondent's non-issuance of the building permit constitute Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service?

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court *affirmed* the Court of Appeals' decision, *denying* the Ombudsman's petition. It held that the DOH failed to fully comply with *all* requirements, specifically the contractor's business permit as required by Marikina City. The court reasoned that requirements to be complied with for the issuance of building permits are not limited to those mentioned in the National Building Code and local government units may require clearances affecting buildings. The Contractor's non-submission of a renewed business permit is a valid reason for respondent not to grant the building permit applied for.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1096 (National Building Code):** Governing law on building permits. Sections 301 and 302 are explicitly referenced.
*   **Revised IRR of the National Building Code:** Details the requirements for building permits.
*   **Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160):**  Clarifies the role of the City/Municipal Engineer as the Local Building Official (Section 477).
*   **Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987):** Section 22, par. 6 is used as basis for penalty in the decision.
*   ***Commission on Audit v. Hinampas, G.R. No. 158672, 7 August 2007, 529 SCRA 245, 260.***
*   ***Jugueta v. Estacio, A.M. No. CA-04-17-P, 25 November 2004, 444 SCRA 10, 15.***
*   ***Morong Water District v. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman, 385 Phil. 44, 55 (2000).***

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The interpretation of "full compliance with all requirements" following the DPWH Secretary's order. The Ombudsman argued it was ministerial but the Supreme Court interpreted this to mean compliance with local regulations as well.
*   The degree to which a Building Official can rely on local policies and city government objections, even after a DPWH ruling.
*   The issue of "shifting" grounds for denial. The Ombudsman claimed Espiritu kept changing reasons, indicating bias, but the Court found the business permit requirement to be a valid and new issue at the time of the refiled application.

**Potential Risks:**

*   This case could be used to argue that Building Officials have wide discretion in enforcing local requirements, even after DPWH orders, potentially leading to delays and subjective application of rules.
*   There is a risk of inconsistency in application of the "substantial evidence" standard in administrative cases. The Supreme Court found that the complainant did not substantiate his allegations in this case.
