## Legal Document Summary: People v. Bascugin (G.R. No. 184704)

**Case Summary:** This is a final appeal to the Supreme Court (SC) regarding the conviction of Leodegario Bascugin for rape with homicide under Art. 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353) in relation to RA 7659. The SC affirmed the CA decision, with modifications regarding damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Rape with Homicide (Art. 266-A & 266-B, RPC, as amended).
*   **Conviction:** Guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua (due to RA 9346 abolishing the death penalty).

**Key Obligations:**

*   Defendant is obligated to serve reclusion perpetua.
*   Defendant is obligated to pay damages to the victim's heirs.

**Key Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** For rape with homicide.
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   Civil Indemnity: PhP 100,000.00
    *   Moral Damages: PhP 75,000.00
    *   Temperate Damages: PhP 25,000.00
    *   Exemplary Damages: PhP 50,000.00

**Key Evidence & Arguments:**

*   **Prosecution Evidence:**
    *   Circumstantial evidence connecting Bascugin to the crime scene and victim.
    *   Medico-legal evidence confirming sexual intercourse and cause of death.
    *   Bascugin's blood matching the victim's blood type on his clothing.
    *   Seminal stains on victim's clothing.
    *   **Crucially:** Bascugin's admission of guilt on the witness stand.
*   **Defense Arguments:**
    *   Lack of evidence of force/intimidation.
    *   Blood on clothing doesn't prove guilt.
    *   Withdrawal of initial guilty plea should expunge it from the record.
    *   **SC Rejection:** Bascugin's judicial confession, given freely and intelligently, outweighed these arguments. Circumstantial evidence corroborates the confession.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Voluntariness of Confession:**  While the SC found the confession "freely, intelligently, and deliberately given," arguments could be made (though unsuccessful here) regarding the defendant's understanding of the consequences of his testimony, particularly considering his history of changing his plea.
*   **Weight of Circumstantial Evidence:** The defense challenged the probative value of the circumstantial evidence. Although the SC deemed it sufficient, reliance on circumstantial evidence always carries some inherent risk.

**Note:** The initial guilty plea and its subsequent withdrawal create a complicated procedural history, however, ultimately, the SC focused on the latter confession. It is recommended to thoroughly review the full transcript of the trial, especially the testimony of the accused where he confessed to the crime, to fully appreciate the context and possible vulnerabilities of that key evidence.
