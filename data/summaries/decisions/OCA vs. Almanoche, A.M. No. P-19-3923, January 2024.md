**Case Summary: A.M. No. P-19-3923, Office of the Court Administrator vs. Nemia Alma Y. Almanoche**

**Nature:** Administrative disciplinary case against Nemia Alma Y. Almanoche, a Court Stenographer III, for alleged corrupt practices.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Serious Dishonesty under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court (as amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC). Almanoche allegedly solicited PHP 20,000 from Jean Baguio in exchange for the dismissal of a criminal case against Baguio's sons, claiming the money was for "the judge, the fiscal, and the PAO."
*   **Evidence:** The primary evidence is Baguio's affidavit and testimony. Corroborating, though hearsay, evidence comes from Judge Camannong, Prosecutor Panganiban, and Atty. Iba√±ez regarding Baguio's consistent narration of the incident. The Supreme Court explicitly relaxes the hearsay rule due to Baguio's affidavit and the administrative nature of the proceedings, citing *Re: Verified Complaint dated July 13, 2015 of Alfonso Umali, Jr. v. Justice Hernandez, 781 Phil. 375 (2016)*.
*   **Defense:** Almanoche denies the allegations, claiming she only offered advice based on tribal affiliation and did not solicit or receive money. She provides an affidavit from Loreta "Auring" O. Rico.
*   **Mitigating Factors (Rejected):** While Judge Barroso initially appreciated Almanoche's length of service, first-time offender status, and lack of receipt of the money, the Supreme Court ultimately rejects these mitigating factors, emphasizing the high ethical standards required of judiciary personnel, citing *Atty. Pasok v. Diaz, 677 Phil. 520 (2011)*.
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits) and disqualification from re-employment in the government.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Court personnel have a stringent obligation to uphold ethical standards and maintain public faith in the judiciary. *Judge Perez v. Roxas, 834 Phil. 163 (2018)* highlights the duty to preserve public faith in our courts.
*   Almanoche is liable for serious dishonesty, defined as a disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Precedent:** This case sets a precedent for strict enforcement of ethical standards within the judiciary, even for seemingly lower-level employees. The rejection of mitigating factors underscores the zero-tolerance policy for conduct that undermines public trust.
*   **Hearsay:** The reliance on hearsay evidence, even with corroboration, could be challenged on due process grounds, although the relaxation of the rule is explicitly justified within the context of the administrative proceedings.
*   **Retroactive Application:** The application of the amended Rule 140 to past actions could raise concerns about fairness. However, Section 24 explicitly allows for retroactive application.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court (as amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC):** Governing the discipline of judiciary personnel.
*   **A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC (Code of Conduct for Court Personnel):** Violated by Almanoche's conduct.
*   *Re: Verified Complaint dated July 13, 2015 of Alfonso Umali, Jr. v. Justice Hernandez, 781 Phil. 375 (2016):*  Justifies the relaxation of the hearsay rule in administrative proceedings involving bribery.
*   *Atty. Pasok v. Diaz, 677 Phil. 520 (2011):*  Emphasizes the high ethical standards required in the judiciary.
*   *Judge Perez v. Roxas, 834 Phil. 163 (2018)* highlights the duty to preserve public faith in our courts
*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Buzon, 890 Phil. 367 (2020)* and *Judge Alano v. Sahi, 745 Phil. 385 (2014):* Analogous cases where dismissal was imposed for similar misconduct.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The relaxation of the hearsay rule, while justified, is a potential point of contention if Almanoche seeks further legal recourse. The line between permissible corroboration and impermissible reliance on hearsay could be debated.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of Almanoche, prioritizing the integrity of the judiciary and the need to maintain public trust. The case highlights the high ethical standards expected of court personnel and the potential consequences for even perceived breaches of these standards.
