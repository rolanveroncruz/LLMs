**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-17-3740 (Re: Habitual Tardiness of John B. Benedito)**

**Case Summary:** This Resolution clarifies the interpretation of a previous ruling suspending Clerk III John B. Benedito for habitual tardiness. The key issue is whether the 10-day suspension should be interpreted as calendar days or working days.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Suspension Penalty:** Benedito was previously suspended for ten (10) days without pay for habitual tardiness.
*   **Clarification Sought:** Benedito sought clarification on whether the suspension applied to calendar days or working days. He served the suspension based on working days.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court declares that the 10-day suspension refers to ten (10) *calendar days*.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   While the Court clarified the suspension applied to calendar days, Benedito had already served the equivalent time.
*   Initially, the OCA recommended deducting leave credits for days Benedito was absent under the mistaken belief he was still suspended. However, the Court disagreed.
*   **Consequences of Suspension:** Suspension creates a gap in service, impacts monetary benefits (including leave credits), and disqualifies the employee from promotions during the corresponding suspension period (citing 2017 RACCS, Rules 56 & 57).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Original Resolution:** The original resolution was silent on whether the suspension was to be served based on calendar or working days, leading to the confusion. *This highlights the importance of clarity in drafting disciplinary orders.*
*   **Reliance on Analogy:** The Court relied on analogy to *GSIS v. Velasco* for preventive suspension interpretation and labor cases for employee suspension interpretation. *The use of analogy could be challenged if the factual or legal contexts are substantially different.*
*   **"Good Faith" Defense:** The Court relied on *Wooden v. Civil Service Commission* to excuse Benedito's erroneous interpretation due to "honest mistake," *This raises the question of the standard for determining "honest mistake" and whether it will be consistently applied in similar cases.*

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (2017 RACCS), Rules 56 & 57:** Cited for implications of a suspension.
*   **GSIS v. Velasco:** Referenced for the application of calendar days in preventive suspension cases.
*   **Wooden v. Civil Service Commission:** Used as precedent to excuse Benedito's mistake due to good faith.
*   **Article 13 of the Civil Code (superseded by Executive Order 292) & Section 31 of Executive Order 292:** Cited by OCA regarding definition of 'year', 'month' and 'day', however, Court ruled by analogy and precedent instead of these references.

**Recommendations/Further Inquiry:**

*   For future disciplinary actions, ensure explicit language specifying whether suspension is to be served using calendar or working days.
*   Assess potential implications of applying the "honest mistake" standard in similar administrative cases. Analyze how similarly situated individuals will be treated.
*   Evaluate the strength of the analogies used from *GSIS v. Velasco* and labor cases to ensure their applicability.
