## Legal Document Summary: *Valino v. Vergara, et al.*, G.R. No. 180492 (2009)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Resolution on a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 challenging COMELEC Resolutions regarding a pre-proclamation case.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Elpidio B. Valino (losing mayoral candidate)
*   **Respondents:** Alvin P. Vergara (winning mayoral candidate), Tomas N. Joson III, Raul P. Mendoza, Atty. Harold A. Ramos (COMELEC Election Officer), and COMELEC.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Election Offense Allegation:** Valino filed a petition (SPC 07-152) with COMELEC alleging that Vergara, Joson, and Mendoza violated R.A. No. 9006 (Fair Election Act) by illegally displaying campaign materials, seeking the cancellation of Vergara's proclamation. This stems from a failure of the Cabanatuan COMELEC officer (Atty. Ramos) and local police to remove illegal campaign materials after Valino's complaints prior to the election.
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 8212 (Omnibus Resolution):** COMELEC *en banc* issued a resolution pursuant to Section 16 of R.A. No. 7166 declaring that certain pre-proclamation cases would *not* continue beyond June 30, 2007 (effectively dismissing them).  Valino's case (SPC 07-152) was *not* included in the list of cases slated to continue.
*   **Procedural Lapses by Valino:**
    *   Failed to timely file a Petition for Certiorari within 30 days from notice of Resolution No. 8212.  Instead, he filed a prohibited Motion for Reconsideration.
    *   Original complaint was not verified.
    *   Failed to follow Rule 34 of the 1993 COMELEC Rules of Procedure for prosecuting election offenses (e.g., unverified letter-complaints, failure to file a verified complaint with the COMELEC Law Department).
    *   Petition improperly sought annulment of proclamation instead of preliminary investigation and prosecution.

**COMELEC Rulings & Actions:**

*   COMELEC treated Valino's case as a pre-proclamation controversy and dismissed it via Resolution No. 8212, removing it from the active cases list.
*   COMELEC Second Division Order forwarded the case file to the Clerk of the COMELEC after Resolution 8212.

**Court Ruling:**

*   **Petition Dismissed.** The Supreme Court held that Valino's procedural errors were fatal.
*   Resolution No. 8212 had become final and executory due to Valino's failure to file a timely Petition for Certiorari.  Motion for Reconsideration was prohibited.
*   COMELEC did not commit grave abuse of discretion in treating the case as a pre-proclamation controversy and dismissing it.
*   SC acknowledged potential confusion caused by Resolution 8212 but still found no grave abuse of discretion by COMELEC.

**Key Legal Issues & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9006 (Fair Election Act):** Alleged violation related to illegal campaign materials.
*   **R.A. No. 7166, Section 16:** COMELEC's power to terminate pre-proclamation cases at the start of the term of office involved.
*   **1987 Constitution, Article IX-A, Section 7:** Certiorari to the Supreme Court from COMELEC decisions.
*   **Rules of Civil Procedure, Rules 64 & 65:** Procedure for filing petitions for certiorari.
*   **1993 COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 13, Section 1(d):** Prohibition on motions for reconsideration of *en banc* rulings (except election offenses).
*   **1993 COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 34:** Procedure for prosecuting election offenses.
*   **Omnibus Election Code, Section 243:** Issues that may be raised in a pre-proclamation controversy.

**Case Law Referenced:**

*   *Bautista v. COMELEC*, 460 Phil. 459 (2003): Motion for reconsideration of an en banc COMELEC ruling is prohibited.
*   *Laurel v. Presiding Judge, RTC-Manila, Br. 10*, G.R. No. 131778 (2000): Applied Rule 34 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.
*   *Patalinghug v. Commission on Elections*, G.R. No. 178767 (2008): Guidelines regarding remedies in pre-proclamation cases after COMELEC Omnibus Resolutions.
* Cipriano v. Commission on Elections, 479 Phil. 677, 691 (2004).
* Audi AG v. Mejia, G.R. No. 167533, July 27, 2007, 528 SCRA 378, 385.
* Zacate v. Commission on Elections, 405 Phil. 960, 972-973 (2001).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The primary ambiguity stems from the COMELEC's issuance of an omnibus resolution (Resolution No. 8212) listing cases that would *not* continue, rather than ruling on each case individually. This created confusion regarding proper procedure.
*   The court criticized Atty. Ramos' apparent failure to furnish a copy of Valino's complaint to the Director of the COMELEC Law Department, in possible dereliction of duty.

**Potential Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Atty. Ramos:** Possible administrative liability for failure to comply with COMELEC rules (failure to furnish a copy of the complaint). The Court directed COMELEC to investigate.
*   **Valino:** Time-barred from pursuing a pre-proclamation contest; however, election offenses prescribe in 4 years, so theoretically, he can revive his complaint following proper procedure. However, he needs to re-file his complaint to prosecute the election offense under Rule 34.
*   *None of the Respondents are held directly liable in this case, though their actions contributed to the improper procedure*

**Summary Judgment**

This case essentially reaffirms strict adherence to procedural rules in election law. It highlights the importance of timely and properly filing pleadings with the COMELEC, and the limited scope of pre-proclamation controversies. The case also touches upon the COMELEC's duty to ensure transparency and clarity in its rulings. The Court dismissed the case as the procedural requirements to appeal COMELEC's decision had not been met by the Petitioner.
