## Legal Document Summary: CESB v. CSC, G.R. No. 196890

**Nature of Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court in a petition for *certiorari* and prohibition under Rule 65, regarding the termination of a CESB Director III.

**Case Summary:** The CESB, represented by its Chairperson, Executive Director, and Deputy Executive Director, filed a petition challenging the CSC's decision that nullified the CESB Chairperson's memorandum terminating the services of Blesilda Lodevico, a Director III at CESB. The termination was based on OP MC 1 and its Implementing Guidelines. Lodevico appealed to the CSC, which ruled in her favor, stating that only the President could terminate a presidential appointee. The Supreme Court reversed the CSC's decision.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Office of the President Memorandum Circulars (MC 1 & MC 2):**  MC 1 declared all non-CES positions vacant. MC 2 extended the term of non-CESOs occupying CES positions until October 31, 2010, but subject to earlier termination.
*   **Administrative Code of 1987 (Book V, Title I, Subtitle A, Chapter 3, Section 12):**  Outlines powers and functions of the Civil Service Commission, including authority over civil service matters.
*   **Integrated Reorganization Plan (PD No. 1):** Establishes the Career Executive Service Board (CESB) as governing body, with mandate to promulgate rules, standards and procedures on selection, classification, compensation and career development of members of the CES.
*   **CESB Circular No. 2 Series of 2003:** Details requirements for membership in the CES, including CES eligibility and appointment to a CES rank.
*   **Appointment Status and Security of Tenure:** The Court clarified the distinction between CES eligibility and appointment to a CES rank for acquiring permanent status in the career executive service.
*   **Rule 65 vs. Rule 43 of the Rules of Court:** Addresses procedural issue of which petition should be filed

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Wrongful Termination (Potential Liability prior to SC Ruling):**  If the termination was deemed unlawful, CESB could be liable for back salaries and benefits.
*   **Procedural Error (Filed Rule 65 instead of Rule 43):** The SC acknowledged the procedural error but opted to relax the rules in the interest of justice. *Leyte IV Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. LEYECO IV Employees Union-ALU* (562 Phil. 743, 755 (2007)).
*   **Misinterpretation of CES Requirements:** The CSC misinterpreted the requirements for permanent status in CES.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **1987 Constitution, Article IX-B:** Establishes the Civil Service Commission.
*   **Administrative Code of 1987, Book V, Title I, Subtitle A, Chapter 2, Section 8:** Defines levels of positions in the career service.
*   **Administrative Code of 1987, Book V, Title I, Subtitle A, Chapter 5, Section 27:** Defines Employment Status
*   ***Eugenio v. CSC*, 312 Phil. 1145, 1155 (1995).:** The decisions of the CESB are expressly subject to the CSC's review on appeal

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "CES Position":** The distinction between occupying a "CES position" and being appointed to a "CES rank" proved crucial and was the core of the dispute.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, reversing the CSC's decision. It held that while Lodevico was a CES eligible, she was not appointed to a CES rank. Therefore, her appointment was temporary, and her termination under MC Nos. 1 and 2 was valid.
