## Legal Document Summary: *Pepsi Cola Products Phils., Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.* G.R. No. 122629

**Case Summary:**

This is a petition for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision which affirmed the RTC's order denying PCPPI's motion for postponement and declaring waiver of its right to present evidence in a collection case filed by private respondents, holders of unpaid "349" Pepsi crowns. The case stems from the failed "Pepsi Number Fever Promotion."

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Cause of Action:** Collection of sum of money and damages by unpaid holders of "349" Pepsi crowns.
*   **Procedural History:** Numerous postponements requested by PCPPI due to witness unavailability. RTC warned that further delays would be considered a waiver. PCPPI failed to present witnesses on a set date, leading to RTC's denial of postponement and declaration of waiver.
*   **RTC Order:** Denied PCPPI's oral motion for postponement and Motion for Reconsideration. Declared PCPPI waived the right to present evidence. Scheduled memoranda filing and considered the case submitted for decision.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC order, finding no grave abuse of discretion.

**Obligations:**

*   PCPPI had the obligation to present its evidence within the timeframe set by the court.
*   PCPPI counsel had a duty to manage schedules and ensure witness availability.
*   All parties are obligated to comply with court orders and deadlines.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential monetary liability for PCPPI to pay the private respondents the value of the winning crowns and damages, as determined by the RTC based on evidence already presented.

**Potential Risks:**

*   PCPPI's waiver of evidence presentation significantly prejudices its defense.
*   The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' decisions, making a reversal and successful defense highly unlikely.
*   Double costs will be added to PCPPI's burden.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Basis for the petition for review on certiorari.
*   **Rule 22, Section 4 of the Revised Rules of Court (now Rule 30, Section 3, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure):** Requires affidavit demonstrating materiality of evidence and due diligence in procuring it for a motion to postpone due to absence of evidence.
*   **Rule 15, Section 4 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Requires three-day notice for motions.
*   **Cases Cited:**
    *   *Presbitero v. Court of Appeals*, 217 SCRA 372 (1993): Motion for continuance is not a matter of right.
    *   *De Guzman v. Elbinias*, 172 SCRA 240 (1989): Discusses valid grounds for postponement (distinguished from this case).
    *   *Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. v. Genovea*, 116 SCRA 395 (1982): Reopening of case for reception of evidence (distinguished).
    *   *Sayson v. People*, 166 SCRA 680 (1988): Denied postponement due to lack of seasonable filing and supporting documentation.
    *  *Banogon v. Zerna, 154 SCRA 593 (1987): Lawyers have a responsibility to avoid filing meritless claims that add to the workload of the Judiciary.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "intransferrable in character" regarding the hearing schedule. PCPPI argued its witnesses had prior commitments in other courts. However, the RTC and CA interpreted it to mean PCPPI should have prioritized this case.
*   Materiality of witnesses' testimonies. PCPPI argued the materiality can only be appreciated after the testimonies, but the courts held PCPPI should have alleged and proved the materiality in its motion for postponement.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts, finding no grave abuse of discretion in denying PCPPI's motion for postponement and deeming its right to present evidence waived. PCPPI faces a high risk of liability due to the lack of presented evidence. Focus shifts to assessment of damages based on the private respondents' evidence. Further legal options for PCPPI are limited and may be subject to sanctions for frivolous appeals.
