## Legal Document Summary: *Luna, Jr. v. Cabales et al.* G.R. No. 173533 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing a Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruling in a recovery of possession case.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Martinez owned land partitioned between daughters Eustaquia and Martina.
*   Eustaquia's son, Ciriaco, fraudulently obtained a Free Patent (OCT No. 5028) over the *entire* property, including Martina's share.
*   Ciriaco's heirs subdivided the property and sold a 480 sq.m. lot (Lot 3040-F) to Petitioner Luna in 1975.
*   Luna obtained TCT No. T-5891 in 1993.
*   Luna filed a recovery of possession suit against Remedios Rosil (Martina's granddaughter) and others.
*   RTC ruled for Luna.
*   CA reversed, finding fraud in Ciriaco's title acquisition and that Luna was not a purchaser in good faith, ordering reconveyance to Remedios.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Fraudulent Title Acquisition:** Ciriaco fraudulently obtained OCT No. 5028 by including Martina's share. This is a critical finding with implications under the Property Registration Decree.
*   **Good Faith Purchaser:** Luna failed to prove he was a purchaser in good faith.  He had constructive notice of Remedios' possession and failed to investigate.  Relevant case law: *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals*, 387 Phil. 283 (2000).
*   **Reconveyance:** CA ordered reconveyance of Lot 3040-F from Luna to Remedios. This is based on the principle of constructive trust (Article 1456, Civil Code).
*   **Counterclaim:** The CA treated Remedios' counterclaim as a direct attack on Luna's title, negating the argument that it was a collateral attack prohibited by the Torrens system.  Relevant case law: *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals*.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Discrepancy in Area:** The Deed of Sale specifies 480 sq.m., while a later Affidavit of Confirmation indicates 557 sq.m. This discrepancy was not explained and could raise questions about the validity of the sale.
*   **Description of Property in Deed of Sale:** The description of the location states that the portion subject of sale shall be taken from the northern part southward with a measurement of forty (40) meters in length and twelve (12) meters in width. This is relevant if the land has changed shape over time.
*   **Laches:** The CA does not address whether Remedios' claim is barred by laches, given the significant delay between the initial fraudulent acquisition of the title and the counterclaim for reconveyance.
*   **Validity of Free Patent:** The case hinges on the validity of Ciriaco's Free Patent. Under Section 101 of the Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141), actions for the reversion of fraudulently acquired public lands have specific limitations.
*   **Effect of the Original Partition:** The partition between Eustaquia and Martina established separate ownership, raising the issue of whether Ciriaco's Free Patent could validly cover Martina's share.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Property Registration Decree (PD 1529):** Relates to the Torrens system and the indefeasibility of title. Section 32, specifically mentioned by the Petitioner, regarding the period to review or attack a decree of registration.
*   **Civil Code (Republic Act No. 386):** Article 1456 regarding constructive trusts.
*   **Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141):** Section 101 regarding actions for reversion of fraudulently acquired public lands.

**Case Law:**

*   *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals, 387 Phil. 283 (2000):* Addresses good faith purchaser status and the nature of a counterclaim as a direct attack on title.

**Legal Advice:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision. The petitioner (Luna) lost.
