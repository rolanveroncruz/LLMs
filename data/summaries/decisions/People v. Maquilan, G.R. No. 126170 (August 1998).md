## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Maquilan*, G.R. No. 126170

**Nature:** Resolution regarding accused-appellant's (Maquilan) motion to withdraw her appeal after conviction for drug pushing (R.A. No. 6425, as amended) and subsequent release via a writ of *habeas corpus*.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Withdrawal of Appeal Denied:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied Maquilan's motion to withdraw her appeal despite the Solicitor General's lack of objection.
*   ***Habeas Corpus* Invalid:** The SC determined that the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig City, Branch 71, erroneously granted the writ of *habeas corpus* and ordered Maquilan's release because her appeal was still pending. The RTC lacked jurisdiction as the conviction was not yet final.
*   **Misrepresentation:** Maquilan misrepresented to the Pasig RTC that her conviction was final, and Rachel D. Ruelo, Superintendent IV of the Correctional Institute for Women, did not object to her petition, misleading the court.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Rearrest Order:** The Bureau of Corrections is directed to rearrest Maquilan within 60 days.
*   **Show Cause Order:** Maquilan, her counsel (Editha C. Pio), and Ruelo are required to show cause why they should not be held in contempt for misrepresenting the status of the criminal case.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Contempt Charges:** Maquilan, Pio, and Ruelo face potential contempt charges for misleading the RTC, a serious matter potentially leading to fines or imprisonment.
*   **Unlawful Interference:** The SC views the release of Maquilan as unlawful interference with its proceedings, potentially impacting other similar cases.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act, as amended):** The statute under which Maquilan was originally convicted.
*   **R.A. No. 7659:** Amended R.A. 6425, and the Pasig Court mistakenly used it in its ruling. The Court in this Resolution found that this ruling was not legally sound, and that the lower court had acted outside its jurisdiction.
*   ***People v. Mendoza*, 93 Phil. 581 (1953):** Cited by the Solicitor General regarding the permissibility of withdrawing an appeal before the appellee's brief is filed, although SC ultimately denied the motion to withdraw in this case.
*   ***People v. De Lara*, 236 SCRA 291, 299:** Used by the Pasig RTC to determine the penalty imposed for the amount of marijuana confiscated from Maquilan.
*   ***People v. Simon*, 234 SCRA 555:** Cited by the Pasig RTC for applying the amended law (R.A. No. 7659) retroactively.
*   ***People v. Bacang*, 260 SCRA 44 (1996):** Analogous case cited by the SC, involving withdrawal of appeal and presidential pardon, highlighting the principle that pardon cannot be granted while an appeal is pending.
*   ***People v. Salle, Jr.*, 250 SCRA 581, 592 (1996):** Quoted in *Bacang*, further clarifying the prohibition on granting pardon during the pendency of an appeal.
*   ***Ordo√±ez v. Vinarao*, 239 SCRA 114, 115:** Used by the Pasig RTC in it's ruling.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

* The Pasig RTC's basis for granting *habeas corpus* is contentious, as the SC clearly states that it had no jurisdiction because the case was on appeal. The reliance on drug weight to apply RA 7659 retroactively is also disputed by the SC, as it highlights the error in Pasig RTCs assessment. The retrospective application of R.A. No. 7659, while generally accepted, can be complex and may be subject to further debate depending on the specific facts. The lack of objection by the Superintendent of the Correctional Institute for Women may raise questions of dereliction of duty.
