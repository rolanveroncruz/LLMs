## Legal Document Summary: *Gosiaco v. Ching and Casta* (G.R. No. 173807, April 16, 2009)

**Nature:** Supreme Court Decision regarding liability for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (B.P. 22, the Bouncing Checks Law).

**Key Facts:**

*   Jaime Gosiaco (Petitioner) loaned P8,000,000.00 to ASB Holdings, Inc. (ASB).
*   Leticia Ching (Respondent), as ASB's Business Development Operation Group Manager, issued two DBS checks on behalf of ASB to Gosiaco.
*   The checks were dishonored due to a stop payment order and insufficient funds.
*   Gosiaco filed a criminal complaint for violation of B.P. 22 against Ching and Edwin Casta (another ASB officer, not significantly involved).
*   The MTC acquitted Ching of criminal liability but held her civilly liable.
*   The RTC reversed the MTC decision regarding civil liability, exonerating Ching and stating the obligation fell solely on ASB.
*   The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision.

**Issues:**

1.  Is a corporate officer who signs a bouncing check civilly liable under B.P. 22, even if acquitted of criminal liability?
2.  Can a corporation be impleaded in a B.P. 22 case?
3.  Is there a basis to pierce the corporate veil of ASB to hold its President, Luke Roxas, liable?

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court **denied** the petition, upholding the acquittal of Ching and the inability to implead ASB in the B.P. 22 criminal case. However, the Court **granted** Gosiaco the right to pursue an independent civil action against ASB for the amount of the subject checks, exempting him from paying filing fees (for equitable reasons) and the action from prescription counted from the finality of this decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **B.P. 22, Section 1:** The person signing a check on behalf of a corporation that bounces can be held liable under the Act.
*   **Civil Liability of Corporate Officers:**  Generally, a corporate officer who issues a bouncing corporate check can only be held civilly liable *when convicted* of the B.P. 22 violation. Citing *Bautista v. Auto Plus Traders Inc.* (G.R. No. 166405, 6 August 2008), the Court follows the precedent that the civil liability of a corporate officer in a B.P. Blg. 22 case is extinguished with the criminal liability.
*   **Implication of Rule 111, Section 1(b) of the Rules on Criminal Procedure:** While the Rules require the joint trial of the criminal and civil liability in B.P. 22 cases, the Court clarified that it only applies to the *signatory's* liability and not the corporation's separate civil obligation, the action against the corporation may be pursued independently.
*   **Jurisdiction Over Juridical Persons in B.P. 22:**  Nowhere in B.P. Blg. 22 provides for juridical persons to be impleaded.
*   **Petitioner's Right to Sue:**  Petitioner is permitted to pursue a separate civil action against ASB for the debt, without being barred by prescription counting from the date of the checks' issuance.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Ching's Criminal and Civil Liabilities:**  Ching is exonerated from criminal and associated civil liability under B.P. 22 due to her acquittal.
*   **ASB's Civil Liability:** ASB remains civilly liable for the underlying debt evidenced by the dishonored checks.
*   **Risk of Double Recovery:** The Court acknowledged the risk of a plaintiff recovering the amount of the check in both the B.P. 22 case and a civil action against the corporation and referred the matter to the Committee on Rules to formulate guidelines to prevent that possibility.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (B.P. 22):**  The Bouncing Checks Law.
*   **Rule 111, Section 1(b), Rules on Criminal Procedure:**  Governing the institution of criminal and civil actions related to B.P. 22.
*   **Lozano v. Martinez, Nos. L-63419:** Rationale of B.P. 22
*   **People v. Laggui, G.R. Nos. 76262-63:** Rationale of B.P. 22
*   **Llamado v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 99032:** Corporate officer liability under B.P. 22
*   **Bautista v. Auto Plus Traders Inc., G.R. No. 166405:**  Extinguishment of civil liability with criminal acquittal in B.P. 22 cases.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 103:** Subsidiary civil liability does not apply to special laws.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Relationship between B.P. 22 and Civil Action:**  The decision clarified that the compulsory joinder of civil and criminal actions in B.P. 22 cases applies only to the individual signatory's liability, *not* the corporation's. This clarifies the relationship between Rule 111 Section 1(b) and the creditor's right to independently pursue ASB for the debt.

**Recommendations/Next Steps:**

*   **File a Civil Action against ASB:** Gosiaco should promptly file a separate civil action against ASB to recover the P8,112,000.00.
*   **Monitor Rule Revisions:** Monitor any changes to the Rules of Procedure arising from the Court's referral to the Committee on Revision of the Rules regarding preventing double recovery in B.P. 22 cases.
*   **Consider Piercing the Corporate Veil (if applicable):** Assess whether circumstances exist that warrant piercing the corporate veil in the civil action, if assets of the corporation are insufficient to pay the judgement. The petition does not seem to contain sufficient facts to do this, and the Court of Appeals ruled there was no basis, however this should be reviewed again in the civil action.

This summary provides the core legal arguments and outcomes of the case. Further research into the cited case law and B.P. 22 jurisprudence will be necessary for effective legal action.
