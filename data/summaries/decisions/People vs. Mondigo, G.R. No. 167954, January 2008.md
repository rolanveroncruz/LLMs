**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Mondigo*, G.R. No. 167954**

**Overview:**

This is an appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision convicting Perlito Mondigo of Murder and Frustrated Murder. The Supreme Court (SC) modified the CA decision, finding Mondigo guilty of Homicide (for the death of Damaso Delima) and Frustrated Murder (for the injuries to Anthony Delima).  The case stems from a drinking spree that escalated into violence, where Mondigo attacked Damaso and Anthony with a bolo. Mondigo claimed self-defense, which was rejected by the lower courts and the Supreme Court.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Homicide (Damaso Delima):** Mondigo is found guilty of Homicide under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code. He is obligated to serve a sentence of 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 14 years and 8 months of *reclusion temporal*.
*   **Frustrated Murder (Anthony Delima):** Mondigo is found guilty of Frustrated Murder. He is obligated to serve a sentence of 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 14 years and 8 months of *reclusion temporal*.
*   **Civil Liabilities:** Mondigo is obligated to pay the heirs of Damaso Delima civil indemnity of P50,000 and moral damages of P50,000.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Mondigo faces imprisonment for both Homicide and Frustrated Murder.
*   **Financial Liability:** Mondigo is liable for civil indemnity and moral damages.
*   **Appeal:**  The possibility of further appeal seems exhausted given this decision from Supreme Court.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Article 249 (Homicide), Article 14(16) (Treachery), Article 15 (Intoxication), Article 263 par. 4 (Serious Physical Injuries).
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied in determining the sentence for Homicide.
*   **Self-Defense:** The court relies on *People v. Ignacio*, 337 Phil. 173 (1997), and *People v. Mindac*, G.R. No. 83030, 14 December 1992, 216 SCRA 558, regarding the burden of proof when self-defense is invoked.
*   **Treachery:** Defined using Article 14(16) of the RPC, and is cited regarding how how the criminal act commenced, developed and ended per People v. Mationg, 407 Phil. 771 (2001).
*   **Intoxication:** The court references I Reyes, The Revised Penal Code 465, 467 (14th ed.), regarding Intoxication.
*   **Civil Indemnity/Moral Damages:** The court references *People v. Delim*, 444 Phil. 430 (2003); *People v. Cabacan*, 436 Phil. 397 (2002), regarding these topics.
*   **People v. Mateo:** Used when transferring case to the Court of Appeals.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Treachery in Damaso's Killing:** The key point of contention was whether the killing of Damaso was attended by treachery. The Supreme Court found insufficient evidence to establish how the attack on Damaso commenced, overturning the lower courts' finding of Murder and convicting Mondigo of the lesser offense of Homicide. The suddenness of attack alone is insufficient to prove treachery.
*   **Intoxication as Mitigating Circumstance:** The trial court's application of intoxication as a mitigating circumstance was overturned due to lack of sufficient evidence demonstrating the degree of intoxication and its impact on Mondigo's mental faculties, citing Reyes's treatise on the RPC.

**Potential Issues for Further Review/Consideration (Likely Exhausted):**

*   **Factual Findings:** The Supreme Court gave considerable weight to the factual findings of the lower courts regarding the credibility of witnesses. Challenging these findings at this stage would be difficult.

**Summary of Ruling Impact**

Appellant convicted of homicide and frustrated murder.
