## Legal Document Summary: *Noell Whessoe, Inc. v. Independent Testing Consultants, Inc., et al.* G.R. No. 199851 (2018)

**Subject:** Solidary liability for unpaid subcontractor obligations; applicability of Art. 1729 of the Civil Code; entitlement to moral damages by a corporation.

**Key Issue:** Whether Noell Whessoe, Inc. (NWI) is solidarily liable with Liquigaz Philippines Corp. (Liquigaz) and Petrotech Systems, Inc. (Petrotech) to Independent Testing Consultants, Inc. (ITC) for unpaid testing fees, despite lacking a direct contract with ITC, and whether NWI is entitled to moral damages.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court ruled that while Article 1729 of the Civil Code can impose solidary liability on an owner, contractor, and subcontractor for the benefit of suppliers (like ITC), full payment by the contractor to the subcontractor serves as a valid defense. Since NWI's principal (Whessoe UK) had already paid Petrotech in full, NWI is absolved from solidary liability. The Court also denied NWI's claim for moral damages as a corporation is incapable of experiencing mental anguish.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 1729, Civil Code:** Establishes a direct cause of action for those furnishing labor or materials against the owner, up to the amount owed by the owner to the contractor at the time the claim is made, absent full payment to a subcontractor.
*   **Solidary Liability:** If applicable, allows ITC to pursue the full amount owed from Liquigaz, NWI, or Petrotech individually.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Initially:** Trial and Appellate Courts found NWI solidarily liable with Liquigaz and Petrotech for the debt to ITC based on being the general contractor.
*   **Ultimately:** Supreme Court absolved NWI from liability due to proof of full payment to its sub-contractor Petrotech. Any remaining obligations to ITC rests solely with Liquigaz and Petrotech.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Determining NWI's Role:** The core dispute centered on whether NWI acted as a contractor or merely a construction manager for Whessoe UK. The Court found sufficient evidence that they were acting as the general contractor, effectively one entity for the purpose of the project.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **JL Investment and Development, Inc. v. Tendon Philippines, Inc., 541 Phil. 82 (2007):** Clarifies the application of Article 1729 as an exception to privity of contract, protecting suppliers.
*   **Mambulao Lumber v. Philippine National Bank, 130 Phil. 366 (1968) & ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 361 Phil. 499 (1999):** Pertaining to a corporation's entitlement to moral damages.  ABS-CBN clarifies that Mambulao Lumber's statement on a corporation's right to damages is mere *obiter dictum*.  General rule is corporations cannot receive moral damages.
*   **Pioneer International v. Hon. Guadiz, 561 Phil. 688 (2007)**: Examines communications and conduct to determine if distinct corporate entities were actually acting in concert.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 1729:** Basis for imposing solidary liability on owners and contractors for subcontractors' debts to suppliers.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1311:** Contractual privity principle, subject to exceptions.

**Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The contract between Whessoe UK and NWI (Conditions of Contract for Supply of Professional, Technical and Management Services) was argued by NWI to be simply one of site management.  The Court concluded NWI had taken on all project responsibilities.

**Impact/Takeaway:** This case clarifies that while Article 1729 provides a remedy for suppliers, it is not absolute. Proof of full payment by a contractor to its subcontractor is a valid defense. Additionally, the court reiterates the general rule that corporations are not entitled to moral damages.
