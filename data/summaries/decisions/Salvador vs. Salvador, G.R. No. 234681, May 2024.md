**Case Summary: *Salvador v. Salvador*, G.R. No. 234681 (May 29, 2024)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision affirming an RTC decision that declared Franklin Salvador a legitimate son of Anatolio Salvador, thus entitling his heirs to a share in Anatolio's estate. The original case was for Declaration of Nullity of Documents, Reconveyance of Property, Partition, Recovery of Possession, Quieting of Title, and Damages.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Legitimacy of Franklin Salvador:** The SC affirmed the CA and RTC's finding that Franklin is a legitimate son of Anatolio and Rosario, based on Franklin's Certificate of Live Birth (delayed registration but deemed *prima facie* evidence under *Baldos v. Court of Appeals*, 638 Phil. 601 (2010)), a letter indicating Anatolio's death date, and a family bible entry. The SC distinguished *Ara v. Pizarro*, 805 Phil. 759 (2017), as the registration of birth occurred before the filing of the complaint and during Rosario's lifetime.
*   **Collateral Attack on Legitimacy:** Juanito's attempt to challenge Franklin's legitimacy in this action (aimed at preventing the nullification of documents and reconveyance) constitutes a prohibited collateral attack on Franklin's legal status. Reference to *Tison v. Court of Appeals*, 342 Phil. 550 (1997).
*   **Applicable Law:** Because Anatolio died in 1944, the Spanish Civil Code applies in determining heirship.
*   **Heirship Shares:** Under the Spanish Civil Code, Juanito and Franklin are entitled to two-thirds of Anatolio's estate in equal shares. Rosario, as the surviving spouse, was entitled to the usufruct of the remaining one-third. Upon Rosario's death, the full ownership of the estate vested in Juanito and Franklin.
*   **Co-Ownership and Partition:**  The SC acknowledged that the parties are co-owners but ruled that the order for Reconveyance may only proceed after the partition of properties.
*    **Reconveyance:** The Court ordered reconveyance of Franklin's share (inherited by his heirs) in Anatolio's estate.
*   **Remand for Partition and Joinder of Indispensable Parties:** SC remanded the case to the RTC to implement partition and ordered the lower court to determine the necessity of impleading other indispensable parties (possible other heirs of Anatolio, Rosario, and Celedonio) before the RTC proceeds with the Partition and reconveyance. Reference to *Reyes v. Spouses Garcia*, G.R. No. 225159, March 21, 2022.

**Obligations:**

*   **RTC:** To implement partition of the subject properties and to determine/implead any other indispensable parties for the purpose of determining their rights prior to Partition and Reconveyance.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Other Indispensable Parties:** The court noted that there might be other heirs, including children from Rosario's second marriage, whose rights were not considered. The RTC must determine and implead them.
*   **Nature of Properties:**  The court raised concerns about the true source of the properties subject to reconveyance. Did the properties belong to the conjugal partnership of Anatolio and Rosario? If so, the property must be divided in accordance with the Spanish Civil Code.
*   **Partition Complications:** Implementation of partition could be complex due to the nature and location of the properties, which may be subject to existing alienations (as alleged by Maria et al.).
*   **Unclear Successional Rights:** The decision is unclear if all Franklinâ€™s Children (Alexis, Jeffrey, Anthony, and Hyacinth) are from Maria. This could create future disputes on successional rights amongst the heirs of Franklin.
