## Legal Document Summary: Remollo v. Garcia (A.M. No. P-98-1276)

**Nature:** Administrative case against Atty. Thelma A. Garcia, Clerk of Court and Ex Officio Provincial Sheriff, for misfeasance, bias, ignorance of law, and usurpation of judicial functions.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Failure to Execute Sheriff's Final Deed of Sale:** Respondent failed to execute the Sheriff's Final Deed of Sale despite the expiration of the redemption period (Sec. 35, Rule 39, Rules of Court, now Sec. 33) and a Court of Appeals decision (CA-G.R. SP-34649) mandating such execution.
*   **Conflict of Interest/Bias:** The refusal stemmed from the fact that the judgment debtors were her nephews and nieces, suggesting bias in their favor. The Court cites the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees (RA 6713), prohibiting undue favors to relatives.
*   **Ministerial Duty:** The Court reiterates that a sheriff's duty to execute the deed after the redemption period is ministerial, not discretionary, citing the Manual for Clerks of Court. Respondent overstepped her bounds when she issued a Certificate of Redemption after the lapse of the redemption period.
*   **Impact of Retirement:** Although Respondent retired before the case was finalized, the Court was able to order that her retirement benefits be partially forfeited to the extent of the fine imposed.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 35 (now Sec. 33):** Defines the sheriff's duty regarding the execution of a deed of conveyance.
*   **RA 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees):** Addresses conflicts of interest and prohibits preferential treatment of relatives.
*   **Padilla v. Arabia (A.M. No. 93-774):** Similar case of dismissal for failure to enforce writs of execution.
*   **Evangelista v. Penserga (A.M. No. P-92-766):** Clarifies the ministerial nature of a sheriff's duties.
*   **Morales v. CFI of Cavite, Br. V (No. L-47125):** Relates to ministerial duty for executing certificate of redemption.
*   **Ponce de Leon v. Atty. Thelma A. Garcia (A.M. No. P-91-544):** Prior administrative case against respondent.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The Deed of Sale executed on March 5, 1997, contained a waiver that may be considered problematic by the Court as this was not ordered by the Court of Appeals.
*   **Damages:** While the primary focus is administrative liability, the delay and frustration caused to the complainant suggest a potential separate civil action for damages, even if the final deed was executed.
*   The fact that not all of the heirs of the judgment creditors opposed the extension of the redemption period might have been a point of contention, but the court clearly took the view that the sheriff's duty to the complainant and his sister was unaffected by the other heirs' position.
*   **Scope of Waiver:** the actual language and validity of the waiver of the other heirs' rights in favor of the judgment debtors may raise further legal issues.

**Outcome:** Atty. Garcia found guilty of gross misconduct and a fine of P30,000.00 was ordered to be deducted from her retirement benefits.
