**Legal Document Summary: *Antipolo Properties, Inc. v. Cesar Nuyda* (G.R. No. 171832)**

**Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's ruling in favor of respondent Cesar Nuyda for specific performance and damages.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Kasunduan (Feb 14, 1991):** Agreement between Antipolo Properties (API) and MUMI (settlers' association) for relocation of MUMI members to allow API to develop the land. API obligated to provide resettlement area, allot lots, and pay disturbance compensation.
*   **Kasunduan (June 7, 1991):** Agreement between API and respondent Nuyda. API recognized Nuyda as a MUMI member, awarded him 2,880 sq m lot in the resettlement area, and guaranteed disturbance compensation in exchange for vacating the property.
*   **API's Obligations:** Provide Nuyda with a 2,880 sq m lot in the resettlement area, pay disturbance compensation (₱22,875), and pay damages for destroyed plants/trees (₱200,000).

**Liabilities:**

*   **API:** Liable for specific performance of the June 7, 1991 Kasunduan, including lot allocation, disturbance compensation, and damages.

**Potential Risks for API:**

*   **Enforcement of Contractual Obligations:** API is legally bound to fulfill the terms of the Kasunduan. The courts have emphasized the principle that contracts are the law between the parties.
*   **Estoppel:** API is estopped from denying Nuyda's membership in MUMI and his entitlement to benefits due to their express acknowledgment in the June 7, 1991 Kasunduan. (Art. 1431, Civil Code)
*   **Damages:** Liable for additional damages due to breach of contract.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Riser Airconditioning Services Corporation v. Confield Construction Development Corporation, G.R. No. 143273, September 20, 2004:** Reinforces the principle that contracts are the law between the contracting parties.
*   **Barredo v. Leaño, G.R. No. 156627, June 4, 2004:** Emphasizes the literal interpretation of clear contractual terms.
*   **Article 1431 of the Civil Code:** Deals with estoppel, preventing API from contradicting its previous acknowledgment of Nuyda's rights.
*   **Article 1371 of the Civil Code:** Emphasizes the consideration of contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the parties in judging their intentions, in this case, the fact that API granted the same contractual benefits to another caretaker.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Kasapi" (Member):** API argued that the term "kasapi" in the Feb 14, 1991 Kasunduan should be interpreted to exclude caretakers, limiting the benefits to only those who occupied the land in the concept of an owner. The Court rejected this interpretation based on API's subsequent conduct and the principles of estoppel.
*   **Rubber-Stamp Signature:** API argued that the president's signature on the June 7, 1991 agreement was a mere rubber stamp, invalidating the contract. The court dismissed this claim, noting the existence of the original signed copy.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied API's petition, affirming the CA and RTC rulings. API is bound by the terms of the June 7, 1991 Kasunduan and is liable for specific performance and damages. API's attempt to reinterpret the definition of "kasapi" to exclude Nuyda was unsuccessful due to the principle of estoppel and their own conduct.
