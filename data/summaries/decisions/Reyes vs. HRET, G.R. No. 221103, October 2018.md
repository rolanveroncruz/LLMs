## Legal Document Summary: *Regina Ongsiako Reyes v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal* (G.R. No. 221103, October 16, 2018)

**Case Summary:**

Petitioner Reyes challenged the constitutionality of several provisions of the 2015 Revised Rules of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET). The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the petition, upholding the HRET rules with some clarification on timing of election protests/quo warranto cases given amendments to the rules.

**Key Provisions Challenged:**

1.  **Rule 6(a): Quorum Requirement** - Requires the presence of at least one Justice of the Supreme Court and four members of the Tribunal (legislators) to constitute a quorum.
2.  **Rule 6, in relation to Rule 69: Voting Requirements** - Rules regarding the number of votes required for a decision, specifically concerning instances of inhibition and the impact on quorum.
3.  **Rule 15, paragraph 2, in relation to Rule 17: Requisites of a Member & Timing of Protests** - Defines when someone is considered a Member of the House (valid proclamation, oath, assumption of office) and sets the timeline for filing election protests (15 days from June 30 or assumption of office, whichever is later).

**Petitioner's Arguments:**

*   **Quorum Requirement:**
    *   Unconstitutional violation of equal protection by giving Justices undue power/veto.
    *   Ambiguous composition of the 4 HRET member requirement; not necessarily only legislators.
*   **Voting Requirements:**  Ambiguous regarding the majority required in cases of inhibition, potentially allowing decisions with minimal votes.
*   **Requisites of a Member & Timing of Protests:**
    *   Unconstitutionally expands COMELEC jurisdiction by allowing it to determine valid proclamation/oath until assumption of office.
    *   Shifting filing deadline from date of proclamation to actual assumption of office creates uncertainty.

**HRET/Supreme Court Rationale & Ruling:**

*   **Quorum Requirement:**
    *   Constitutional, balances power between Judicial and Legislative branches as intended by framers (citing *Tañada and Macapagal v. Cuenca*, 103 Phil. 1051 (1957) and *Angara vs. Electoral Commission*, 63 Phil. 139).
    *   Ensures presence of both Judicial and Legislative representatives. Does not violate Equal Protection as there is a rational basis for treating SC Justices and legislators differently; to guarantee impartiality.
*   **Voting Requirements:**  Petitioner's interpretation is incorrect; inhibiting members are not counted for quorum purposes.
*   **Requisites of a Member & Timing of Protests:**
    *   HRET is still the sole judge, not COMELEC.
    *   **However**, the Court took judicial notice that HRET Resolution No. 16, Series of 2018, has since amended Rules 17 and 18, to clarify & address ambiguity regarding filing deadlines, moving it back to 15 days from June 30th (if proclaimed by then), or 15 days from proclamation date if proclaimed after June 30th. This amendment effectively moots the petitioner's concerns as to timing of election protest/quo warranto cases.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses (Pre-Amendment):**

*   **Before Amendment:** The initial version of Rule 17 regarding the deadline for filing election protests posed a risk. *The ambiguity regarding when the assumption of office date was/would happen created challenges.*
    *   The shifting deadline based on "actual assumption of office" lacked clarity and could be manipulated, potentially disenfranchising those seeking to challenge elections.

**Statutory/Case Law References:**

*   Section 17, Article VI, 1987 Constitution
*   Tañada and Macapagal v. Cuenca, 103 Phil. 1051 (1957)
*   Angara vs. Electoral Commission, 63 Phil. 139
*   HRET Resolution No. 16, Series of 2018 (amending Rules 17 & 18)
*   Section 1, Article III, 1987 Constitution

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the challenged HRET rules. The only potential area of concern, the uncertain deadline for filing election protests, appears to have been addressed by the HRET's subsequent amendment. This amendment is key, and counsel should ensure it is accurately applied in any relevant current or future HRET proceedings.
