## Legal Document Summary: Avanceña et al. vs. COA

**Case:** *Nelson R. Avanceña, et al. vs. Commission on Audit and Ma. Corazon S. Gomez* (G.R. No. 254337, June 18, 2024)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64 assailing COA Decision No. 2020-341 which affirmed with modification COA RO IV-B Decision No. 2018-29 and Notices of Disallowance (NDs) Nos. 17-001-100(14), 17-003-100-(14) to 17-008-100-(14) and 17-011-100-(14).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Disallowance:**  PHP 8,191,695.83 disallowed due to procurement of office supplies, food, and other items in 2014 by the Municipality of Dr. Jose P. Rizal, Palawan.
*   **Petitioners:**  Officials and employees of the Municipality (Avanceña et al.), acting as members and secretariat of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC).
*   **Grounds for Disallowance:** Violations of RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act) and its 2009 Revised IRR, including:
    *   Non-submission of required documents.
    *   Purchase requests containing brand names (Section 18, RA 9184).
    *   Splitting of contracts to evade public bidding (Section 54.1, 2009 Revised IRR).
    *   Inappropriate resort to Small Value Procurement (SVP) for readily available goods (Sections 53.9 & 52, 2009 Revised IRR).
    *   Lack of DBM-Procurement Service certification on non-availability.
*   **BAC Resolutions:** BAC Resolutions No. 2014-01-03, 2014-01-04, 2014-01-13, and 2014-04-34 recommended SVP for various municipal events, with a threshold of PHP 100,000.00 each.
* The Court absolved the Bids and Awards Committee Secretariat from any liability considering that their functions are purely administrative and ministerial in nature, as they primarily provide administrative support to the BAC

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **BAC Responsibility:** RA 9184 & IRR place responsibility on the BAC to ensure compliance with procurement standards. The BAC members are liable for patently disregarding mandatory procurement procedures, as well as payees for the disallowed amounts.
*   **Palarca, Tolentino, De Guzman, Calamba, and Lobaton Liabilities**:  The court affirmed the COA findings that Palarca, Tolentino, De Guzman, Calamba, and Lobaton are liable for their patent disregard of mandatory procurement procedures, as well as the payees for the disallowed amounts.
*   **Return of Amounts:** The case is REMANDED to the Commission on Audit for the computation of the amounts to be returned by Henry V. Palarca, Nida B. Tolentino, Teodora M. De Guzman, Jerry V. Calamba, and Rodel B. Lobaton
*   **Good Faith Defense:**  Denied based on badges of bad faith in the subject procurement transactions: (a) Palarca et al. failed to justify the resort to Small Value Procurement; (b) there was splitting of government contracts to evade competitive public bidding; (c) and Palarca et al. deliberately failed to observe the guidelines and procedures under Republic Act No. 9184 and its Revised IRR
* Solidary liability of government officials who approved or took part in the illegal expenditure of public funds, pursuant to Section 43 of Book VI of the 1987 Administrative Code, does not necessarily equate to the total amount of the expenditure

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Splitting of Contracts:**  Multiple procurements of similar items from the same supplier, each under PHP 100,000.00, create a risk of splitting contracts, potentially requiring public bidding. This is a major point of contention.
*   **Broadly Worded BAC Resolutions:**  The BAC resolutions, approving SVP for unspecified "goods," were used for multiple transactions which skirted the proper procurement procedures mandated by RA 9184
*   **"Time Constraint" Justification:**  Reliance on "time constraints" to justify SVP may be challenged as insufficient reason to bypass competitive bidding.  It must be demonstrable *why* the time constraint existed and if proper planning could have avoided it.
*   **Determination of Amounts:**  The court deemed it proper to order the return of these amounts following the guidelines laid down in Torreta v. COA[98] and echoed in Bodo v. COA, and remanded the case for the COA to determine the amounts to be returned.
*   **Application of *Quantum Meruit*:** The determination of liabilities is one that the COA is technically equipped to undertake. As a final note, Palarca et al, are reminded that they are officials and employees of the Government tasked to protect its interest.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9184 & 2009 Revised IRR:** Government Procurement Reform Act and its Implementing Rules. Critical for all procurement activities.
*   **Section 18, RA 9184:** Prohibits specification of brand names in purchase requests.
*   **Section 54.1, 2009 Revised IRR:** Prohibits splitting of contracts.
*   **Sections 53.9 & 52, 2009 Revised IRR:** Pertains to the proper use of SVP.
*   **Administrative Code of 1987, Book VI, Chapter 5, Section 43:**  Liability for Illegal Expenditures.
*   **Government Procurement Policy Board Resolution No. 09-2009** Guidelines for Shopping and Small Value Procurement.
*   ***PNP-CIDG v. Villafuerte, 840 Phil. 243 (2018)*:**  BAC Secretariat absolved of liability for purely administrative functions.
*   ***In Re: Contracts with Artes International, Inc., 838 Phil. 355 (2018):***  Court held that the following elements constitute the act of splitting of contract in procurement projects
*   ***Madera et al. v. COA, 882 Phil. 744 (2020):*** Public officers are liable for disallowances only when their participation is attended by negligence, bad faith, or malice.
*   ***Patadon v. COA, G.R. 218347, March 15, 2022 [Per J. Inting, En Banc].*** all approving officers must discharge their duties pertinent to the disbursement process with the diligence of a good father of the family.
*   ***Torreta v. COA, 889 Phil. 1119 (2020) [Per J. Gaerlan, En Banc]:***  If a Notice of Disallowance is upheld, civil liability of approving officers and the civil liability for the disallowed amount may be reduced by the amounts due the recipient based on the application of the principle of quantum meruit on a case to case basis.

**Overall Assessment:**

The COA’s disallowance appears justified based on the evidence presented. The BAC members failed to adhere to proper procurement procedures, and their reliance on "time constraints" is unlikely to be successful. The risk of splitting contracts is a significant issue. However, the remand for the COA to compute the liabilities may benefit the client by allowing for *quantum meruit* reductions in the ultimately disallowed amount. Focus arguments on demonstrating good faith, absence of malice, and attempts to comply with the law despite challenging circumstances.
