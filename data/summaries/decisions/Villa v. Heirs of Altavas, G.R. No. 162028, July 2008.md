## Legal Document Summary: *Dr. Lorna Villa vs. Heirs of Enrique Altavas*, G.R. No. 162028, July 14, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a CA decision affirming RTC orders that dismissed Petitioner's appeal from an MCTC ejectment ruling.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Ejectment Action Upheld:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision upholding the MCTC's ruling that ordered Dr. Villa to vacate a portion of Lot No. 2817 (erroneously referred to Lot 2816 initially), owned by the Heirs of Enrique Altavas, and to pay compensation.

*   **Procedural Default:** Dr. Villa's appeal to the RTC was dismissed for failure to timely file an appeal memorandum as required by Rule 40, Section 7(b) of the Rules of Court. The SC upheld the CA's finding that the RTC did not gravely abuse its discretion in doing so. The court reiterated that the rules of procedure are mandatory and that the negligence of counsel binds the client. *Enriquez v. Court of Appeals*, 444 Phil. 419 (2003) and Gonzales v. Gonzales, G.R. No. 151376, February 22, 2006, 483 SCRA 57.

*   **Ownership and Possession:** The Altavas heirs established ownership through Original Certificates of Title, RO-4326 and RO-4327. Villaâ€™s lease with Virginia Bermejo was deemed invalid as Virginia was neither the owner nor administrator of the property, and thus lacked the right to lease it.

*   **Factual Findings Binding:** The SC affirmed the lower courts' factual findings, reiterating that these are generally binding and conclusive, absent specific exceptions (none of which were present in this case).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Dr. Villa:** Obligation to vacate the property (Lot 2817) and pay compensation for unlawful possession from the date of demand.
*   **No obligation against Dr. Villa to pay attorney's fees:** Only Roxas and Bermejo were originally ordered by the MCTC to pay attorney's fees, but both of their respective appeals were dismissed by the RTC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Continued Trespass/Eviction:** Dr. Villa faces continued liability for unlawful possession and potential eviction.
*   **Enforcement of Judgment:** The Altavas heirs can now enforce the MCTC's judgment for ejectment and compensation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 40, Section 7(b), Rules of Court:** Failure to file appeal memorandum as grounds for dismissal. *Enriquez v. Court of Appeals*, 444 Phil. 419 (2003) and Gonzales v. Gonzales, G.R. No. 151376, February 22, 2006, 483 SCRA 57.
*   **Sandejas v. Ignacio, Jr., G.R. No. 155033, December 19, 2007, 541 SCRA 61, 74:** Established principle that the trial court's findings of fact, especially when affirmed by the CA, are generally binding and conclusive upon this Court
*   **Original Certificates of Title Nos. RO-4326 and RO-4327:** Presented by the Altavas' heirs as evidence of ownership and right to possess.
*   **Moneytrend Lending Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 165580, February 20, 2006, 482 SCRA 705, 714.:** Reglementary periods are strictly applied.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Misidentification of Lot Number:** The initial misidentification of Lot No. 2816 in the Complaint, later corrected to Lot No. 2817 by the MCTC and CA, could have been grounds for appeal had it been properly raised. However, this issue was not raised by the Respondents and, therefore, was considered by the Court to be Lot 2817.

**Overall Assessment:**

The SC ruling is unfavorable to Dr. Villa. Her failure to comply with procedural rules (timely filing of appeal memorandum) proved fatal, and the factual findings of the lower courts, supported by documentary evidence (Titles), were upheld. The lease contract was deemed invalid due to the lessor's lack of ownership. The remaining path for Dr. Villa is now very limited.
