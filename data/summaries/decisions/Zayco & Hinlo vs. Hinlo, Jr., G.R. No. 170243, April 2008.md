Okay, here's a legal summary of the document provided:

**Case:** *Nancy H. Zayco and Remo Hinlo vs. Atty. Jesus V. Hinlo, Jr.* G.R. No. 170243 (2008)

**Subject Matter:** Appealability of an RTC order revoking the appointment of co-administrators of an estate and appointing a new administrator. Timeliness of appeal.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Background:** Enrique Hinlo died intestate. Petitioners (Zayco and Hinlo) were appointed co-administrators of his estate. Respondent (Hinlo, Jr.), a grandson of Enrique, petitioned for his own appointment as administrator and for the removal of the petitioners.

*   **RTC Orders:** The RTC revoked the petitioners' appointment and appointed the respondent as administrator (Order of July 23, 2002).  The RTC denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration (Order of July 23, 2003). The RTC subsequently denied the notice of appeal and the record of appeal based on the orders being interlocutory and not subject to appeal, and that the filings were out of time (Order of January 5, 2004).

*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals dismissed the petitioners' petition for certiorari and mandamus, affirming the RTC's denial of the appeal.

*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversing the CA and RTC. The SC held that the order appointing an administrator is a *final* and *appealable* order. The Supreme Court cited *Testate Estate of Manuel v. Biascan* (2000) in its decision.

*   **Timeliness:** The SC found that the petitioners' notice of appeal and record on appeal were timely filed under Rule 41, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, and according to the ruling of *Neypes v. CA* (2005), the 30 day period is reckoned from the order denying the Motion for Reconsideration.

**Obligations:**

*   **Trial Court Obligation:** The RTC is obligated to approve the notice of appeal and record on appeal and forward them to the Court of Appeals.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Potential liability for breach of fiduciary duty:** The original co-administrators could have been liable for any breach of duty in their roles, however this would not be decided in this case.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Further Litigation:** While this resolves the procedural issue of appealability, further litigation regarding the administration of the estate is possible, particularly regarding the suitability and actions of the appointed administrator.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 41, Section 3, Rules of Court:**  Governs the period for filing appeals, specifically the requirement for a record on appeal in certain cases.
*   **Neypes v. CA, G.R. No. 141524, 469 SCRA 633 (2005):** Establishes that the period to appeal is counted from the receipt of the order denying the motion for reconsideration or new trial.
*   **Testate Estate of Manuel v. Biascan, 401 Phil. 49 (2000):**  Clarifies that an order appointing an administrator is a final, appealable order.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The primary contention was whether the order removing the co-administrators and appointing a new administrator was a final, appealable order or merely interlocutory. The RTC's initial stance was that it was interlocutory, which the SC overturned. The timeliness of the appeal hinged on this determination.

**Overall Summary for Legal Professional:**

This case concerns a procedural issue regarding the appeal of an RTC order removing estate co-administrators and appointing a new administrator. The SC held that such an order is final and appealable. The Court reversed the CA and RTC, finding the appeal to be timely under the *Neypes v. CA* doctrine regarding the counting of the appeal period. This ruling essentially reopens the appeal process, allowing the merits of the RTC's decision to remove the original co-administrators to be heard by the Court of Appeals. The key takeaway is the reaffirmation of the appealability of orders appointing estate administrators, which is a fundamental point of law in estate proceedings.
