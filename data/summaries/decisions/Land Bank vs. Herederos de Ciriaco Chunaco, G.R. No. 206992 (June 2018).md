**Case Summary: *Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Herederos De Ciriaco Chunaco Distileria, Inc.* G.R. No. 206992, June 11, 2018**

**Facts:**

*   Respondent owned 22.587 hectares of land in Albay, covered by CARP.
*   Respondent voluntarily offered the land for sale to the Republic.
*   LBP valued the land at P957,991.30, which Respondent rejected.
*   PARAD initially determined just compensation at P4,455,349.00 (P195,410.07/hectare).
*   LBP filed a Motion for Reconsideration before the PARAD, which was denied. LBP then filed Petition for Judicial Determination of Just Compensation with the RTC-SAC.
*   PARAD declared its decision final and executory and issued Writ of Execution, leading LBP to file Petition for Certiorari with DARAB, arguing for the validity of their remedy based on their Rules. DARAB denied the petition, citing that the petition for determination of just compensation in the RTC-SAC was filed beyond the fifteen (15)-day reglamentary period.
*   CA affirmed the DARAB decision, holding that the PARAD's decision was final and executory and the 'fresh period rule' (Neypes) doesn't apply to administrative proceedings.

**Issue:** Whether a "fresh 15-day period" is available to file a petition for judicial determination of just compensation with the Special Agrarian Court (SAC) after denial of a Motion for Reconsideration of the PARAD's decision.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court **granted** the petition, reversing the CA decision.
*   The Court held that the Petition for Judicial Determination of Just Compensation was timely filed based on the following.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Vests original and exclusive jurisdiction for just compensation determination with Special Agrarian Courts (SAC), not administrative agencies like DAR.
*   **Article 1144 of the Civil Code:** Provides a ten (10)-year prescriptive period for obligations created by law. Court applied this to the filing of petitions for judicial determination of just compensation with SAC.
*    No prescriptive period for filing the petition for judicial determination of just compensation, since the legislature can recall that power and that DAR has no authority to qualify that.
*   **DARAB Rules, Section 11:**  Prescribed a 15-day period to appeal PARAD's valuation to the SAC.  The Supreme Court declared this invalid, as it curtails the SAC's jurisdiction.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Land Bank of the Philippines:** Risk of paying higher just compensation as determined by the SAC if the SAC favors the higher valuation.
*   **Herederos De Ciriaco Chunaco Distileria, Inc.:** Risk of not being able to collect just compensation if they don't pursue the RTC-SAC action diligently. Risk that SAC may uphold LBP's initial valuation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657, Sections 56 & 57:** Confer jurisdiction over just compensation to the SAC.
*   **DARAB Rules, Section 11:** Invalid prescriptive period.
*   **Export Processing Zone Authority v. Judge Dulay, 233 Phil. 313, 326 (1987):**  Eminent domain, valuation of property is essentially a judicial function.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Dalauta, G.R. No. 190004, August 8, 2017:**  Key case invalidating the 15-day prescriptive period in the DARAB Rules.
*   **Neypes v. Court of Appeals, 506 Phil. 613 (2005):** Ruled the fresh fifteen-day period under is not applicable in administrative proceedings.
*   **Article 1144 of the Civil Code:** Action must be brought within ten years from the time right of action accrues.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Sps. Montalvan, et al., 689 Phil. 641 (2012).**
*   **Coderias v. Estate of Juan Chioco, 712 Phil. 354, 370 (2013).**
*   **Pajolino v. Tajala, 636 Phil. 313 (2010).**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The DARAB Rules' attempt to regulate the timeline for actions before the SAC.
*   The application of the "fresh period rule" (from *Neypes*) in administrative proceedings, specifically concerning judicial determination of just compensation.

**Potential Risks/Further Analysis:**

*   LBP needs to actively defend its valuation in the RTC-SAC proceeding to avoid paying an inflated price.
*   The Respondent needs to pursue the action in the RTC-SAC within ten (10) years from receiving the notice of coverage of CARP.
*   The final determination of just compensation is now solely in the jurisdiction of the RTC-SAC. The PARAD's initial determination is non-binding, though can be used as evidence.
