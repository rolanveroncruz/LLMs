**Case:** Rickmers Marine Agency Phils., Inc. vs. Edmund R. San Jose, G.R. No. 220949, July 23, 2018.

**Summary:**

This case involves a seafarer, Edmund R. San Jose, claiming total and permanent disability benefits from his employer, Rickmers Marine Agency Phils., Inc., due to retinal detachment in his left eye (rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy, lattice degeneration, myopia, OS).  The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision awarding San Jose total and permanent disability benefits, but modified it by deleting the awards for attorney's fees, unexpired salary, and financial assistance.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **POEA-SEC:** The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC) governs the employment relationship and liabilities. Section 20(B) outlines compensation and benefits for injury or illness.
*   **Medical Examination:** Seafarer is obligated to undergo a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three (3) days of repatriation.
*   **Company-Designated Physician's Duty:** The company-designated physician has a duty to issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer's disability grading within 120 days from repatriation, extendable to 240 days with justifiable reason. Failure to do so results in the seafarer's disability being deemed total and permanent.
*   **Disability Compensation:** Compensation for permanent disability is determined by the POEA-SEC schedule of benefits in Section 32.
*   **Sickness Allowance:** Upon sign-off for medical treatment, the seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage until declared fit to work or the degree of permanent disability has been assessed, not exceeding 120 days (Section 20(B)(3) of the 2000 POEA-SEC).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Employers' Liability:** Rickmers Marine Agency Phils., Inc. and Global Management Limited are solidarily liable for the total permanent disability compensation of US$ 60,000.
*   **No liability for attorney's fees, unearned wages or financial assistance:** SC found no basis for those awards under the circumstances.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to Comply with Timeframes:** Delaying or failing to issue a final medical assessment within the 120/240-day timeframe can automatically result in a finding of total and permanent disability, regardless of the actual degree of disability.
*   **Ambiguous Medical Assessments:** A medical assessment that is unclear or does not provide a disability grading can be challenged.
*   **Litigation Costs:** While attorney's fees were denied in this specific case, the risk of incurring legal costs for defending against disability claims remains a risk.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 192(c)(1) of the Labor Code:** Defines temporary total disability lasting continuously for more than 120 days as total and permanent.
*   **Section 2, Rule X of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation:** Period of Entitlement.
*   **Section 20(B) of the POEA-SEC:** Outlines employers' responsibilities for seafarer's injury or illness.
*   **Section 32-A (18) of the 2010 POEA-SEC** lists conditions which qualify as occupational diseases
*   **Vergara v. Hammonia (important case cited):** Clarifies the rules regarding the 120/240-day period and the company-designated physician's obligations.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The precise definition of "justifiable reason" for extending the 120-day period to 240 days is not explicitly defined in the POEA-SEC and can be subject to interpretation, leading to disputes.

**Conclusion:**

The SC reiterated the strict adherence to the timelines stipulated in the POEA-SEC regarding medical assessments by company-designated physicians.  Failure to comply can lead to the automatic granting of total and permanent disability benefits. However, awards beyond the disability compensation itself require clear legal or factual bases and are not automatically granted. This case highlights the importance of diligent monitoring and compliance with medical evaluation timelines in seafarer disability claims.
