## Legal Document Summary: *Filipinas Life Assurance Co. v. Pedroso*

**Case:** *Filipinas Life Assurance Company (now Ayala Life Assurance, Inc.) vs. Clemente N. Pedroso, et al.* G.R. No. 159489, February 4, 2008

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding Filipinas Life jointly and severally liable with its agent, Renato Valle, for investments solicited by Valle and other employees (Apetrior & Alcantara) that were not returned to the respondents (Pedroso & Palacio).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision holding Filipinas Life jointly and severally liable.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Agency Relationship:** Valle was deemed an agent of Filipinas Life.
*   **Scope of Authority (Apparent Authority):** While the investment scheme may have been *ultra vires*, Filipinas Life was held to have clothed Valle with apparent authority to solicit investments through confirmation of the promotions by Alcantara (Administrative Assistant) and Apetrior (Branch Manager)
*   **Ratification:** Filipinas Life, through Alcantara and Apetrior, expressly or impliedly ratified Valle’s acts by confirming Valle's authority to solicit investments and allowing the deposits in the company's bank account.
*   **Liability:** Filipinas Life was held solidarily liable with Valle, Apetrior, and Alcantara under Article 1911 of the Civil Code, which provides that principals are liable with their agents when the principal allows the agent to act as if they have full powers.
*   **Duty of Diligence:** Although third parties usually have a duty to ascertain the agent's authority, the respondents exercised sufficient diligence by confirming Valle's representations with Filipinas Life’s representatives, Alcantara and Apetrior.

**Liabilities:**

*   Filipinas Life is jointly and severally liable to respondents Pedroso and Palacio for the unreturned investments.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Liability for Acts of Agents:** The case highlights the risk of principals being held liable for the actions of their agents, even when those actions are beyond the agent's explicit authority, if apparent authority is created or the actions are ratified.
*   **Internal Control Deficiencies:** The confirmation by employees of transactions outside their scope of authority exposes a weakness in the internal controls of Filipinas Life, posing a reputational and financial risk.
*   **Estoppel:** The doctrine of estoppel prevents Filipinas Life from denying Valle's authority after representing him as having such authority to third parties.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 1868:** Defines the contract of agency.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1911:** Establishes solidary liability of the principal with the agent when the principal allows the agent to act as though he had full powers.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1910:** Discusses the obligations of the principal and the agent's actions exceeding their power.
*   ***Lopez, et al. v. Hon. Alvendia, et al.*, 120 Phil. 1424 (1964):** Principal is responsible for acts of agent done within the scope of their authority.
*   ***BA Finance Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 94566, July 3, 1992:** Agent becomes personally liable for damages when they exceed their authority.
*   ***Manila Memorial Park Cemetery, Inc. v. Linsangan*, G.R. No. 151319, November 22, 2004:** Defines ratification in agency.
*   ***Prudential Bank v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 108957, June 14, 1993:** "He who does a thing by an agent is considered as doing it himself."

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of "apparent authority" can be subjective and depends on the specific facts and circumstances. The confirmation by Apetrior and Alcantara, though lower-level employees, was sufficient to create apparent authority in the eyes of the Court.
*   The line between authorized and unauthorized actions can be blurred, especially when an agent benefits the principal through actions later deemed outside the scope of their authority.
