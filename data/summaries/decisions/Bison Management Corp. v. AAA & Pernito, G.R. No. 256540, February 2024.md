**Case:** *Bison Management Corporation vs. AAA and Dale P. Pernito* (G.R. No. 256540, February 14, 2024)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review under Rule 45 assailing the CA decision affirming the NLRC's ruling of illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Parties:**
    *   Bison Management Corporation (Bison): Recruitment agency, Petitioner.
    *   AAA: OFW, Respondent, terminated after testing HIV-positive in Saudi Arabia.
    *   Dale P. Pernito (Pernito): OFW, Respondent, allegedly terminated without cause in Saudi Arabia.
    *   Saraya Al Jazerah Contracting Est.: Foreign recruitment agency.

*   **AAA's Termination:** Terminated due to HIV-positive status, based on Saudi Arabian law. Bison argues this is permissible under the principle of *pacta sunt servanda* and the Agreement on Labor Cooperation with Saudi Arabia.

*   **Pernito's Termination:** Alleged voluntary resignation disputed.  Employer provided a self-serving email. NLRC and CA ruled that Bison failed to prove voluntary resignation.

*   **Procedural History:**
    *   Labor Arbiter dismissed illegal dismissal claim but granted AAA unpaid salary, vacation leave, and attorney's fees.
    *   NLRC reversed, finding illegal dismissal for both AAA and Pernito and awarding damages and attorney's fees.
    *   CA affirmed the NLRC.

**Supreme Court Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the Petition and affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals.

**Key Legal Issues and Analysis:**

1.  **Illegal Dismissal:** The SC upheld the NLRC and CA's finding of illegal dismissal for both respondents.

2.  **Pernito's Termination:**  Bison failed to prove voluntary resignation. The email presented as evidence was considered self-serving and lacking in detail.

3.  **AAA's Termination and Choice of Law:**

    *   **Lex Loci Contractus:** SC applied the principle of *lex loci contractus*, holding that Philippine law governs the employment contract.
    *   **Pacta Sunt Servanda:** The court rejected Bison's argument based on *pacta sunt servanda* related to Saudi Arabian law regarding HIV-positive workers.  The SC emphasized that agreements cannot override Philippine law and public policy.
    *   **Failure to Prove Foreign Law:** Bison failed to properly prove Saudi Arabian law by not complying with Rule 132, Sections 24 and 25 of the Revised Rules of Court. Thus the doctrine of processual presumption applies.
    *   **Conflict with Philippine Law:** The purported Saudi Arabian law conflicts with Republic Act No. 11166 (Philippine HIV and AIDS Policy Act), which prohibits discrimination based on HIV status.  Specifically, Section 49(a) prohibits termination based solely or partially on HIV status.  Termination on the ground of a positive HIV test result is not legal under Philippine law.
    *   **Pakistan International Airlines Corp. v. Ople Doctrine:** The Supreme Court reiterated the principle that public interest overrides contractual stipulations in overseas employment.
    *   Even if disease may be a ground for termination under Article 299 of the Labor Code, as amended and renumbered, Bison has conceded that HIV positive is not yet an illness/disease.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Bison Management Corporation, Saraja Al Jazirah Contracting Est., and Belen M. Alhumayed are jointly and severally liable for monetary awards, including salaries for unexpired contracts, unpaid salaries, vacation leave pay, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees for both AAA and Pernito.
*   Awards earn legal interest of 6% per annum from the finality of the decision until fully satisfied.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Joint and Several Liability:**  Bison and the other parties are jointly and severally liable, meaning each can be held responsible for the entire judgment.
*   **Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with the monetary awards can lead to execution of judgment and potential seizure of assets.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article XIII, Section 3:** Protection to labor.
*   **Republic Act No. 11166 (Philippine HIV and AIDS Policy Act):** Prohibits discrimination based on HIV status. Section 49(a) is specifically relevant.
*   **Industrial Personnel & Management Services, Inc. v. De Vera (782 Phil. 230 (2016)):**  Doctrine of *lex loci contractus*.
*   **Pakistan International Airlines Corp. v. Ople (268 Phil. 92 (1990)):** Public interest overrides contractual stipulations.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 132, Sections 24 and 25:** Proof of foreign law.
*   **Labor Code, Article 299:** Disease as a ground for termination.
*   **Princess Talent Center Production, Inc. v. Masagca, 829 Phil. 381 (2018):**  Constitutional guarantee of security of tenure extends to Filipino overseas contract workers.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application and interpretation of the Agreement on Labor Cooperation with Saudi Arabia, specifically regarding health requirements and communicable diseases, are contentious as the agreement may allow the termination of HIV positive OFWs. However, the court held that such agreement can not override Philippine law and public policy.
*   The self-serving email purporting Pernito's voluntary resignation was contentious.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the protection of Filipino workers' rights, particularly against discrimination based on HIV status and wrongful termination, and affirmed the *lex loci contractus* principle, prioritizing Philippine law over foreign laws that conflict with public policy. The court found the employer liable for illegal dismissal and associated damages.
