**Case Summary: *Oligario Salas v. Aboitiz One, Inc., and Sabin Aboitiz***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 178236, June 27, 2008 (578 Phil. 915)

**Parties:**
*   Petitioner: Oligario Salas (Employee)
*   Respondents: Aboitiz One, Inc., and Sabin Aboitiz (Employer)

**Key Issue:** Legality of employee's (Salas) termination based on (1) gross negligence in monitoring inventory (Quickbox) levels, (2) tampering with company records (Bin Card), and (3) willful breach of trust.

**Court Ruling (Supreme Court):** Reversed the CA decision, ruling the termination illegal. Ordered reinstatement of Salas without loss of seniority rights and payment of backwages, but limited the backwages due to Salas' partial fault.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Employer's Position:** Aboitiz asserted that Salas was terminated for just cause (gross negligence and willful breach of trust) after running out of Large Quickbox and tampering with the Bin Card. They argued that Salas' position as Material Controller warranted a high level of trust, and that the stockout negatively impacted business.
*   **Employee's Position:** Salas claimed illegal dismissal, seeking reinstatement and backwages. He argued that he made requisitions and follow-ups, negating gross negligence. He also requested retirement or resignation as alternatives.
*   **Labor Arbiter:** Initially upheld the validity of the dismissal, agreeing that Salas was remiss in his duties and the termination was justified.
*   **National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC):** Reversed the Labor Arbiter, finding no gross negligence but finding Salas guilty of negligence and tampering. Ordered separation pay instead of reinstatement, denying backwages due to strained relations.
*   **Court of Appeals (CA):** Reversed the NLRC, siding with Aboitiz and finding three grounds for dismissal: (1) serious misconduct (tampering records - Article 282 (a) of the Labor Code), (2) gross and habitual neglect (Article 282 (b) of the Labor Code), and (3) willful breach of trust (Article 282 (c) of the Labor Code).

**Supreme Court Analysis:**

1.  **Procedural Issues:** Addressed and dismissed Aboitiz's claims of procedural defects in Salas's petition. The Court emphasized resolving cases on merits over technicalities (citing *Torres v. Specialized Packaging Development Corporation*).

2.  **Negligence:** Found Salas not guilty of gross negligence. He made requisitions and follow-ups. While he failed to promptly inform his supervisor, this did not amount to gross neglect justifying dismissal.

3.  **Willful Breach of Trust:** Found that Salas's position was not one of high confidentiality that would warrant removal for loss of trust. The tampering wasn't proven to be a cover-up (lacking *substantial evidence*). The loss of trust must be *willful*, *intentional*, *knowing*, and *purposeful*, which Aboitiz failed to prove. *Manila Memorial Park Cemetery, Inc. v. Panado, G.R. No. 167118, June 15, 2006* defines the concept of "trust and confidence".

4.  **Serious Misconduct:** Rejecting CA's ruling, Salas' dismissal cannot be validated on the grounds of serious misconduct regarding failure to account for unused accountable forms amounting to P57,850.00 because it was raised only after Salas' dismissal.

5.  **Past Offenses:** Ruled that past offenses (suspensions) were unrelated to the current infraction and could not be used as additional justification for dismissal (*La Carlota Planters Association, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, 358 Phil. 732, 739 (1998)*). Penalizing him again for the past offense is also prohibited.

6.  **Backwages:** Limited the award of backwages due to Salas's failure to promptly inform his superior (non-delivery).

**Relevant Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 282:** Just Causes for Termination by Employer (specifically (a) serious misconduct, (b) gross and habitual neglect, (c) fraud or willful breach of trust).
*   **Labor Code, Article 279:** Reinstatement and backwages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** The case highlights the employer's heavy burden of proving *just cause* and *due process* for termination. *Substantial evidence* is needed for demonstrating both gross negligence and willful breach of trust.
*   **After-the-Fact Justifications:** Attempting to justify dismissal with reasons discovered *after* the termination decision is problematic.
*   **Limited Backwages:** The limitation on backwages due to Salas's minor fault creates ambiguity regarding the standard for *partial* liability in illegal dismissal cases. This could be appealed on the basis of the "whole injury" principle.
* **Lack of substancial proof of the cover-up of negligence** The employer failed to present more than their mere assertions of Salas's intentions.

*   *Panday v. NLRC, G.R. No. 67664, May 20, 1992, 209 SCRA 122, 125-126* (Definition of Position of Trust and Confidence)

* *PLDT v. National Labor Relations Commission, 362 Phil. 352 (1999).* (Sustained the award of backwages in favor of an employee who was found not to be entirely faultless, but only from the date of the NLRC's promulgation of the decision)
