**Case Summary: CIR v. Enron Subic Power Corporation (G.R. No. 166387)**

**Holding:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision annulling the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's (CIR) formal assessment notice against Enron Subic Power Corporation (Enron) for deficiency income tax for the taxable year 1996. The assessment was deemed void because the notice failed to state the legal and factual bases for the assessment, violating Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) and Section 3.1.4 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 12-99.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Section 228 NIRC and RR No. 12-99, Section 3.1.4:** Mandate that a taxpayer must be informed *in writing* of the law and the facts on which a tax assessment is based. The formal letter of demand and assessment notice must state these bases, otherwise, the assessment is void.  The Court emphasized that the use of "shall" makes this requirement mandatory.
*   **Due Process:** The Court cited the constitutional right to due process as underpinning the requirement for informing taxpayers of the bases of an assessment.
*   **Preferential Tax Rate:** Enron, as a registered freeport enterprise with the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority, was entitled to a 5% preferential tax rate under RA 7227.

**Liabilities:**

*   The original assessment was for P2,880,817.25 in deficiency income tax for 1996. This was cancelled due to procedural defects.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Invalid Assessment:**  Failure to explicitly state the factual and legal bases of a tax assessment in the formal assessment notice renders the assessment void. Preliminary notices, five-day letters, and audit working papers *cannot* substitute for this mandatory requirement.
*   **Procedural Compliance:** Strict adherence to Section 228 of the NIRC and RR No. 12-99 is critical for valid tax assessments.
*   **Abuse of Authority:** Arbitrary tax collection, even in the name of the government's need for revenue, is unlawful.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Compagnie Financiere Sucres et Denrees v. CIR:** Reiterates the deference given to the expertise of the CTA, especially when affirmed by the CA, unless there's an abuse of authority.
*   **CIR v. Reyes:**  Highlights the distinction between the *issuance* of a notice and the *content* of that notice. Issuance alone does not guarantee compliance with the requirement to inform the taxpayer of the assessment's legal and factual basis.
*   **Reyes v. Almanzor, et al.:** Emphasizes that while taxes are the lifeblood of the government, their collection must be lawful and not arbitrary.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The CIR's argument that pre-assessment communications and audit working papers "substantially complied" with the requirements of Section 228 was rejected.  The Court made it clear that *explicitly stating* the legal and factual bases in the *formal assessment notice* is non-negotiable.
