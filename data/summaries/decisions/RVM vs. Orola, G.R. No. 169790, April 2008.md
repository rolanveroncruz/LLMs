## Legal Document Summary: *Congregation of the Religious of the Virgin Mary v. Emilio Q. Orola, et al.* (G.R. No. 169790)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA decision that modified the RTC decision in a case for specific performance or rescission with damages.

**Facts:**

*   Respondents (Orola heirs) and Petitioner (RVM) entered into a contract for the sale of land. A contract to sell dated June 2, 1999 was presented in evidence pegging the total consideration of the property at P5,555,000.00 with 10% of the total consideration payable upon the execution of the contract.
*   RVM paid a 10% down payment. Respondents executed an extrajudicial settlement of the estate and transferred title to their names.
*   Respondents attempted to finalize the sale and receive the balance, but RVM refused, claiming they couldn't pay for two years.
*   Respondents filed suit for specific performance or rescission.

**Lower Court Rulings:**

*   **RTC:** Ruled there was a perfected contract of sale and granted rescission, forfeiting the down payment to respondents, and awarding exemplary damages and attorney's fees.
*   **CA:** Set aside the RTC decision and ordered specific performance, requiring RVM to pay the balance (P4,999,500.00) with 6% interest per annum from June 7, 2000, and respondents to deliver title and execute necessary documents.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract of Sale:** Found to be perfected, creating reciprocal obligations to transfer property and pay the purchase price.
*   **Payment of Balance:** RVM is obligated to pay the remaining balance of P4,999,500.00.
*   **Interest:** RVM ordered to pay interest at 6% per annum from June 7, 2000, until the obligation is fully satisfied.
*   **Transfer of Title:** Respondents are obligated to deliver the title and execute necessary documents upon RVM's full compliance.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **RVM's Liability for Interest:** The primary risk for RVM is the accruing interest on the unpaid balance, escalating their financial exposure.
*   **Respondents' Obligation to Transfer Title:** Respondents risk non-compliance if RVM fails to pay, potentially leading to further litigation.
*   **Breach of Contract:** RVM has already breached the contract by failing to pay the balance, triggering the remedies available to Respondents.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1191 Civil Code:** Remedy of rescission in reciprocal obligations (breach). The Court found the CA misapplied Art. 1383 and 1384 as this case arises from a breach under Art. 1191.
*   **Art. 1381 Civil Code:** Rescissible contracts based on lesion, fraud of creditors etc. Subsidiary action that cannot be invoked where other legal means exist. Not applicable in this case.
*   **Art. 1383 & 1384 Civil Code:** Conditions for rescission as a subsidiary remedy. Inapplicable as the Court views this as breach of reciprocal obligation under Art. 1191.
*   **Art. 2210 Civil Code:** Interest may be awarded upon damages for breach of contract.
*   ***Universal Food Corporation v. CA* (G.R. No. L-29155):**  Distinction between rescission for breach of contract (Art. 1191) vs. rescission for lesion (Art. 1381).
*   **Asturias Sugar Central v. Pure Cane Molasses Co., 60 Phil. 255 (1934); Borromeo v. Franco, 5 Phil. 49 (1905):** Contracts of sale create correlative duties to deliver property and pay the price.
*   **Art. 1193 Civil Code:** Reference to the nature of the agreement even with a stipulated period for payment.
*   **Laperal v. Solid Homes, Inc., G.R. No. 130913, June 12, 2005:** Affirms that damages are awarded in either case of fulfillment or rescission of the obligation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **2-Year Payment Period:** The claimed 2-year period for RVM to pay the balance is contentious and not clearly established in the written documents. The Court found this claim unsubstantiated and moot.
*   **"Most Equitable Solution":** RVM argued that the imposition of interest was not "equitable" without requiring respondents to pay rentals. The Court rejected this argument, stating the law is clear on damages for breach.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   Petition DENIED. The CA decision is AFFIRMED. The Court upholds the order for specific performance and payment of the balance with 6% interest from June 7, 2000, until fully satisfied. The court emphasized RVM's breach of contract and the corresponding entitlement of respondents to damages under Art. 1191.

**Legal Advice Considerations:**

*   RVM's primary option is to comply with the Court's decision to avoid further accrual of interest and potential enforcement actions.
*   While the CA ruling initially focused on a subsidiary rescission remedy, the Supreme Court clarified that the case is rooted in RVM's breach of a reciprocal obligation under Art. 1191.
*   Challenging the interest rate may be a limited option, but likely unsuccessful given the clear breach of contract by RVM.
