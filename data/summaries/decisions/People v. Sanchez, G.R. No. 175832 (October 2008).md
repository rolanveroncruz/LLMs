## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Sanchez*, G.R. No. 175832

**Case Overview:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) and acquitted Accused-Appellant Salvador Sanchez y Espiritu of violating Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act) due to the prosecution's failure to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The case involved a buy-bust operation.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Illegal sale of 0.02 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu), a violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** The case hinges on the validity of the buy-bust operation.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The SC found a significant break in the chain of custody of the seized evidence. Specifically, the prosecution failed to adequately establish the handling of the seized drugs:
    *   From the time of seizure by the poseur-buyer (SPO2 Sevilla).
    *   To its turnover to the desk officer and then to the investigator.
    *   To the submission of the evidence to the PNP Crime Laboratory.
    *   After chemical analysis by the forensic chemist.
*   **Section 21, R.A. 9165 (Chain of Custody Requirements):**
    *   Crucially, the SC found non-compliance with the mandatory requirements of Section 21, paragraph 1, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, which requires immediate physical inventory and photography of the seized drugs in the presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official, all of whom must sign the inventory.
    *   No evidence demonstrated that these steps occurred immediately after seizure.
*   **Marking of Evidence:** While physical inventory and photography have specific venue rules based on warrant/warrantless seizures, the *marking* of the seized items (initials and signature of the arresting officer) should be done immediately upon confiscation, in the presence of the violator.
*   **Presumption of Innocence:** The court emphasized the paramount importance of the constitutional presumption of innocence, which the prosecution failed to overcome.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court held that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties by police officers was negated due to the procedural lapses in handling the evidence.
*   **Corpus Delicti:** The prosecution failed to prove the *corpus delicti* beyond a reasonable doubt due to the broken chain of custody and non-compliance with Section 21, R.A. 9165.
*   **Evidence Stipulation:** The stipulation regarding the Forensic Chemist's testimony was narrowly construed, only applying to handling within the laboratory, not pre- or post-laboratory handling.

**Case Law Referenced:**

*   *People v. Tan*
*   *People v. Jocson*
*   *People v. Villanueva*
*   *People v. Del Mundo*
*   *People v. Kimura*

*   *People v. Santos*
*   *People v. Ca√±ete*
*   *Suson v. People*

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Procedural Lapses:** The primary risk is the police's failure to adhere strictly to the procedural safeguards outlined in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165. The court highlights the importance of immediate inventory and photography with the required witnesses.
*   **Evidence Tampering/Planting:** The broken chain of custody creates a risk that the evidence presented at trial was not the same evidence seized from the accused, raising the possibility of tampering or planting.
*   **Reliance on Witness Credibility:** The lower court's reliance on SPO2 Sevilla's prior history as a witness (rather than the merits of his testimony in this specific case) was deemed a violation of due process.
*   **Lack of Justification for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution failed to provide justifiable reasons for the non-compliance with Section 21, further weakening their case.

**Conclusion:**

The SC acquitted Sanchez, reinforcing the importance of strict adherence to the procedural requirements of R.A. No. 9165 in drug cases to safeguard the rights of the accused and maintain the integrity of the evidence. This case emphasizes the prosecution's burden to prove an unbroken chain of custody and meticulously follow Section 21's mandated steps. The decision serves as a cautionary tale for law enforcement regarding drug enforcement operations.
