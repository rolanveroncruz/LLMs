## Legal Document Summary: *People vs. De la Cruz and Martinez*, G.R. No. 173308

**Case Overview:** This is a review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Elmer De la Cruz and Tranquilino Martinez for kidnapping for ransom under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code. The Supreme Court (SC) affirms the conviction but modifies the penalty due to Republic Act No. 9346 (prohibiting the death penalty).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Crime:** Kidnapping for ransom of a minor, Aaron Dennis Ong.
*   **Accused:** Elmer De la Cruz (family driver), Tranquilino Martinez, Aldrin Tano (state witness), Romeo Dano (at large), Rex Tarnate (deceased during trial).
*   **Facts:** De la Cruz, the driver, conspired with others to kidnap Ong.  He facilitated the kidnapping. Martinez was identified as the one who handcuffed the victim. A ransom demand of ₱3 million was made.
*   **State Witness:** Aldrin Tano was discharged as a state witness, providing crucial testimony regarding the conspiracy.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of kidnapping for ransom.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole (due to RA 9346).
*   **Damages:** Joint and several liability to pay the victim:
    *   ₱50,000 civil indemnity.
    *   ₱200,000 moral damages.
    *   ₱100,000 exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Martinez's Arrest:** Martinez argued unlawful arrest due to lack of a warrant. The SC found he waived this right by entering a plea. *Relevant case law: People v. Asis*.
*   **Identification Reliability:** Martinez challenged the reliability of the minor victim's identification. The court relied on the trial court's assessment of witness credibility. *Relevant case law: People v. Castillon III*.
*   **Alibi:** Martinez's alibi was rejected due to lack of physical impossibility of being at the crime scene. *Relevant case law: People v. Tumulak*.
*   **State Witness Discharge:** De la Cruz challenged the discharge of Tano as a state witness, arguing he was not the least guilty and his testimony was not necessary. The court upheld the discharge based on the requirements of Rule 119, Section 17 of the Rules of Court and the necessity of the testimony to prove conspiracy.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 267, Revised Penal Code:** Defines kidnapping for ransom.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty.
*   **Rule 119, Section 17, Rules of Court:**  Outlines the requirements for discharging an accused to become a state witness.

**Key Legal Principles:**

*   **Waiver of Rights:** Entering a plea can waive the right to challenge an illegal arrest.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Trial courts have unique opportunity to assess witness credibility and such assessment should be upheld unless oversight of crucial facts is demonstrated.
*   **Alibi:** To prevail, an alibi must demonstrate physical impossibility of presence at the crime scene.
*   **Conspiracy:** Can be proven by circumstantial evidence demonstrating a common purpose and design.
*   **Requirements for State Witness Discharge:** The relevant rules of procedure dictate the conditions for the valid discharge of a co-accused to become a state witness.

**Overall, this case highlights the successful prosecution of a kidnapping for ransom case based on strong evidence of conspiracy and identification of the perpetrators. The ruling emphasizes the importance of trial court's evaluation of witness credibility, the strict requirements for alibi, and the procedural rules governing the discharge of state witnesses.**
