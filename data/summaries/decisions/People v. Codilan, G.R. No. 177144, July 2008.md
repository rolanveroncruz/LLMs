## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Codilan*, G.R. No. 177144 (2008)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming, with modifications, the RTC's conviction of Diosdado Codilan for two counts of rape and two counts of acts of lasciviousness.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Accusation:**  Codilan was charged with two counts of rape (Arts. 266-A & 266-B, Revised Penal Code) and two counts of acts of lasciviousness (Art. 336, Revised Penal Code) against his stepdaughter, AAA.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Prosecution:** AAA's testimony detailing the acts, corroborated by BBB's testimony regarding the December incident. Medical exam showing intact hymen.
    *   **Defense:** Denial; Claimed fabrication due to family dispute.
*   **Lower Court Findings:** RTC found Codilan guilty of all charges. CA affirmed conviction for 2 counts of rape and 2 counts of acts of lasciviousness, modifying the monetary awards.
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed CA decision with modifications, upholding conviction for simple rape (2 counts) and acts of lasciviousness (2 counts).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Codilan is obligated to serve sentences for rape (reclusion perpetua for each count) and acts of lasciviousness (4 months & 1 day *arresto mayor* to 6 years *prision correccional* for each count).
*   **Civil Liability:** Codilan is liable to pay AAA for each count of rape:
    *   P50,000 Civil Indemnity (mandatory)
    *   P50,000 Moral Damages
    *   P25,000 Exemplary Damages
    *   For each count of acts of lasciviousness P20,000 as moral damages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Discrepancy in Relationship:** The Informations identified Codilan as the "stepfather," but evidence showed he was AAA's uncle by affinity (married to her father's sister, third civil degree). This discrepancy, combined with failure to independently prove victim's minority, prevented conviction of rape with qualifying circumstances.
*   **Lack of Physical Evidence:** The intact hymen raised concerns regarding the rape charges. However, the Court cited precedent (e.g., *People v. Opeliña*, 458 Phil.1001 (2003)) that penetration, however slight, is sufficient for rape conviction, regardless of hymenal lacerations.  The time lapse between incidents and medical examination was also considered.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:**  The defense challenged the credibility of AAA and BBB, alleging fabrication. The Court, however, deferred to the trial court's assessment of witness demeanor, highlighting the vulnerability of a child victim and the straightforwardness of the testimony. The corroboration of the incident by the grandaughter added strength to the conviction.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:** Arts. 336 (Acts of Lasciviousness), 266-A & 266-B (Rape). Art. 266-B discusses qualifying circumstances elevating the offense with higher penalties (Reclusion Perpetua).
*   **Jurisprudence:**
    *   Credibility of witnesses (e.g., *People v. Fernandez*, G.R. No. 176060)
    *   Sufficient penetration for rape (e.g., *People v. Opeliña*, 458 Phil. 1001)
    *   Necessity of proving qualifying circumstances for rape (e.g., *People v. Barcena*, G.R. No. 168737)
    *   Mandatory civil indemnity for rape
    *   Moral damages in rape cases automatically granted.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** The lack of definitive proof of AAA's age and the misrepresentation of the relationship with the victim by the perpetrator were significant issues impacting the penalties imposed. This led to conviction for simple rape rather than rape with qualifying circumstances under Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code. While the court found credible evidence to convict, reliance on witness testimony in the absence of corroborating physical evidence always presents a potential challenge on appeal.
