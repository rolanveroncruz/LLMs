**Case Summary: Nissan North Edsa Balintawak vs. Serrano, Jr. and Tagulao (G.R. No. 162538)**

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the CA's reinstatement of the Labor Arbiter's decision finding Nissan liable for illegal dismissal.

**Key Issue:** Whether the dismissal of Serrano and Tagulao was illegal, and consequently, whether they are entitled to reinstatement, backwages, and separation pay.

**Facts:**

*   Serrano and Tagulao were drivers for Nissan. They were accused of failing to deliver two rolls of tint.
*   Nissan terminated their employment.
*   Serrano and Tagulao filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, seeking separation pay, backwages, and other benefits.

**Labor Arbiter Decision:** Ruled in favor of Serrano and Tagulao, finding the dismissals illegal due to lack of valid cause (failure to prove asportation). Awarded backwages, separation pay, SIL, proportionate 13th month pay, and attorney's fees.

**NLRC Decision:** Affirmed the illegal dismissal finding but deleted the award of backwages and separation pay, arguing they were not specifically prayed for in the complaint, citing Section 3, Rule V of the NLRC Rules of Procedure. Relied on *Santos v. NLRC* 154 SCRA 166, regarding reinstatement and backwages as remedy for illegal dismissal.

**Court of Appeals Decision:** Reversed the NLRC and reinstated the Labor Arbiter's decision. Held that the complaint included "illegal dismissal" as a cause of action and "reinstatement" as a relief sought. Cited Section 2, Rule V of the NLRC Rules of Procedure as basis for allowing claims in the position paper.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   Denied Nissan's petition and affirmed the CA decision.
*   Nissan failed to prove a valid cause for dismissal (asportation of company property). Loss of trust and confidence must be based on clearly established facts and a willful breach.
*   Affirmed Tagulao and Serrano are entitled to reinstatement and backwages. Reinstatement may be substituted with separation pay if not feasible.
*   Cited Article 279 of the Labor Code regarding reinstatement and backwages for unjustly dismissed employees.
*   Referenced *Santos v. NLRC* 238 Phil. 161, emphasizing that separation pay is not a substitute for backwages.

**Key Provisions, Obligations, and Liabilities:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Nissan found liable for illegally dismissing Serrano and Tagulao.
*   **Reinstatement:** Ordered, but may be substituted by separation pay if not feasible.
*   **Backwages:** Obligation to pay backwages from the time of dismissal until actual reinstatement (or judgment if reinstatement is not possible).
*   **Separation Pay:** Obligation to pay separation pay as a substitute for reinstatement if reinstatement is not feasible.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Employer (Nissan) bears the burden of proving a valid cause for termination.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** 10% of the monetary award.
*   SIL, 13th Month Pay, Unpaid Wages: Required to be paid proportionally.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **High Monetary Judgment:** Nissan faces a potentially substantial monetary judgment encompassing backwages, separation pay, unpaid wages, SIL, 13th-month pay, and attorney's fees.
*   **Damage to Reputation:** The finding of illegal dismissal can negatively affect Nissan's reputation.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 279 of the Labor Code:** Pertaining to reinstatement and backwages for illegally dismissed employees.
*   **Section 2, Rule V, and Section 3, Rule V of the NLRC Rules of Procedure:** Regarding claims in the complaint and position paper.
*   ***Santos v. NLRC* (154 SCRA 166):** Cited by the NLRC regarding the relationship between illegal dismissal, reinstatement, and backwages.
*   ***Santos v. National Labor Relations Commission* (238 Phil. 161):** Supreme Court decision distinguishing separation pay from backwages.
* ***Asiaworld Publishing House, Inc. v. Ople* (152 SCRA 219):** Regarding strained relations for employee/employer relation.
* ***Starlite Plastic Industrial Corp. v. NLRC* (171 SCRA 315, 326):** Regarding employee deciding not to be reinstated.
* ***International Travel Corp. v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 70859, Dec. 12, 1986):** Regarding employee not interested in reinstatement.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Feasibility of Reinstatement:** Determination of whether reinstatement is no longer "practicable or feasible" could be contentious and subject to interpretation.
* **Date discrepancy of missing tint rolls:** The facts are confusing and can be argued either way.

**Recommendations:**

*   Assess the financial impact of the judgment, including the calculation of backwages and separation pay based on the current salaries of Serrano and Tagulao.
*   Evaluate whether reinstatement is genuinely infeasible and explore potential settlement options.
*   Consider the potential reputational damage and implement measures to mitigate any negative impact.
