**Case Summary: Raga v. Usman, A.M. No. RTJ-07-2053, November 27, 2008**

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against Judge Sibanah E. Usman for dishonesty, violation of R.A. No. 3019, gross misconduct, violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, unjustified absences, untruthful statements in certificate of service, and violation of Rule 139-B.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Judge Usman is found GUILTY of making untruthful statements in his certificate of service for September 2001 by falsely certifying complete attendance despite absences on September 7 and 21.
*   **Evidence:** The Court relied on the 1st Indorsement signed by Branch Clerk of Court Atty. Escobar and constancias, which explicitly indicated Judge Usman's absence. The Supreme Court also referred to jurisprudence regarding the duty of judges in making a certificate of service (Office of the Court Administrator v. Andaya, A.M. No. RTJ-02-1676, August 28, 2003, 410 SCRA 47, 50-51, Office of the Court Administrator v. Trocino, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1936, May 29, 2007, 523 SCRA 262, 271.)
*   **Defense & Rebuttal:** Judge Usman claimed forgery of his signature on the certificate and blamed the complainant (Court Process Server). The Court rejected these defenses, citing lack of evidence and a judge's duty to supervise personnel (Office of the Court Administrator v. Sayo, Jr., A.M. Nos. RTJ-00-1587, May 7, 2002, 381 SCRA 659, 676).
*   **Sanction:** Judge Usman is SUSPENDED from office without salary and other benefits for one (1) month.

**Obligations:**

*   Judge's obligation to submit truthful and accurate certificate of service.
*   Judges duty to be truthful and honest.
*   Judge's Duty to organize and supervise their court personnel.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative liability for making untruthful statements in the certificate of service.

**Potential Risks:**

*   False statements in official documents can lead to administrative disciplinary action.
*   Failure to supervise and manage subordinates effectively can be viewed negatively.
