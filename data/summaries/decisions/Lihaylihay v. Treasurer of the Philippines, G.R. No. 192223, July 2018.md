## Legal Document Summary: *Lihaylihay v. The Treasurer of the Philippines, et al.* (G.R. No. 192223)

**Nature:** Decision on a Petition for Mandamus and Damages with Prayer for Writ of Garnishment filed by Danilo A. Lihaylihay seeking informer's reward for alleged information leading to the recovery of ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses.

**Key Holding:** The Supreme Court *denied* the petition, holding that mandamus is not proper to compel the respondents (Treasurer of the Philippines, Secretary of Finance, Secretary of DENR, and Governor of BSP) to pay the informer's reward.  The determination of entitlement to an informer's reward is a *discretionary, quasi-judicial* function, not a ministerial duty. The Petitioner failed to establish a *clear legal right* to the reward, and failed to exhaust available administrative remedies. The Court warned the petitioner against future frivolous litigations.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner's Claim:** Lihaylihay claimed entitlement to 25% informer's reward under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 2338 for providing information on Marcos' ill-gotten wealth.
*   **Republic Act No. 2338:**  The Court noted that Section 1 of RA 2338, the basis for the claim, has been superseded by Section 282 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (as amended), highlighting the now-controlling statutory framework for informer's rewards.
*   **Section 282, NIRC of 1997 (amended):** Current controlling statute, requiring that information is voluntarily given, definite, sworn, not previously known to the BIR, and leads to the recovery of revenues or conviction of the guilty party. The reward is now 10% or P1,000,000, whichever is lower.
*   **Revenue Regulations No. 016-10:** The guidelines governing the procedure for processing claims for informerâ€™s reward.
*   **Rule 65, Section 3, Rules of Civil Procedure:** This dictates the parameters for the issuance of a writ of mandamus, which the Court stated requires a "clear legal right" of the petitioner and a "correlative duty" of the respondent.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioner's Lack of Clear Legal Right:** Lihaylihay failed to demonstrate that his information led specifically to the recovery of proceeds from *tax offenses*. His claims were considered broad, not specific, and the wealth recovery cases in the Sandiganbayan did not necessarily pertain to tax violations.
*   **Discretionary Nature of Reward:**  The grant of an informer's reward is not automatic; it involves discretionary judgment by the relevant authorities (BIR, Secretary of Finance) to assess the validity and impact of the information provided. This determination is quasi-judicial.
*   **Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies:** Lihaylihay prematurely filed the Petition without awaiting the Secretary of Finance's decision on his claims.
*   **Forum Shopping:**  Petitioner filed multiple similar claims, including a prior petition for mandamus and claims with the COA, indicative of forum shopping.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Lim Tay v. Court of Appeals*: "Mandamus will not issue to establish a right, but only to enforce one that is already established."
*   *Pefianco v. Moral*: A writ of mandamus "never issues in doubtful cases."
*   *Sy Ha v. Galang*: Mandamus cannot control the exercise of discretion of a public officer.
*   *Sanson v. Barrios*: Distinguishes between discretionary and ministerial duties.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Court highlights that even if one were to overlook the procedural deficiencies of the petitioner, the petitioner still has not shown a clear legal right worthy of a writ of mandamus. This suggests the Court has found other potential bars of recovery even if the petitioner had properly filed his claims.
*   The Court underscores the need to comply with procedural and substantive standards set by law for the grant of remedies, and that availability of reliefs is not a matter of personal preference.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 2338 (superseded)
*   Presidential Decree No. 707
*   National Internal Revenue Code of 1977
*   Presidential Decree No. 1773
*   National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (amended)
*   Republic Act No. 8424 (Tax Reform Act of 1997)
*   Rule 65, Section 3 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure
*   Revenue Regulations No. 016-10

**Potential Risks for Informers:**

*   The informer reward system requires strict adherence to procedural rules, specific information, and proof of direct causation between the information provided and the government's recovery or conviction.
*   Vague or broad allegations lacking specificity will likely be unsuccessful.
*   Premature litigation can undermine the informer's claim.
*   The determination of the degree of relationship between the Internal Revenue or Customs official or employee and the informer shall be left not only to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the Commissioner of Customs, as the case may be, but should be jointly made by such official and the Solicitor General.
