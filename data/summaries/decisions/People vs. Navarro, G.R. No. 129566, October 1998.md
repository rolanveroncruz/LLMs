Okay, here's a summary of the Philippine Supreme Court decision *People v. Navarro*, G.R. No. 129566, October 7, 1998, formatted for a legal professional.

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Noel Navarro* G.R. No. 129566, October 7, 1998.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's conviction of Noel Navarro for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, qualified by treachery, but modified the ruling by deleting the award of actual damages and finding that illegal possession of firearms was not proven beyond reasonable doubt to be an aggravating circumstance.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Navarro was charged with murder and violation of Presidential Decree (PD) 1866 (illegal possession of firearms).
*   **Factual Basis:** The prosecution's key witness, Jose Rabago, testified that Navarro, along with Ming Basila, shot and killed Ferdinand Rabadon. Rabago initially did not report the identities of the assailants to the police, citing fear of the "Aguila Gang" allegedly associated with Navarro's brother. Rabago later recanted his testimony as a prosecution witness, identifying another person as the killer.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** The trial court found Navarro guilty of murder, qualified by treachery. It considered the illegal possession of firearms as an aggravating circumstance, even though the firearm was never recovered or presented as evidence. The court awarded the victim's heirs P50,000 in indemnity and P50,000 in actual damages.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:**

    *   **Credibility of Witness:** The Court upheld the trial court's finding that Rabago's initial testimony was credible and sufficient to sustain a conviction. It emphasized that a retraction does not automatically negate earlier credible testimony, citing *People v. Soria*, 262 SCRA 739 (1996).
    *   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The testimony of a single witness, if positive and clear, is sufficient to sustain a judgment of conviction, even for murder, citing *People v. Hayahay et al.*, GR No. 120550, September 26, 1997.
    *   **Res Gestae:**  The Court clarified that the concept of *res gestae* relates to admissibility of evidence, not its weight or sufficiency, citing *Pantranco North Express, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 224 SCRA 477 (1993). Rabago's initial report to one policeman, stating only that his companion was shot, was considered part of the *res gestae*.
    *   **Illegal Arrest:** Navarro's claim of illegal arrest was deemed waived because he voluntarily submitted to the trial court's jurisdiction by entering a plea and participating in the trial, citing *People v Tidula*, GR No. 123273, July 16, 1998.
    *   **Treachery:** The Court affirmed the finding of treachery, as the victim was attacked suddenly and unexpectedly and was defenseless when Navarro shot him.
    *   **Illegal Possession of Firearms:** The Court overturned the finding that illegal possession of firearms aggravated the murder. The prosecution failed to sufficiently establish the existence of the specific firearm and its lack of license.
*   **Damages:** The award of actual damages was deleted because the victim's mother did not present receipts or other documentary evidence to support her claim. Indemnity of P50,000 was affirmed.

**Obligations:**

*   Navarro is obligated to pay P50,000 as indemnity to the heirs of Ferdinand Rabadon.

**Liabilities:**

*   Navarro is criminally liable for murder and is subject to the penalty of *reclusion perpetua*.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Witness Credibility:** The case heavily relies on the credibility of a single witness who recanted his initial testimony. While the Court upheld the initial testimony, any weakness or doubt cast upon it could potentially be grounds for future challenges (although unlikely given the finality of Supreme Court decisions).
*   **PD 1866 Amendment:**  The Court noted the effect of RA 8294 (amending PD 1866) which treats the use of an unlicensed firearm simply as an aggravating circumstance in murder or homicide.  The Court implied that if illegal possession of firearms had been proven, the amendment would apply.
