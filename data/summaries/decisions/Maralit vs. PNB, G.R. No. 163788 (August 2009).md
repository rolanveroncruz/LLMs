## Legal Document Summary: Maralit v. PNB (G.R. No. 163788, August 24, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' decision which reversed the NLRC's affirmation of the Labor Arbiter's decision in favor of the Petitioner, Ester B. Maralit.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **SSIP (Special Separation Incentive Plan):** PNB offered an early retirement plan (SSIP) to its personnel. General Circular No. 1-355/98 outlined the guidelines.
*   **Contingency Clause:** SSIP benefits for employees with pending administrative cases or preliminary investigations were contingent upon the favorable resolution of those cases (i.e., not disqualifying the employee from receiving benefits).
*   **Maralit's Case:** Maralit, a PNB branch manager, applied for early retirement under the SSIP. Prior to approval, PNB's Internal Audit Group (IAG) investigated her for violations of bank policies related to unfunded checks amounting to P54,950,000, constituting Drawings Against Uncollected Deposits (DAUD), contrary to General Circular 3-335/97.
*   **Administrative Charges & Suspension:** PNB charged Maralit with serious misconduct, gross violation of bank rules, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the bank (Art. 282, Labor Code). She was preventively suspended.
*   **Conditional Retirement Approval:** PNB conditionally approved Maralit's SSIP application, making payment contingent on the resolution of the administrative case.
*   **Dismissal:** After investigation by the IIU (Inspection and Investigation Unit) and AAP (Administrative Adjudication Panel), PNB dismissed Maralit with forfeiture of retirement benefits.
*   **Labor Arbiter & NLRC Rulings:** The Labor Arbiter initially ruled in favor of Maralit, awarding retirement benefits and damages. The NLRC affirmed with modification (removing exemplary damages).
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** The Court of Appeals reversed the NLRC, finding that Maralit was under preliminary investigation when she applied for early retirement and was afforded due process.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **PNB:** Obligated to pay SSIP benefits if Maralit was not disqualified based on the administrative case.
*   **Maralit:** Obligated to adhere to bank policies and procedures.

**Potential Liabilities:**

*   **Maralit:** Liable for serious misconduct and violations of bank rules, potentially justifying dismissal and forfeiture of retirement benefits.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 282, Labor Code:** Just causes for termination, including serious misconduct.
*   **Articles 217 & 223, Labor Code:** Jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters and the NLRC; appeal procedures.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 (as amended by Republic Act No. 7902):** Powers of the Court of Appeals to receive evidence and resolve factual issues.
*   **General Circular 3-335/97 of May 15, 1997** Stipulates rules on Drawings Against Uncollected Deposits (DAUD).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **"Preliminary Investigation":** Whether the IAG's investigation and PNB's memoranda constituted a "preliminary investigation" at the time Maralit applied for SSIP is disputed. The Court held it did.
*   **Due Process:** Maralit argued she was denied due process. The court held that the opportunity to submit a written explanation and answer the charges was sufficient. *Lagatic v. NLRC* (349 Phil. 172) is cited, where no formal hearing is necessary if an employee admits responsibility for an alleged misconduct.
*   **Finality of Retirement:** Maralit argued that her retirement was already approved before the dismissal.  The Court held that the conditional approval clause permitted forfeiture of benefits due to the misconduct.
*   **Authority of CA in Certiorari:**  Maralit contested the Court of Appeals' authority to make factual determinations in a certiorari proceeding. The court noted that *Gutib v. Court of Appeals* (371 Phil. 293) grants a wide latitude in certiorari proceedings and *Globe Telecom, Inc. v. Florendo-Flores* (438 Phil. 756) allows for the re-examination of questioned findings.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **For PNB:** Potential liability for retirement benefits if the dismissal was deemed invalid and due process lacking.
*   **For Maralit:** Forfeiture of retirement benefits due to serious misconduct and violation of bank rules.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied Maralit's petition, upholding the Court of Appeals' decision.  The Court found that Maralit was under preliminary investigation when she applied for early retirement, was afforded due process, and that her serious misconduct justified her dismissal and forfeiture of retirement benefits. The Court emphasized the importance of upholding bank rules and regulations and protecting the bank from loss.
