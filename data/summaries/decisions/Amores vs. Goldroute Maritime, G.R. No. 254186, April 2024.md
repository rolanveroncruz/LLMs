Here's a concise legal summary of the provided document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Solito C. Amores, Jr. vs. Goldroute Maritime Inc.* (G.R. No. 254186, April 17, 2024)

**Subject:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding entitlement to total and permanent disability benefits under a seafarer's employment contract.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contract:** POEA-SEC based contract; 9-month term as oiler.
*   **Repatriation:** Seafarer (Petitioner) repatriated before contract end, allegedly due to chest pains and shortness of breath.  Crucially, the SC found he was *not* medically repatriated.
*   **Post-Employment Medical Examination (PEME):** Petitioner claims he requested one upon arrival, but was denied. Respondent denies this. The SC favored that there was no denial of a medical request.
*   **Company-Designated Physician (CDP):** Petitioner underwent PEME where declared unfit for sea duty due to Hypertension, Controlled, T/C Ischemic Heart for Work-Up. Referred to cardiologist.
*   **Cardiologist:** Dr. Javier assessed Hypertensive cardiovascular disease to rule out Atherosclerotic Heart Disease. Suggested CT Angiogram.
*   **Dispute:** Petitioner filed for disability benefits *before* completing recommended medical tests and before a final disability rating was issued. He argued his condition was work-related, citing Section 32-A (11) of POEA-SEC.
*   **Voluntary Arbitration (PVA):** Ruled in favor of the petitioner.
*   **Court of Appeals (CA):** Reversed PVA, holding claim was premature. Awarded sickness allowance only.

**Issue:**  Is the Petitioner entitled to total and permanent disability benefits?

**Ruling:** Supreme Court DENIED the petition, affirming the CA decision that the seafarer is **not** entitled to total and permanent disability benefits.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Prematurity:**  Petitioner filed claim prematurely, *before* completing CDP-recommended tests. This is key. The court held that petitionerâ€™s haste in filing the complaint meant he was not yet entitled to benefits and the report declaring the petitioner unfit was only an interim assessment to determine his fitness for his re-deployment.
*   **No Medical Repatriation:** Distinguishes facts from *Dionio* case. Petitioner was *not* repatriated for medical reasons, thus the employer's obligation to provide immediate post-employment medical assessment did not arise in the same way.
*   **Lack of Proof of Work-Relatedness:** Petitioner failed to establish a causal link between his working conditions and his illness, and it was not shown that his illness existed during his employment. Burden of proof on the seafarer.
*   **Failure to Follow POEA-SEC:** The court held that the refusal to follow the advice of the company designated physicians to go to the testing they recommended contravenes the terms and conditions of the employment contract with the respondent.

**Statutory References:**

*   Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC), particularly Section 20(B)(3) & (4), and Section 32-A.

**Case Law:**

*   *Dionisio v. ND Shipping Agency* (distinguished - facts different, seafarer was medically repatriated)
*   *Interorient Maritime Enterprises, Inc. v. Remo* (distinguished)
*   *Apines v. Elburg Shipmanagement Philippines, Inc.* (distinguished)
*   *De Andres v. Diamond H Marine Services* (distinguished)
* *Balbarino v. Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc.*

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:**  Credibility issues regarding whether the seafarer requested, and was denied, a post-employment medical exam. SC disbelieved this.
*   **Definition of "Premature Filing":** Timing is critical. The court emphasized that filing before a final disability rating is issued by the CDP (after reasonable time and investigations) can be fatal to the claim.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The seafarer bears the burden to prove work-relatedness, even with the disputable presumption in Section 20(B)(4) of POEA-SEC.

**Liabilities:**

*   Employer (Goldroute Maritime Inc.) is *not* liable for total and permanent disability benefits in this case.  They *are* liable for sickness allowance from repatriation until the claim was filed (as per CA), but that was not contested in this appeal.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The case highlights the importance of clear documentation regarding the reasons for repatriation (medical vs. non-medical).
*   The time frame for completing medical examinations and issuing final disability assessments under POEA-SEC can be a source of contention. This case reaffirms that premature filing is a significant risk for seafarers.
