## Legal Document Summary: People v. Pulusan, G.R. No. 110037 (1998)

**Case Overview:** This is a criminal case appeal concerning a conviction for robbery with homicide and rape stemming from a highway robbery of a passenger jeepney. Appellants Eduardo Pulusan and Rolando Rodriguez were convicted by the RTC of Bulacan under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Crime:** The information originally charged "highway robbery attended with multiple homicide and multiple rape." However, the Supreme Court clarified that the crime is properly classified as robbery with homicide under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code, aggravated by rape. The Court emphasized that "regardless of the number of homicides committed on the occasion of a robbery, the crime of still robbery with homicide".
*   **Conspiracy:** The Court found sufficient evidence of conspiracy between the four perpetrators (including the two appellants), establishing unity of purpose and design in the execution of the crimes. *Case Law: People v. Parica, et al.* Once conspiracy is proven, each conspirator is liable for the acts of the others.
*   **Identification:** The Court upheld the trial court's finding that the surviving victims positively identified Pulusan and Rodriguez. The Court emphasized the credibility assigned to trial judge. *Case Law: People v. Torres.* The arguments over "conflicting testimonies" were deemed trivial and indicative of veracity. The element of visibility for identification of criminals favored the eyewitnesses *Case Law: People v. Mendoza.*
*   **Alibi:** The Court rejected the appellants' alibis, finding that they did not establish physical impossibility of being at the crime scene and were undermined by positive identification.
*   **Penalty:** The RTC sentenced the appellants to *reclusion perpetua*. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence and specified monetary awards to the heirs and the rape victim. Due to the prohibition of death penalty and considering that RA 7659 "An Act to Impose the Death Penalty on Certain Heinous Crimes" had not yet been enacted during the time, the penalty of death could not be implemented, and instead, reclusion perpetua was implemented.

**Obligations:**

*   Pulusan and Rodriguez are jointly and severally liable for:
    *   Civil indemnity to the heirs of each deceased victim (increased by the Supreme Court to P50,000.00 per victim).
    *   Moral damages to the heirs of the deceased victims (P20,000.00 per heir).
    *   Moral damages to the rape victim, Marilyn Martinez (increased by the Supreme Court to P200,000.00, in light of the multiple rapes). *Case Law: People v. Espinoza.*
    *   Reimbursement of funeral expenses for the deceased.
    *   Return of stolen items (or their monetary equivalent) to the victims.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for robbery with homicide aggravated by rape.
*   Civil liability for the aforementioned monetary awards.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Highway Robbery vs. Robbery with Homicide:** The initial information designated the crime as "highway robbery." The Supreme Court clarified that it was robbery with homicide, but a separate charge under PD 532 (Anti-Piracy and Anti-Highway Robbery Law) was not discussed, which could potentially have carried a different penalty (if the elements of organized indiscriminate robbery were proven).
*   **Third Perpetrators:** Two other individuals, Rolando Tayag and "John Doe alias Ramon/Efren," were implicated, but remained at large, which could lead to further investigation and prosecution if apprehended.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Torres, 247 SCRA 212 (1995):** Credibility of witnesses best determined by the trial judge.
*   **People v. Parica, 243 SCRA 557 (1995):**  Conspiracy need not be proven by direct evidence; may be inferred from actions.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 254 SCRA 61 (1996):** Visibility and identification in robbery cases.
*   **People v. Espinoza, 247 SCRA 66 (1995):** Awards for multiple rapes and the corresponding compensation
