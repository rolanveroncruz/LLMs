## Legal Document Summary: *Bolos, Jr. v. COMELEC* (G.R. No. 184082)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing COMELEC Resolutions disqualifying Petitioner, Nicasio Bolos, Jr., from running for Punong Barangay due to the three-term limit.

**Key Issue:** Whether Bolos' assumption of the office of Sangguniang Bayan member, after winning election while serving his third term as Punong Barangay, constituted a "voluntary renunciation" of the latter office under Section 8, Article X of the Constitution and Section 43(b) of RA 7160 (Local Government Code), thereby triggering the three-term limit disqualification.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *DISMISSED* the petition, affirming the COMELEC Resolutions. The Court held that Bolos' actions demonstrated a voluntary renunciation of his Punong Barangay position.

**Key Provisions & Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Three-Term Limit (Constitution and LGC):** Section 8, Article X of the Constitution and Section 43(b) of RA 7160 prohibit local elective officials from serving more than three consecutive terms in the same position.  Voluntary renunciation does not interrupt the continuity of service.
*   **Voluntary Renunciation:** The Court agreed with COMELEC's finding that Bolos voluntarily renounced his position as Punong Barangay. His decision to run for Sangguniang Bayan while already serving as Punong Barangay indicated an intent to relinquish the latter position if elected, similar to abandonment.
*   **"Operation of Law" Argument Rejected:** Bolos argued his departure from the Punong Barangay post was by "operation of law" and thus involuntary. The Court rejected this, distinguishing the case from *Montebon v. COMELEC* and *Borja, Jr. v. COMELEC*. In those cases, an official assumed a higher office due to a vacancy, making the transition involuntary. Here, Bolos affirmatively sought and won a different office, demonstrating voluntary relinquishment. The court cited the Philippine Legal Encyclopedia and Black’s Law Dictionary defining "operation of law" and emphasizing rights that are acquired or lost by the effect of a legal rule without any act of the person affected.
*   **Two-Pronged Test (Lonzanida v. COMELEC):** The Court applied the two-pronged test for disqualification: (1) election to three consecutive terms and (2) full service of three consecutive terms. While Bolos didn’t serve his full third term in *that* specific position, his voluntary departure meant that there was no interruption within the meaning of the three-term rule.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity in "Voluntary Renunciation":** Defining "voluntary renunciation" remains fact-dependent.  Future cases may hinge on the specific circumstances surrounding an official's decision to pursue another office.
*   **Impact on Voters' Choice:** The decision could be perceived as disenfranchising voters who elected Bolos.
