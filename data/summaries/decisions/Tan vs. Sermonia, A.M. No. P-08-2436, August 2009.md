Okay, here's a legal summary of the document provided, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Teopicio Tan v. Salvacion D. Sermonia*, A.M. No. P-08-2436, August 04, 2009.

**Summary:** This is an administrative case against Salvacion D. Sermonia, Clerk IV of the MTCC, Iloilo City, for willful failure to pay a just debt to Teopicio Tan and conduct unbecoming a court employee, and for her failure to comply with directives from the OCA to file her comment on the administrative complaint.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Debt:** Sermonia purchased construction materials on credit from Tan amounting to P15,145.50. She failed to pay despite demands.
*   **Civil Case No. 20730 (MTCC):** Tan successfully sued Sermonia for collection of sum of money. The MTCC rendered a Decision ordering Sermonia to pay the principal amount, plus interest, attorney's fees, and costs. This judgment is final and executory.
*   **Admission of Debt:**  Sermonia admitted the existence of the debt in her comment, but disputed the accuracy of the amount due due to alleged payments made, which she could not prove.
*   **Willful Failure to Pay Just Debt:** The Court defined "just debts" as claims adjudicated by a court of law *or* claims admitted by the debtor.  The Court found Sermonia guilty of willful failure to pay a just debt based both on her admission and the MTCC judgment.
*   **Failure to Comply with OCA Directive:** Sermonia failed to file a timely comment despite extensions granted by the OCA, which the court views as disrespect and insubordination.

**Obligations:**

*   Sermonia has a legal obligation to pay Tan P15,145.50, plus 12% interest per annum, 25% attorney's fees, and costs of suit, per the MTCC Decision in Civil Case No. 20730.
*   Sermonia has an obligation to comply with lawful directives of the OCA and the Supreme Court.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Sermonia is found guilty of willful failure to pay a just debt.
*   **Suspension:** Sermonia is suspended for six (6) months without pay.
*   **Admonishment:** Sermonia is admonished for failure to promptly file her comment.
*   **Civil Liability:** Reinforces the already existing liability from Civil Case No. 20730.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Conduct:** A repetition of similar acts, including violating the Resolution, will result in more severe punishment.
*   **Enforcement of Judgment:** Tan can pursue enforcement of the MTCC judgment through legal means if Sermonia fails to pay within the specified six-month period.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 22(1), Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292, as amended by CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19, series of 1999:**  Addresses willful failure to pay just debts.
*   **Section 53, Rule IV of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Grants discretion to consider mitigating circumstances.
*   **In Re: Complaint for Failure to Pay Just Debts Against Esther T. Andres, 493 Phil. 1, 11 (2005):** Underscores the importance of proper behavior of court employees.
*   **Previous Cases:** *Madia-as Lending Corporation v. Salvacion Sermonia* and *GRIO Lending Services v. Salvacion Sermonia* were cited, establishing a pattern of behavior.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sermonia's claim of previous partial payments:** This claim was not substantiated due to the alleged loss of receipts, but it was considered to a limited extent as a mitigating factor in determining the penalty.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The court considered Sermonia's length of service (30 years), acknowledgment of debt, financial and health difficulties, and the not-so-substantial amount of the unpaid obligation as mitigating circumstances, reducing the penalty from dismissal to suspension.
* The administrative case focuses on the *failure to pay*, impacting Sermonia's conduct as a public official, and the MTCC judgment solidifies the “justness” of the debt.
