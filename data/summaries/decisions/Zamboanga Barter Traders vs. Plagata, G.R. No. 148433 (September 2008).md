Okay, here's a legal summary of *Zamboanga Barter Traders Kilusang Bayan, Inc. vs. Hon. Julius Rhett J. Plagata, et al.*, G.R. No. 148433, September 30, 2008:

**Case Summary:**

This case involves a *Petition for Review on Certiorari* assailing the Court of Appeals decision which upheld the validity of a Writ of Possession issued by the Executive Labor Arbiter (ELA) in favor of private respondent Teopisto Mendoza against petitioner Zamboanga Barter Traders Kilusang Bayan, Inc. (ZBTKBI). The central issues revolve around the legality of the execution sale of land previously donated by ZBTKBI to the Republic of the Philippines and the propriety of issuing a writ of possession based on that sale.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Donation with Conditions:** ZBTKBI donated land to the Republic via a Deed of Donation, stipulating that the Republic would construct a barter trade market. A crucial condition stated that the land would revert to ZBTKBI if barter trading was phased out for over one year.
*   **Phase-Out of Barter Trading:**  Barter trading was phased out in Zamboanga City effective October 1, 1988, triggering the reversion clause in the deed of donation.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:**  Prior to the donation, Teopisto Mendoza was an employee of ZBTKBI, and he filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. He won a judgment for reinstatement and backwages in NLRC Case No. RAB IX-0133-81.
*   **Unsatisfied Judgment & Execution:** Initial writs of execution to satisfy Mendoza's judgment were unsuccessful. A second alias writ of execution was issued in 1990, leading to the levy and subsequent execution sale of ZBTKBI's interest in the *reverted* land. Mendoza was the highest bidder.
*   **Writ of Possession:** Mendoza, unable to take possession, sought and obtained a Writ of Possession from the ELA, prompting ZBTKBI's petition.

**Key Issues & Arguments:**

*   **Ownership of the Land at the Time of Levy & Sale:** ZBTKBI argued that the levy was invalid because it was made on land belonging to the Republic, thus requiring notice to the Republic. The Supreme Court (SC) ruled that the land had reverted to ZBTKBI prior to the levy due to the phase-out of barter trading, so notice to Republic wasn't required. However, the improvements made by the Republic on the Land should be returned to the Republic.
*   **Validity of the Execution After 5 Years:** ZBTKBI argued that the judgment could no longer be executed by mere motion because over five years had passed since the judgment became final.  *Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court* (now 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure) was invoked. The SC ruled that the 5 year period was interrupted due to ZBTKBI's actions/inactions in preventing satisfaction of prior writs, therefore execution by motion was proper.  The Court cited *Lancita v. Magbanua, Republic v. Court of Appeals, and Gonzales v. Court of Appeals* for the exception to the 5-year rule.
*   **Excessive Levy/Inadequate Price:**  ZBTKBI argued the levy of a property allegedly worth significantly more than the judgment debt constituted grave abuse of discretion. ZBTKBI also argues that it was not aware to exercise the right to redeem the property. SC rejected this argument, stating that if there is a right to redeem it is not material if the bid price is low and ruled it was not up to the courts to determine a reason for the inaction of ZBTKBI. The Court cited *Hulst v. PR Builders, Inc.* for the exception to the 5-year rule.

**Ruling & Rationale:**

The Supreme Court *denied* the petition and *affirmed* the Court of Appeals' decision.

The SC reasoned that since barter trading was phased out, the land had reverted to ZBTKBI per the Deed of Donation's explicit terms. Since the Republic was not the owner at the time of the levy and execution sale, the Republic wasn't deprived of due process. The SC emphasized that the conditions in the deed of donation were valid and binding as per *Article 1306 of the Civil Code* and the ruling in *Dolar v. Barangay Lublub (Now P.D. Monfort North) Municipality of Dumangas*, citing *Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila v. Court of Appeals*.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   ** Valuation of Improvements:** While the land reverts, the Republic retains ownership of the building and improvements. Valuation of these improvements could be a point of contention if ZBTKBI chooses to exercise its first option to purchase, since it could be claimed as the owner of the property.
*   **Congressional Hearing Admissions:** The fact that the Executive Labor Arbiter admitted to violating the Rules of Court in a Congressional hearing, although noted by the Court, did not ultimately sway the decision due to the SC's finding that the 5 year period was interrupted.
