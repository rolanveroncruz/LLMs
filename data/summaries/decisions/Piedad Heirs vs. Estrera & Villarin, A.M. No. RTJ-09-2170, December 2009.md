## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Piedad v. Estrera and Villarin* (A.M. No. RTJ-09-2170)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against two RTC judges for gross ignorance of the law and undue delay.

**Key Facts:** Following a final and executory judgment in Civil Case No. 435-T (annulment of deed of sale) in favor of Simeon Piedad, and the issuance of a writ of demolition, Candelaria Bobilles (defendant in the civil case) filed a Petition for Probate (S.P. Proc. No. 457-T) and a Petition for TRO/Preliminary Injunction (S.P. Proc. No. 463-T) to stop the demolition. Executive Judge Estrera, despite the ongoing civil case in a co-equal court (Branch 9, Cebu City RTC), issued a TRO against the sheriff enforcing the writ of demolition. Judge Villarin later extended the TRO. Motions to dismiss the TRO petition and to lift the injunction were filed but remained unresolved by Judge Villarin.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Judge Estrera's Liability:** Found guilty of gross ignorance of the law for interfering with a co-equal court's judgment by issuing a TRO.  Violated the doctrine of judicial stability/non-interference.
*   **Judge Villarin's Liability:** Found guilty of both gross ignorance of the law (for extending the TRO) and undue delay in rendering an order for failing to rule on pending motions. Violated Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct regarding prompt disposition of court business.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct (prompt disposition of court business)
*   Section 9, Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court (less serious charges, undue delay)
*   Sec. 11(b) of Rule 140 (punishment for less serious charges)

**Case Law:**

*   ***Cabigao v. Del Rosario***: Established the doctrine that no court can interfere with the judgments of a co-equal court.
*   ***Cojuangco v. Villegas***: Reiterates the doctrine of non-interference by injunction.
*   ***Yau v. The Manila Banking Corporation***: Undue interference with co-equal court proceedings is prohibited.
*   ***Parco v. Court of Appeals***: Defines the coordinate and co-equal relationship between branches of the CFI.
*   ***Mactan Cebu International Airport v. Hontanosa, Jr.***: Judges are expected to maintain professional competence and should be held liable for gross ignorance of the law.
*   ***Biggel v. Pamintuan***: Undue delay erodes public faith in the judiciary; cases must be decided promptly.

**Liabilities/Penalties:**

*   Both Judges Estrera and Villarin were fined Php 21,000 for gross ignorance of the law.
*   Judge Villarin was additionally fined Php 11,000 for undue delay in rendering an order.
*   Stern warning issued against both judges regarding future infractions.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The ambiguity lies within Judge Villarin's inaction, arguing the motion was moot. The Court rejected this, stating he should have ruled on the merits instead of ignoring the issue.
*   The case highlights the importance of understanding jurisdictional limitations and the proper application of procedural rules, especially when dealing with cases that could potentially overlap with other pending cases handled by co-equal courts.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the OCA's findings that the respondent judges were administratively liable for interfering with a co-equal court's orders and for undue delay in resolving pending motions. The decision reinforces the principles of judicial stability, adherence to procedural rules, and the duty of judges to act promptly and competently in their judicial functions.
