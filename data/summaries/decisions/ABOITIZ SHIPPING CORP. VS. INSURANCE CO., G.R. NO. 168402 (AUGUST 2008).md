**Case:** *Aboitiz Shipping Corporation vs. Insurance Company of North America (ICNA)*, G.R. No. 168402, August 6, 2008.

**Subject Matter:** Subrogation rights of an insurer, notice of claim requirements for damaged cargo, liability of a common carrier.

**Facts:**

*   MSAS Cargo International procured marine insurance from ICNA UK Limited for wooden work tools/benches shipped to STIP in Cebu.
*   Aboitiz Shipping was the domestic carrier for the Manila-Cebu leg.
*   The Bill of Lading issued by Aboitiz contained the notation "grounded outside warehouse."
*   Consignee discovered water damage upon delivery.
*   ICNA paid the consignee's claim and sought subrogation against Aboitiz.
*   RTC initially dismissed the claim. CA reversed, finding Aboitiz liable.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

1.  **Right of Subrogation:** ICNA, as insurer, claimed subrogation to the rights of the consignee (STIP) after paying the insurance claim based on Article 2207 of the Civil Code and *Pan Malayan Insurance Corporation v. Court of Appeals*. The critical question was whether ICNA was the real party in interest.
2.  **Timeliness of Notice of Claim:** Aboitiz argued that the consignee's formal claim was not made within the 24-hour period prescribed by Article 366 of the Code of Commerce, and was therefore barred and further that a representative of STIP, and not MSAS made the claim.. The court considered whether the telephone call from Willig, consignee's representative, to Aboitiz's Claims Head, Perez, constituted sufficient notice and the "grounded outside warehouse" notation was cause for an extension to the normal claim period.
3.  **Liability of Aboitiz as Common Carrier:**  The court considered the presumption of negligence against common carriers under Article 1735 of the Civil Code when goods are damaged and the inability of Aboitiz to prove "extraordinary diligence".

**Ruling/Holding:**

*   **ICNA as Real Party in Interest:** ICNA had standing to sue. Although issued by ICNA UK, ICNA filed the suit as an authorized agent listed in the open policy. Also, it may sue on isolated transactions regardless of whether it is a Philippine entity or not.
*   **Timeliness of Notice:**  The court found, *pro hac vice*, that the telephone call from Willig (consignee's representative) to Aboitiz's Claims Head (Perez), followed by Perez's investigation, constituted substantial compliance with the notice requirement, considering the practical constraints of the consignee (a school) *Philippine American General Insurance Co., Inc. v. Sweet Lines, Inc.*.
*   **Aboitiz's Liability:**  Aboitiz failed to rebut the presumption of negligence as a common carrier. The "grounded outside warehouse" notation, combined with evidence of rainfall during the storage period, supported the finding that Aboitiz's negligence caused the water damage *Republic v. Lorenzo Shipping Corporation*.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Aboitiz was held liable for the water damage to the goods and ordered to pay ICNA P280,176.92 plus interest and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Pro Hac Vice Ruling on Notice:** The court's decision on the notice issue was explicitly stated as *pro hac vice*, meaning it doesn't set a precedent for other cases. The finding of substantial compliance based on a telephone call could be challenged in future cases with different factual contexts.
*   **Scope of "Extraordinary Diligence":** The specific actions a carrier must take to demonstrate "extraordinary diligence" remain somewhat ambiguous. The court emphasized the need to safeguard against natural elements but didn't provide exhaustive guidance.
*   **Missing Bill of Lading Terms:** The absence of the bill of lading's notice of claim terms from the presented evidence introduced uncertainty. The court had to rely on statutory provisions, which may not have accurately reflected the parties' contractual agreement.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code Articles 1735, 2207.
*   Code of Commerce Article 366.
*   Insurance Code Section 57.
*   Corporation Code, Sec. 133

**Case Law:**

*   *Pan Malayan Insurance Corporation v. Court of Appeals*
*   *Philippine American General Insurance Co., Inc. v. Sweet Lines, Inc.*
*   *Philippine Charter Insurance Corporation (PCIC) v. Chemoil Lighterage Corporation*
*   *Republic v. Lorenzo Shipping Corporation*

This summary highlights the court's reasoning in finding Aboitiz liable based on the right of subrogation, the application of the presumption of negligence against common carriers, and a fact-specific determination of substantial compliance with notice requirements. The pro hac vice nature of the notice ruling and the absence of detailed guidance on extraordinary diligence are potential vulnerabilities.
