**Case Summary: *Heunghwa Industry Co., Ltd. v. DJ Builders Corporation*, G.R. No. 169095, December 8, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision upholding the jurisdiction of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) over a construction dispute.

**Facts:**

*   Heunghwa (Petitioner), a Korean corporation, subcontracted with DJ Builders (Respondent), a Philippine corporation, for earthwork on a DPWH project.
*   Disputes arose over payment, and Respondent filed a collection suit with the RTC. The subcontract contained an arbitration clause.
*   Parties initially filed a joint motion to submit specific issues (manpower, expenses, retention, billings, escalation) to CIAC.
*   Petitioner subsequently attempted to withdraw from CIAC arbitration, arguing lack of authority for the initial referral and asserting RTC jurisdiction. The RTC and CIAC issued conflicting orders regarding jurisdiction.
*   The RTC vacillated, initially referring to the CIAC, then attempting to regain jurisdiction over the entire case.
*   The CIAC maintained jurisdiction based on EO 1008 and the arbitration clause, even proceeding without Petitioner's participation.

**Key Provisions/Clauses:**

*   **Arbitration Clause (Article 7 of Subcontract Agreement):** Mandates arbitration for disputes related to the subcontract, following procedures in the prime contract or, absent that, Philippine law. Clause is broadly worded, covering "any controversy or claim" arising from the contract.
*   **Prime Contract Arbitration Clause (5.19.3):** Specifies arbitration under the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) rules.

**Issues:**

1.  Did the CIAC have jurisdiction over the dispute?
2.  Was Petitioner procedurally barred from questioning the CIAC's jurisdiction before the CA (failure to file Motion for Reconsideration) and was Petition for Certiorari an improper remedy?
3.  Did the CA err in not remanding the case to the CIAC for further evidence given Petitioner's non-participation?

**Holding:**

*   Petition DENIED. CA decision AFFIRMED, upholding CIAC's jurisdiction.

**Reasoning:**

*   **CIAC Jurisdiction:**
    *   EO 1008 grants CIAC original and exclusive jurisdiction over construction disputes where parties agree to arbitration, and the parties' agreed to submit the case for arbitration.
    *   The presence of an arbitration clause in the subcontract, regardless of reference to another arbitral body, vests CIAC with jurisdiction (citing *National Irrigation Administration v. Court of Appeals*).
    *   **Key Point:** CIAC's jurisdiction is triggered by the **agreement to arbitrate**, regardless of the specific arbitral body named in the agreement.
    *   Subsequent consent to submit the case for arbitration is unnecessary, despite claim of lack of authorization.
*   **Procedural Issues:**
    *   Failure to file Motion for Reconsideration with the CIAC was excusable because the main issue was a question of jurisdiction.
    *   Certiorari is an improper remedy for an interlocutory order (denial of motion to dismiss) *unless* the tribunal acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion, which the Court found was not present here.
*   **Remand Request:**
    *   Petitioner's non-participation was a deliberate choice. CIAC validly proceeded under its rules (Section 4.2), which allow for hearings despite a party's failure to participate.
    *   Belated action of the CA issuing a TRO and preliminary injunction did not impact validity of CIAC proceeding since its actions occurred post-decision of the CIAC.
    *   Remand was therefore unwarranted.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflicting Arbitration Clauses:** There's a potential conflict between the subcontract arbitration clause (referring to prime contract procedures or Philippine law) and the prime contract clause (specifying ICC rules). The court avoided this by relying on EO 1008â€™s principle that even if another arbitration body is named the CIAC still has jurisdiction.
*   **Lack of Authorisation:** Despite the court finding it unnecessary, lack of authorisation regarding counsel's signing of the joint motion may pose some procedural risks or challenges.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **EO 1008 (Construction Industry Arbitration Law):** Grants CIAC original and exclusive jurisdiction over construction disputes with arbitration agreements.
*   *National Irrigation Administration v. Court of Appeals*, 376 Phil. 362 (1999): Establishes that agreement to arbitration, not specific CIAC designation, is key.
*   *Philrock, Inc. v. Construction Industry Arbitration Commission*, 412 Phil. 236 (2001): Jurisdiction of the CIAC over the construction dispute was the agreement of the parties and not the Court's referral order
*   **CIAC Rules of Procedure (Section 4.2):** Allows proceedings to continue despite a party's non-participation.
*   *Lastimoso v. Asayo, G.R. No. 154243, December 4, 2007:* Respondent entitled to an appeal despite an issue with juridsiction, substantial justice should be achieved.

**Implications:**

*   This case reinforces the CIAC's broad jurisdiction over construction disputes in the Philippines, emphasizing that an arbitration clause is enough to trigger CIAC jurisdiction even if the agreement mentions a different arbitral body.
*   Parties must actively participate in CIAC proceedings; non-participation is not a basis for voiding the proceedings.
*   Challenges to CIAC jurisdiction must be raised promptly, and a clear showing of lack of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion is required to justify certiorari.
