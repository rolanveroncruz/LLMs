Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *San Lorenzo Village Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals and Almeda Development & Equipment Corporation (ADEC)* G.R. No. 116825, March 26, 1998.

**Issue:** Whether the petition filed by ADEC with the lower court states a valid cause of action against the San Lorenzo Village Association (SLVAI), such that the lower court correctly denied SLVAI's motion to dismiss.

**Facts:**

*   ADEC purchased a property within San Lorenzo Village. The Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) for the property contained restrictions, including mandatory SLVAI membership, limitations on building use (residential only, height restrictions, etc.), and easement provisions (Entry NO. 59599).
*   ADEC filed a petition to cancel the restrictions, arguing that the conditions in the area had changed (commercial establishments now exist), making the restrictions unlawful limitations on its property rights under Art. 428 of the Civil Code and not being compelled to be a member of SLVAI.
*   SLVAI moved to dismiss, asserting ADEC lacked a cause of action and legal personality to sue, arguing that ADEC was not the registered owner.
*   The lower court denied the motion to dismiss, a decision which the Court of Appeals affirmed in denying SLVAI's petition for certiorari.

**Holding & Key Provisions:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding that ADEC's complaint did state a cause of action.
*   **Cause of Action:** The Court reiterated the elements of a cause of action: (1) plaintiff's legal right, (2) defendant's correlative obligation, and (3) defendant's act/omission violating that right.
*   **Hypothetical Admission:** In a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, the court hypothetically admits the *material and relevant* facts *well-pleaded* in the complaint. This includes facts like the sale of the property to ADEC. The Court clarifies De Dios v. Bristol Laboratories (Phils.), Inc., emphasizing that legal conclusions or mere inferences are *not* admitted.
*   **Real Party-in-Interest:**  ADEC, as the successor-in-interest to the original vendor, has the prerogative to assert the vendor's rights, including challenging the restrictions on the title.
*   **Rules for Cancellation:** SLVAI's argument that only "members" (registered owners) can initiate the cancellation process may only be raised as a defense and is not grounds for a motion to dismiss.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **SLVAI:** Must litigate the merits of ADEC's claim regarding the validity and enforceability of the restrictions on the TCT, and defend the association's interest in maintaining those restrictions.
*   **ADEC:** Must prove its claim that the restrictions are unlawful and unenforceable.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Restrictions:** The core issue is the continued validity and enforceability of the deed of restrictions given the alleged changes in the surrounding environment. This will likely involve proving the extent of the changes and whether they are substantial enough to warrant cancellation.
*   **Definition of "Third Persons":** The lower courts' interpretation of "third persons" under Art. 709 of the Civil Code may be a point of contention. SLVAI could argue that it is a third person, and the unrecorded sale should not prejudice its rights.
*   **Membership:** The requirement of automatic membership in SLVAI may be challenged as an unreasonable restraint on the right to property. This could be argued as a violation of ADEC's right to choose its associations.
*   **Two-Thirds Vote:** The validity of SLVAI rules requiring a two-thirds vote of members for cancellation of restrictions is challenged.
* **Sec. 30, Presidential Decree No. 957:** ADEC stated that there is no law compelling lot and house buyers to be a member of the San Lorenzo Company, Inc. and restricting the petitioner to construct a taller building on its lot. This is used in their argument that a Deed of Restrictions annotated in a certificate of title can be cancelled.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Art. 428:** Defines the rights of an owner.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 709:** Relates to the effect of unrecorded property rights on third persons.
