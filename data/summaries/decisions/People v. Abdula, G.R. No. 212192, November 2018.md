**Case Summary: People v. Abdula, G.R. No. 212192 (November 21, 2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming the RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Art. II of R.A. No. 9165 (illegal sale of dangerous drugs - shabu) based on a buy-bust operation.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**
*   **Section 5, Art. II of R.A. No. 9165:** Illegal sale of dangerous drugs; penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 imposed by the RTC.
*   **Chain of Custody (Sec. 21, R.A. No. 9165):**  The central issue is a break in the chain of custody. Specifically, the failure to photograph the seized drugs immediately after the arrest and seizure, despite photographing other items (plastic bag, slippers), creates reasonable doubt. The prosecution failed to justify this omission, and the absence of mandatory witnesses (DOJ representative, media representative) during the marking and inventory further undermines the integrity of the evidence.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** Legitimate form of entrapment, but subject to strict procedural safeguards.
*   **Presumption of Innocence vs. Presumption of Regularity:** The Court reiterates that the presumption of innocence prevails over the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty. The burden is on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Corpus Delicti:** The dangerous drug is the corpus delicti. The failure to properly establish the chain of custody taints the identity of the corpus delicti and negates the elements of the offense.
*   **Defenses of Extortion & Frame-Up:** While jurisprudentially weak, the prosecution cannot rely on the weakness of these defenses; they must stand on the strength of their own evidence.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution:** Obligation to prove all elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt, including the integrity and identity of the corpus delicti through an unbroken chain of custody. Liable for failure to justify procedural lapses in handling evidence.
*   **Law Enforcement:** Obligation to strictly comply with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 and its IRR regarding the handling and inventory of seized drugs.
*   **Accused:**  Initially, subject to the presumption of guilt once the prosecution presented a prima facie case. However, the failure to preserve the chain of custody resulted in an acquittal.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Unexplained Omission:** The lack of a justifiable reason for not photographing the drugs raises significant doubts about their existence at the time of the arrest.
*   **Witness Requirements:** Non-compliance with the witness requirements under Section 21 further weakens the prosecution's case. The absence of a DOJ representative and media representative during inventory is a significant procedural lapse.
*   **Weak Foundation:** The judgment of conviction by lower courts was overly reliant on the inconsistencies in the defendant's testimony rather than the strength of the prosecutionâ€™s case.
*   **Application of R.A. 10640:** While R.A. 10640 allows for deviations from the prescribed procedure if there is a justifiable ground and the integrity of the seized items is preserved, this case highlights the importance of adhering to such procedure.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5 & 21**
*   **R.A. No. 10640 (Amendment to R.A. No. 9165, Section 21)**
*   Numerous cases cited regarding the presumption of innocence, presumption of regularity, chain of custody, and the elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs (see original document footnotes for complete list). Notably: *Mallillin v. People*, *People v. Mendoza*, *People v. Lim* which emphasizes the duty of law enforcers in drug cases.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and acquitted the accused due to a critical break in the chain of custody of the evidence. The lack of a justifiable reason for failing to photograph the drugs, combined with the absence of mandatory witnesses, created reasonable doubt as to the existence and integrity of the corpus delicti. This case emphasizes the importance of strict adherence to the procedural safeguards outlined in R.A. No. 9165 and R.A. No. 10640 in drug-related cases.
