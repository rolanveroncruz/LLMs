Here's a legal summary of the document:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Alejandro Atop @ “Ali”*, G.R. Nos. 124303-05, February 10, 1998.

**Nature of the Case:** Automatic review of a Regional Trial Court Joint Decision finding the accused guilty of three counts of rape. The RTC sentenced him to two terms of *reclusion perpetua* and one death sentence, the latter based on the relationship between the accused and the victim, coupled with the commission of the crime after the effectivity of R.A. 7659.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Rape (Art. 335, Revised Penal Code as amended by RA 7659):** Defines rape and its penalties, including the imposition of death under certain aggravated circumstances.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances (Art. 14, Revised Penal Code, specifically Paragraph 3 regarding relationship and Par. 6 regarding nighttime):** Affect the penalty to be imposed.
*   **Civil Liability (Art. 100, Revised Penal Code):** Establishes that a person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly liable.
*   **Moral Damages (Arts. 2217 & 2219, Civil Code):** Addresses compensation for mental anguish, etc.

**Facts:**

*   The accused, Alejandro Atop, was convicted of raping his common-law partner's granddaughter (Regina Guafin) on three separate occasions.
*   The trial court considered the "relationship" (live-in partner of victim's grandmother) and nighttime as aggravating circumstances.
*   The last rape incident occurred after R.A. 7659 (death penalty law) came into effect.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether the trial court erred in appreciating the circumstances of nighttime and relationship as aggravating the penalty.
2.  Whether the evidence presented was sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Ruling:**

*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The Supreme Court held that nighttime was not proven to have been deliberately sought to facilitate the crime. The Court overturned the lower court's judgment that relationship as defined in the Revised Penal Code only covers spouse, ascendant, descendant, legitimate, natural or adopted brother or sister, or a relative by affinity. The court also held that sec. 11 of RA 7659 applies only when the victim is under eighteen years old and offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:**  The Court affirmed the accused's guilt based on the victim's credible testimony, despite inconsistencies between her initial affidavit and court testimony, which were adequately explained due to initial fear of the accused.
*   **Penalty:**  Because the aggravating circumstances did not stand, the Court modified the death sentence to *reclusion perpetua* for the third count of rape as well. The Court further increased the civil indemnity for each count of rape to P50,000 and affirmed the award of P50,000 in moral damages.

**Liabilities and Obligations:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** The accused is criminally liable for three counts of rape.
*   **Civil Liability:** The accused is civilly liable for P150,000 in total indemnity (P50,000 per count) and P50,000 in moral damages to the victim.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses/Case Law:**

*   **Interpretation of "Relationship":**  The key legal risk revolves around the interpretation of "relationship" as an aggravating circumstance under Art. 15 of the Revised Penal Code and Sec. 11 of RA 7659.  The Court narrowly construes this, emphasizing the need for strict interpretation of penal laws in favor of the accused (citing *People vs. Subido, People vs. Yu Jai*, etc.). The court cites *People v. Balondo* and *People v. Lamberte* to define affinity.
*   **Discrepancy in Testimony:** The accused argued on the victim's inconsistent testimonies, which is a common defense strategy in rape cases, highlighting the importance of witness credibility.
*   **Credibility of Witness Testimony:** The decision emphasizes the importance of the trial court's assessment of witness demeanor and credibility.
