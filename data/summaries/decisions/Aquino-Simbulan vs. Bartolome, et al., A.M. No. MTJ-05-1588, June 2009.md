**Case Summary: *Judge Divina Luz P. Aquino-Simbulan v. Judge Nicasio Bartolome, et al.*** (A.M. No. MTJ-05-1588, June 5, 2009)

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against a judge and court personnel for irregularities in processing a surety bond.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Procedural Violation:** Judge Bartolome (MTC, Sta. Maria, Bulacan) improperly approved a surety bond for an accused, Mercado, whose case was pending in RTC Pampanga, violating Section 17, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court. Mercado was not arrested, and the bond should have been filed with the RTC where the case was pending.
*   **Defective Documentation:** The judge approved the bond without required documentation (Certificate of Detention, Warrant of Arrest) and with belatedly filed supporting papers.
*   **Clerk of Court's Negligence:** Clerk of Court Lerey admitted to misplacing and overlooking the surety bond, causing delays. She also failed to explain erasures on the bond, violating Section 1, Canon IV of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel.
*   **Investigation Findings:** An investigating judge found Judge Bartolome negligent in his duty to supervise his court employees and Lerey grossly negligent in her duties. The charges were dismissed against Pascual and Dela Cruz.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) found Judge Bartolome in violation of Section 17, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court and recommended a fine. It found Lerey guilty of gross misconduct and recommended a fine as well.

**Obligations:**

*   Judge Bartolome had a duty to adhere to procedural rules regarding bail and supervise court personnel (Code of Judicial Conduct, Rules 3.08 & 3.09).
*   Clerk of Court Lerey had a duty to perform official duties diligently and ensure an orderly record management system (Section 1, Canon IV of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel).

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Bartolome was found guilty of **Gross Neglect of Duty**.
*   Clerk of Court Lerey was found guilty of **Gross Neglect of Duty**.

**Penalties:**

*   Both Judge Bartolome and Clerk of Court Lerey (both retired) were fined P40,000 each, to be deducted from their retirement benefits.  A previous fine of P10,000 was imposed on Lerey for indirect contempt.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Issues:**

*   **Reliance on Staff:** Judge Bartolome argued reliance on the Clerk of Court's experience, but this did not absolve him of supervisory responsibilities. The court cited *Bellena v. Judge Perello* (A.M. No. RTJ-04-1846) to support the principle of supervisory responsibility.
*   **Retroactive Application of Fines**: The penalties were applied after retirement, deducted from retirement benefits.  This raises questions about due process and whether retirement extinguishes liability for administrative offenses. The Court cited *Moncada v. Cervantes, Office of the Court Administrator v. Paredes, and Soria v. Oliveros* in issuing its penalty.
*   **Gross Neglect Definition:** The decision relies on the definition of gross neglect of duty under the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, which includes a degree of seriousness that endangers public welfare. This seems to be the rationale for the severe penalty. The Ulat-Marrero v. Torio Jr case was cited in the decision to determine the appropriate penalty.
