## Legal Document Summary: *Lansangan v. Caisip* (G.R. No. 212987)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's motu proprio dismissal of a Complaint for Sum of Money and Damages.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in upholding the motu proprio dismissal of the complaint due to failure to undergo prior barangay conciliation proceedings as required under RA 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *granted* the Petition, *reversed* the CA's Decision, and *remanded* the case to the MCTC for resolution on the merits.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sec. 412(a), RA 7160:** Pre-condition to filing a complaint in court requires confrontation before the *lupon* chairman or *pangkat* for matters within the *lupon*'s authority.
*   **Sec. 409(a), RA 7160:** Disputes between actual residents of the same *barangay* should be brought for amicable settlement before the *lupon*.
*   **Rule 16, Sec. 1(j), Rules of Court:** Failure to comply with a condition precedent for filing a claim (like barangay conciliation) is a ground for dismissal.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Plaintiff (Lansangan):** Initially, the case was dismissed due to her failure to comply with the barangay conciliation requirement. However, the SC reversed, thus reinstating her claim against the defendant
*   **Defendant (Caisip):** Declared in default for failure to file a responsive pleading. May be held liable for the amount claimed under the promissory note if Plaintiff prevails in the resolution of the case.
*   **Trial Court:** Erred in dismissing the case *motu proprio* on grounds not raised by the Defendant. The risk of reversal on appeal highlights the importance of proper application of procedural rules and timely raising of objections.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991):** Sections 408, 409, and 412 are central to the dispute.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1508 (Katarungang Pambarangay Law):** Establishes the barangay conciliation system.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 9, Sec. 1 & Rule 16, Sec. 1(j):** Govern dismissal grounds and waiver of defenses.
*   ***Aquino v. Aure, 569 Phil. 403 (2008):***  Clarifies that barangay conciliation is a *condition precedent*, not a jurisdictional requirement, and can be waived.  Addresses the effect of non-compliance and the timing of objections.
*   ***Banares II v. Balising, 384 Phil. 567 (2000):*** Non-referral of a case for barangay conciliation when so required under the law is not jurisdictional in nature.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The central contention revolves around whether the failure to undergo barangay conciliation deprives the court of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court cites *Aquino v. Aure* to clarify this is *not* jurisdictional, but a condition precedent that can be waived. The lack of a responsive pleading from the Defendant effectively waived this requirement in this specific case.
