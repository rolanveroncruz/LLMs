## Legal Document Summary: *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company vs. Junnel's Marketing Corporation* (G.R. No. 235511 & 235565)

**Nature:** Consolidated appeals concerning liability for unauthorized payment of crossed checks.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner/Respondent:** Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (Metrobank) - Drawee Bank
*   **Petitioner/Respondent:** Bank of Commerce (Bankcom) - Collecting Bank
*   **Respondent/Plaintiff:** Junnel's Marketing Corporation (JMC) - Drawer
*   **Respondent:** Purificacion Delizo (Delizo) - Former JMC Accountant (alleged thief)

**Facts:**

JMC issued crossed checks payable to Jardine and Premiere. These checks were deposited into a Bankcom account not belonging to either payee. Delizo allegedly stole the checks and colluded with others to deposit and encash them. Metrobank honored the checks, debiting JMC's account. JMC sued Metrobank, Bankcom, and Delizo to recover the amount of the checks.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Drawee Bank Liability (Metrobank):** The Supreme Court (SC) reiterated the principle from *Bank of America v. Associated Citizens Bank* (G.R. Nos. 141001 & 141018), holding Metrobank *strictly liable* to JMC for the unauthorized payment of the checks.  A drawee bank has a contractual duty to pay only the payee or the payee's order (Art. 1980, Civil Code). Paying someone else constitutes a breach. The court affirmed the trial court's decision to absolve Delizo, finding no evidence proving her involvement in the crime.
*   **Collecting Bank Liability (Bankcom):** Bankcom, as the collecting bank, is liable to reimburse Metrobank. Bankcom's presentation of the checks for payment constitutes an endorsement, warranting the genuineness of prior endorsements and good title (Section 66, Negotiable Instruments Law). The stamped tracer ID band on the checks proves Bankcom's involvement. The SC rejected Bankcom's argument that the failure to stamp "ALL PRIOR ENDORSEMENTS AND/OR LACK OF ENDORSEMENT GUARANTEED" on all checks absolves it from liability. Section 17 of PCHC Rules and Regulations expressly states that checks "cleared through the PCHC" that do not bear the mentioned guarantees shall nonetheless "be deemed guaranteed by the [collecting bank] as to all prior endorsements and/or lack of endorsement"
*   **Sequential Liability:** The SC reversed the Court of Appeals ruling that apportions liability between Metrobank and Bankcom on a 2/3 to 1/3 ratio. Citing *Bank of America v. Associated Citizens Bank*, the SC ordered *sequential* liability: Metrobank is primarily liable to JMC, and Bankcom is liable to reimburse Metrobank.
*   **Rejection of Comparative Negligence:** The SC rejected the application of comparative negligence as the negligence of the drawee bank in the cases of *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Court of Appeals* and *Allied Banking Corporation v. Lio Sim Wan* is not attributed to Metrobank in the present case.
*   **Interest:** Metrobank's liability to JMC is subject to 6% interest per annum from the date of filing the complaint (January 28, 2002). Bankcom's liability to Metrobank is subject to 6% interest per annum from the date of Metrobank's cross-claim (March 5, 2003), following *Nacar v. Gallery Frames*.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Recourse of Bankcom:** The SC acknowledges that Bankcom should have recourse against the individuals who caused the wrongful deposit but, as they were not impleaded, the court cannot rule on this. This leaves Bankcom with a potential separate cause of action.
*   **Burden of Proof:**  While Delizo was absolved due to lack of evidence, future actions against other involved parties may require a higher burden of proof to link them to the fraudulent scheme.

**Key Statutory References:**

*   **Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL):** Section 66 (Endorser's liability), and its warranty provisions.
*   **Civil Code:** Article 1980 (Bank deposits as loans).
*   **PCHC Rules and Regulations:** Section 17 (Bank Guarantee)
