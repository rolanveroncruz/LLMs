**Case Summary: Arrieta v. Arrieta, G.R. No. 234808 (November 19, 2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA Decision which annulled the RTC's declaration of nullity of marriage.

**Facts:** Crescencio (Cris) and Melania Arrieta married. Melania left for the US in 1991, obtained a divorce in 1992, and remarried in 1993. Cris filed for declaration of nullity in 2001 based on Melania's psychological incapacity (Article 36, Family Code). Summons was served by publication. RTC declared the marriage void ab initio in 2004. Melania filed a Petition for Annulment of Judgment in the CA in 2012.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** Psychological incapacity as grounds for declaration of nullity of marriage.
*   **Rule 47, Rules of Court:** Annulment of Judgments: Grounds are extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction. Denial of due process, specifically defective service of summons, is considered a jurisdictional defect.
*   **Section 15, Rule 14, Rules of Court:** Extraterritorial Service of Summons: (1) personal service, (2) publication and registered mail to last known address, (3) "any other manner the court may deem sufficient."
*   **Main Issue:** Whether the CA erred in granting Melania's petition for annulment of judgment based on defective service of summons and denial of due process.

**Court's Holding:** CA erred. RTC's method of service (publication only) was permissible under Section 15, Rule 14 ("any other manner the court may deem sufficient") given the circumstances. Melania was estranged, resided abroad, and Cris lacked knowledge of her current address. The RTC's order for publication is presumed regular, absent evidence to the contrary. Further, Melania's petition for annulment of judgment was barred by laches (Section 3, Rule 47).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Plaintiff (Cris):** Had the obligation to properly serve summons on the Defendant (Melania).
*   **Defendant (Melania):** Had a duty to assert her rights within a reasonable time, which she failed to do, leading to laches.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity in Service:** The order specified service "by publication...pursuant to Section 15, Rule 14." However, it was not explicitly stated *which* method in Rule 14 was used. This lack of precision initially led to the CA ruling against Cris.
*   **"Newspaper of General Circulation":** The CA questioned whether the *San Pedro Express* qualified as a general circulation newspaper, but the Supreme Court rejected this challenge citing the presumption of regularity. However, failing to adequately establish the newspaper's circulation could have been fatal.
*   **Laches:** The success of the laches argument hinged on proving Melania's knowledge of the proceedings despite the alleged defective service. Establishing her knowledge after several years required strong evidence.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Melania had the burden of proving irregularity in the service of summons to overcome the presumption of regularity of the courtâ€™s actions.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** Definition of psychological incapacity.
*   **Section 15, Rule 14, Rules of Court:** Guidelines for extraterritorial service of summons.
*   **Rule 47, Rules of Court:** Annulment of Judgments.
*   **De Pedro v. Romasan Development Corporation, 748 Phil. 706 (2014):** Affirms that defective service of summons constitutes a jurisdictional defect remediable by annulment of judgment and ties denial of due process to lack of jurisdiction.
*   **Romualdez-Licaros v. Licaros, 449 Phil. 824 (2003):** Illustrates extraterritorial service under the "any other manner" clause.
*   **Yap v. Lagtapon, G.R. No. 196347, January 23, 2017:** Reinforces the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties.
