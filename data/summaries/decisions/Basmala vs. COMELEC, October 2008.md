**Case Summary: Basmala v. COMELEC (G.R. No. 176724, October 6, 2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64 assailing COMELEC Resolutions reversing an RTC decision in an election protest.

**Facts:** Petitioner Basmala (Basmala) and Respondent Sumagayan (Sumagayan) were mayoral candidates. Sumagayan was initially proclaimed winner. Basmala filed an election protest in RTC, which was granted. RTC declared Basmala as the duly elected mayor after rejecting election returns from 5 precincts. Sumagayan appealed to COMELEC, which reversed the RTC decision and reinstated Sumagayan's victory, finding the evidence insufficient to invalidate the election returns. COMELEC en banc affirmed. Basmala then filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Mootness:** SC ultimately dismissed the petition on the ground of mootness due to the expiration of the contested term and the election of new officials. *Albaña v. COMELEC*, 478 Phil. 941, 949 (2004); *Trinidad v. COMELEC*, 373 Phil. 802, 812-813 (1999).
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The Court also ruled that COMELEC did not commit grave abuse of discretion. SC stressed COMELEC's role as a specialized agency for election matters.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The COMELEC held that Basmala failed to present sufficient evidence to prove massive fraud to justify the invalidation of returns, especially since the testimonies of witnesses were considered self-serving. The COMELEC relied on the testimonies of the BEI chairs indicating orderly and peaceful elections.
*   **Factual Findings of COMELEC:** The court acknowledged that the findings of fact of the COMELEC, when supported by substantial evidence, are final, non-reviewable, and binding. *Idulza v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 160130, April 14, 2004, 427 SCRA 701, 707-708.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Burden of Proof:**  The case underscores the protestant's (Basmala) heavy burden to prove allegations of fraud and irregularities affecting election results.  Mere allegations and self-serving testimonies are insufficient.
*   **COMELEC's Duty:** The COMELEC has the duty to examine election documents, records of protest and evidence submitted by parties.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Self-Serving Testimony:** Heavy reliance on testimonies of relatives and watchers can be problematic.
*   **Substantial Evidence:** The definition of "substantial evidence" in election protest cases is crucial.  This case underscores the need for concrete evidence beyond mere allegations or the testimony of biased witnesses.
*   **Mootness doctrine:** Even with an actual grave abuse of discretion, the Supreme Court can dismiss the case due to mootness.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   Rule 64, Rules of Court (Certiorari)
*   *Albaña v. COMELEC*, 478 Phil. 941, 949 (2004) - Mootness
*   *Trinidad v. COMELEC*, 373 Phil. 802, 812-813 (1999) - Mootness
*   *Idulza v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 160130, April 14, 2004, 427 SCRA 701, 707-708 - COMELEC factual findings

*   *Punzalan v. COMELEC*, 352 Phil. 538, 552 (1998) - appreciation of election documents
*   *Juan v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 166639, April 24, 2007, 522 SCRA 119, 128 - SC is not trier of facts

**Conclusion:** This case serves as a reminder of the high evidentiary standard in election protests, the finality of COMELEC's factual findings when supported by substantial evidence, and the Court's reluctance to overturn these findings absent grave abuse of discretion. It also demonstrates the practical impact of the mootness doctrine in election cases.
