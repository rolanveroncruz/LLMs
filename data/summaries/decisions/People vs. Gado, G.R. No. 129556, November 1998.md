## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Gado*, G.R. No. 129556 (1998)

**Case Overview:** This is an appeal by Rey Gado of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting him of murder for the stabbing death of Melencio Manalang, Jr. Gado's co-accused, Emma Gallos, was acquitted.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction based on Dying Declaration:** The Supreme Court (SC) upholds the conviction, primarily relying on the victim's statements to his father, Melencio Manalang, Sr., identifying Gado as his assailant. The SC finds these statements admissible as a dying declaration.
*   **Dying Declaration Requirements Met:** The court determined that the four requisites for a valid dying declaration are present, the statements concern the cause and surrounding circumstances of the victim's death; the victim believed his death was imminent; the declarant was competent as a witness; and the declaration is offered in a criminal case for homicide, murder or parricide, in which the declarant is a victim.
*   **Alternative Basis: Res Gestae:** Even if the dying declaration was not proper, the SC finds the victim's statements admissible as part of the *res gestae*, made shortly after the startling event (the stabbing) and before the victim had the opportunity to fabricate.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** The SC affirms the finding of treachery, noting that the attack was sudden and unexpected, with the victim being held while stabbed, denying him any chance to defend himself. This qualified the killing as murder.
*   **Alibi Rejected:** Gado's alibi was deemed weak and insufficient to overcome the prosecution's evidence.
*   **Damages Modified:** The SC modifies the RTC's award of actual damages, reducing it from P50,000 to P23,217.65, based on documented expenses. The P50,000 civil indemnity was upheld.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Gado's Obligation:** To serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for the crime of murder.
*   **Gado's Liability:** To pay civil indemnity of P50,000 and actual damages of P23,217.65 to the heirs of the victim.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Retracted Eyewitness Testimony:** The initial reliance on Fernando Reyes's affidavit is potentially problematic due to his retraction. However, the SC justifies the conviction based on the dying declaration and the finding of treachery.
*   **Consciousness of Impending Death:** Accused-appellant argued that, the victim's statements were not made under a clear consciousness of an impending death, the SC disagreed noting the serious nature of his wounds.
*   **Proof of Treachery:** The determination of treachery hinges on witness testimony regarding the manner of the attack (victim being held). Scrutinizing these accounts for consistency and credibility would be important.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes murder.
*   **Rules of Evidence:**  The decision heavily relies on the Rules of Evidence regarding admissibility of dying declarations and *res gestae* statements. The court cited *People vs. Israel, 231 SCRA 155 (1994)* and *People vs. Lazarte, 200 SCRA 361 (1991)* with regard to dying declaration.
*   **Jurisprudence on Credibility of Witnesses:** The SC defers to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, citing *People vs. Cabiles, G.R. No. 112035, January 16, 1998; People vs. Moran, 241 SCRA 709 (1995); People vs. Gamiao, 240 SCRA 254 (1995)*.
*   **Case Law on Alibi:** *People vs. Esquilona, 248 SCRA 139 (1995)* is cited regarding the requirement for an alibi to be credible.
*   **Case Law on Actual Damages:** *del Mundo vs. Court of Appeals, 240 SCRA 3348 (1995)* is cited regarding the need for proof of actual damages.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The exact details of the physical restraint applied to the victim during the stabbing are not explicitly detailed in the summary, which could be a point of contention regarding the establishment of treachery. Further review of the original court records for precise descriptions is warranted.
