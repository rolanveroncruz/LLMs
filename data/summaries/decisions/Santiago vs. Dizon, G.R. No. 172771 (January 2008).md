**Case Summary: *Sps. Santiago vs. Dizon*, G.R. No. 172771 (2008)**

**Legal Issue:** Whether the transaction between Respondent Dizon and Petitioners Santiagos constituted a *pacto de retro* sale (sale with right of repurchase) or an equitable mortgage.

**Facts:** Respondent mortgaged property to Monte de Piedad, which was foreclosed. Petitioners advanced funds to Respondent to repurchase the property from the bank.  Subsequently, Respondent executed a deed of sale to Petitioners with an option for Respondent to repurchase within three months at a significantly higher price. When Respondent failed to repurchase, Petitioners sought ejectment, which was initially granted, then reversed, and eventually the Supreme Court allowed the ejectment but allowed a separate action to determine ownership. Respondent then filed for reformation of the deed of sale, claiming it was an equitable mortgage securing a loan.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and Regional Trial Court decisions, holding that the transaction was a bona fide *pacto de retro* sale, not an equitable mortgage. Reformation of the deed of sale was therefore improper.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Respondent's Argument:** The original deed of sale should be reformed into an equitable mortgage because:
    *   The price was inadequate considering the property's location.
    *   Respondent retained possession after the sale.
    *   The "repurchase price" was significantly higher than the original sale price, indicating an intention to secure a loan with interest.
    *   Respondent allegedly continued to exercise rights of ownership.

*   **Petitioners' Argument:** The transaction was a bona fide *pacto de retro* sale, supported by evidence:
    *   Petitioners received rentals from the property after the repurchase option expired.
    *   Petitioners paid the realty taxes.
    *   The initial sale price was not inadequate compared to the assessed value of the property.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1602 of the Civil Code:** Establishes presumptions for when a contract shall be presumed to be an equitable mortgage: unusually inadequate price; vendor remaining in possession; granting of a new redemption period; purchaser retains part of price; or vendor bound to pay taxes on thing sold.
*   **Article 1603 of the Civil Code:** States that in case of doubt, a contract purporting to be a sale with right of repurchase shall be construed as an equitable mortgage.

**Case Law:**

*   ** *Bundalian v. Court of Appeals*:**  Distinguished by the Court. In *Bundalian*, the escalating repurchase price reinforced the presumption of an equitable mortgage. Here, there was a fixed repurchase price and date, and the respondent did not have the right to build on the property, distinguishing it from *Bundalian*.
*   **General Principle of Equitable Mortgage:** The Court acknowledges that the presumption of an equitable mortgage under Article 1602 is not conclusive and can be rebutted by sufficient evidence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   The **fixed "repurchase price" of P900,000**, significantly higher than the original purchase price of P550,000, initially supported Respondent's claim of an equitable mortgage. However, the Court deemed this insufficient to outweigh other evidence.
*   The **short timeframe** of three months for repurchase could have been argued as further evidence of an intent to secure a loan.
*   While the court determined that the *pacto de retro* sale was valid, there is always a risk in such arrangements because Article 1603 presumes an equitable mortgage. The case hinged on the petitioners proving, through evidence of tax payments, rental collection, and the assessed value of the property, that it was in fact, a valid sale with an option to repurchase.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent:** Obligated to vacate the premises and transfer possession, as the repurchase option was not exercised. No liability for a debt secured by an equitable mortgage as none was found to exist.
*   **Petitioners:**  Entitled to possession and ownership of the property.
