**Summary of *Felix and Cabreros v. Atty. Gadon*, A.C. No. 13253 (Feb. 27, 2024)**

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint for Disbarment filed by Felix and Cabreros (both PLHIV advocates) against Atty. Gadon for statements made on DWIZ's *Karambola* (June 24, 2021) and DZRD's *Ang Maestro* (June 27, 2021) regarding the death of former President Aquino.

**Key Provisions and Allegations:**

*   **Statements:** Atty. Gadon made derogatory remarks about President Aquino ("putang ina," "hayop") upon news of his death, expressed glee ("Yehey!"), wished him "rest in hell," and speculated without basis that Aquino died of HIV.  He also denigrated PLHIVs and threatened those who would sue him for his remarks.
*   **Complainants' Argument:**  Atty. Gadon's statements violated Canons 1 and 7 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA) and discriminated against PLHIVs, exacerbating stigma and misinformation. They violated several portions of Canon II of the CPRA, specifically Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Atty. Gadon admitted to the statements but argued they were protected speech, aimed at a public figure (Aquino), and made without malice. He further argued the complainants lacked standing as the remarks targeted Aquino and the statements were made in his private capacity.

**Ruling:** Atty. Gadon found GUILTY of violating the CPRA.  Given his prior disbarment in *In Re: Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon's Viral Video Against Ms. Raissa Robles*, A.C. No. 13521 (June 27, 2023), the penalty of disbarment cannot be imposed again, but the infraction is to be recorded in his personal file. A fine of PHP 150,000.00 is imposed.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Gadon violated the CPRA by engaging in undignified, abusive, and scandalous conduct, failing to respect the dignity of the legal profession, and spreading misinformation.
*   Lawyers are held to a high standard of conduct in both public and private life (*Valin v. Atty. Ruiz*, 820 Phil. 390 (2017); *Belo-Henares v. Atty. Guevarra*, 801 Phil. 570 (2016)).
*   Lawyers must use dignified, gender-fair, child- and culturally-sensitive language (Canon II, Sec. 4, CPRA).

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA):**  A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC (April 11, 2023), Canon II, Sec. 1,2,3,4 and 5
*   **Disbarment proceedings are *sui generis*:** *Gonzalez v. Atty. Alcaraz*, 534 Phil. 471 (2006), making lack of a real party-in-interest no bar to the proceedings. *Mejares v. Atty. Romana*, 469 Phil. 619 (2004)
*   **Conduct in private dealings**: *Valin v. Atty. Ruiz*, 820 Phil. 390 (2017). *Belo-Henares v. Atty. Guevarra*, 801 Phil. 570 (2016)
*    **Penalty When the Respondent Has been Previously Disbarred**: SECTION 42. Canon VI of the CPRA
*   **Prior Suspension/Disbarment:** Cites *Mendoza v. Atty. Gadon*, A.C. No. 11810 (Resolution), August 19, 2019; *In Re: Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon's Viral Video Against Ms. Raissa Robles*, A.C. No. 13521, June 27, 2023. Also lists pending cases against Atty. Gadon.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Judicial Clemency:** Although disbarred, Atty. Gadon may apply for judicial clemency in the future; this recorded infraction will be considered.

**Conclusion:**

The Court strongly condemns Atty. Gadon's conduct as unbecoming of a lawyer, especially his discriminatory remarks against PLHIVs. Despite the inability to disbar him again, the significant fine and record of the infraction underscore the severity of his actions and serves as a deterrent against similar misconduct. The case reinforces the higher standard of conduct expected of lawyers, both in their professional and personal lives.
