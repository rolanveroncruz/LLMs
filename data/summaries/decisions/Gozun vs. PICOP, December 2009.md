## Legal Document Summary: *Hon. Heherson Alvarez vs. PICOP Resources, Inc.*

**Case Citation:** 621 Phil. 403 (G.R. Nos. 162243, 164516, 171875, December 3, 2009)

**Nature of Document:** Resolution denying PICOP's Motion for Reconsideration of a prior Supreme Court Decision reversing the CA and RTC, ultimately denying PICOP's Petition for Mandamus.

**Key Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)
*   **Respondent:** PICOP Resources, Inc. (PICOP)

**Background:** PICOP sought a writ of mandamus to compel the DENR Secretary to issue an Integrated Forest Management Agreement (IFMA) converting its Timber License Agreement (TLA) No. 43, relying on a 1969 Presidential Warranty from Ferdinand Marcos. The RTC and CA initially ruled in favor of PICOP, but the Supreme Court reversed.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **1969 Presidential Warranty:** The central issue is whether the 1969 Document constitutes a legally binding contract enforceable under the Non-Impairment Clause (Article III, Section 10 of the Constitution).
    *   **SC Ruling:** The SC holds that the 1969 Document is NOT a contract; rather, it is merely a *collateral undertaking* that does not amplify PICOP's rights under its timber license. The TLA itself is a license, which is *not* a contract and can be validly withdrawn.
    *   **Case Law:** The decision cites *Oposa v. Factoran* and *Felipe Ysmael, Jr. & Co., Inc. vs. Deputy Executive Secretary*, reinforcing the principle that timber licenses are not contracts protected by the non-impairment clause. The court also references PICOP Resources, Inc. v. Base Metals Mineral Resources Corporation, which similarly found that the Presidential Warranty is not a contract.
    *   **Contentious Clause:** The "renewable for another 25 years" clause is contentious. PICOP argues it provides a long-term guarantee. The SC interprets it as subject to constitutional and statutory requirements, including the time limitations set on agreements for the utilization of natural resources.
*   **Mandamus Requirements:** The remedy of mandamus is only available to compel the performance of a *ministerial duty*. The SC states that the execution of an IFMA involves discretion.
*   **Compliance with IFMA Requirements:** The decision addresses whether PICOP complied with the statutory and administrative requirements for converting its TLA into an IFMA under DAO 99-53.
    *   **NCIP Certification (Section 59 of RA 8371 - IPRA):** PICOP's failure to obtain certification from the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) that the area does not overlap with any ancestral domain was a key deficiency. The SC emphasizes this requirement.
    *   **Sanggunian Consultation & Approval (Sections 26 & 27 of the Local Government Code):** PICOP failed to obtain prior approval from *all* Sanggunians concerned, as its TLA traverses several provinces. The court confirms it is a requirement. PICOP attempts to argue that the LGC's consultation requirement is not applicable.
    *   **Forest Protection & Reforestation Plans:** The SC withdraws its original pronouncement that PICOP had not submitted those plans, due to lack of dispute from DENR on its existence.
    *   **Forest Charges:** The SC withdraws its pronouncement that PICOP had unpaid forestry charges. The original testimony was based on hearsay evidence.
*   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** By filing a Petition for Mandamus instead of appealing to the Office of the President, PICOP failed to exhaust all administrative remedies.
*   **Constitutional Issues:** The Court emphasized that granting PICOP perpetual and exclusive possession of forest lands violates Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution (ownership of natural resources).
*   **Investment Incentives Act:** The court rejected PICOP's claim that the issuance of the 1969 Document was brought about by the Investment Incentives Act and as such made it a contractual duty.

**Obligations:**

*   PICOP has an obligation to comply with all statutory and administrative requirements, including obtaining an NCIP certification and Sanggunian approvals, for any future application for resource utilization.
*   DENR has the obligation to comply with all statutory requirements in reviewing applications.

**Liabilities:**

*   PICOP has no immediate liability. The court reversed the award of damages.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future IFMA Application:** Any future attempt by PICOP to obtain an IFMA will be subject to strict scrutiny and compliance with all current legal and administrative requirements.
*   **Erosion of Tenurial Security:** The ruling reinforces the principle that timber licenses are not contracts, potentially undermining the perceived tenurial security of similar concession holders.
*   **Constitutional Challenge to Future Agreements:** Any IFMA grant would likely be subject to public scrutiny and potential legal challenge based on constitutional limitations regarding resource utilization agreements.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **Constitution:** Article III, Section 10 (Non-Impairment Clause); Article XII, Section 2 (Ownership of Natural Resources)
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 65 (Mandamus)
*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1305, 1350, 4
*   **IPRA (RA 8371):** Section 3(a), 59
*   **Local Government Code:** Sections 2(c), 26, 27
*   **Investment Incentives Act (RA 5186):** Section 2, 4(d), (e)
*   **Presidential Decree No. 705**
*   **Executive Order No. 192**
*   **DENR Administrative Order No. 99-53:** (IFMA definition and requirements)
*   **Cases:** *Oposa v. Factoran*, *Felipe Ysmael, Jr. & Co., Inc. vs. Deputy Executive Secretary*, *PICOP Resources, Inc. v. Base Metals Mineral Resources Corporation*, *Tan v. Director of Forestry*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of the 1969 Presidential Warranty, particularly the renewal clause and its enforceability in light of subsequent constitutional provisions and environmental concerns.
*   The definition of "project" or "program" under Section 27 of the Local Government Code and whether it includes private activities related to natural resource exploitation.

**Overall Assessment:** The decision represents a strong affirmation of the State's control and supervision over natural resources, limiting the enforceability of agreements that potentially circumvent constitutional limitations. It underscores the importance of compliance with current regulations and the protection of indigenous rights and local government interests in resource utilization.
