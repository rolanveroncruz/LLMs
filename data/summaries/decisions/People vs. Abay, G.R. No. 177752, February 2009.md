## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Abay* (G.R. No. 177752)

This Supreme Court decision affirms with modification the Court of Appeals (CA) ruling, finding Roberto Abay y Trinidad (Appellant) guilty of rape under Article 266-A(1)(a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) and sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*. The case originates from an Information charging Appellant with rape in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act), for incidents occurring in December 1999 involving the victim AAA, then 13 years old.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Offense:** Simple rape under Article 266-A(1)(a) RPC (carnal knowledge through force and intimidation). The initial charge included reference to RA 7610, but the Court clarifies that rape and RA 7610 cannot be complexed, citing Article 48 RPC and *People v. Araneta*.
*   **Penalty:** *Reclusion perpetua*. The RTC originally imposed the death penalty, which was modified due to RA 9346 (prohibiting the death penalty).
*   **Damages:** P75,000 civil indemnity *ex-delicto*, P75,000 moral damages, and P25,000 exemplary damages. Moral damages are automatically granted in rape cases (*People v. Alvarez*).

**Obligations:**

*   Appellant is obligated to serve his sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Appellant is obligated to pay damages as specified by the Court.

**Liabilities:**

*   Appellant is criminally liable for the offense of rape.
*   Appellant is civilly liable for the damages awarded.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Original Information:** The Information initially charged Appellant with rape in relation to Section 5(b) of RA 7610. While the court ultimately prosecutes for rape, the inclusion of the elements of both crimes could lead to confusion or potentially, a double jeopardy argument if not properly distinguished (*People v. Optana*; CONSTITUTION, Art. III, Sec. 21). The Court addressed the improper complexing of offenses, but careful examination of the charge and supporting evidence is required.
*   **Victim's Age:** While the Information stated the victim was 13 at the time of the incident, one witness, BBB testified that AAA was over 12 years old; however, her exact age was not proven. The court addressed this adequately in reference to the information alleging her age. If the victim had been under 12, the charge would have been statutory rape under Article 266-A(1)(d) RPC per the citation of Section 5(b) of RA 7610 in relation to RA 8353.
*   **Evidence Considerations:** The court relied heavily on the victim's testimony and the mother's corroboration. The defense presented alibi evidence. The decision emphasizes the credibility of the victim and the RTC's findings regarding the appellant's behavior after accusation. This opens up the possibility of challenging the factual basis of the conviction should new evidence come to light.
*   **Bladed Instrument:** The decision mentions the appellant used a bladed instrument to threaten the victim but the specific type of weapon used was not mentioned in the records.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:** Articles 266-A (Rape), 266-B (Penalties for Rape), Article 48 (Complex Crimes).
*   **Republic Act No. 7610:** Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act, specifically Section 5(b).
