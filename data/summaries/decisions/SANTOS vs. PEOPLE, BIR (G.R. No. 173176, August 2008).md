Okay, here's a summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted for legal precision:

**Case:** *Judy Anne L. Santos v. People of the Philippines and Bureau of Internal Revenue*, G.R. No. 173176, August 26, 2008 (585 Phil. 337)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, challenging the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) *en banc*'s denial of a Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review. The intended Petition for Review sought to appeal the CTA First Division's Resolutions denying Santos's Motion to Quash an Information filed against her for violation of Sections 255, 254, and 248(B) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), as amended.

**Facts:** The BIR, through Commissioner Parayno, referred Santos to the DOJ for preliminary investigation and possible prosecution for substantial underdeclaration of income for taxable year 2002, constituting prima facie evidence of a false or fraudulent return under Section 248(B) of the NIRC. The DOJ found probable cause and filed an Information with the CTA. Santos filed a Motion to Quash, arguing lack of jurisdiction, lack of authority of the filing officer, and failure of the Information to state an offense. The CTA First Division denied the Motion. The CTA *en banc* denied Santos's Motion for Extension to appeal this denial.

**Issue:** Whether a Resolution of a CTA Division denying a motion to quash is a proper subject of an appeal to the CTA *en banc* under Section 18 of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended by Republic Act No. 9282.

**Holding:** No. The Supreme Court denied the petition, holding that the CTA *en banc* correctly denied the Motion for Extension. An order denying a motion to quash is interlocutory and not immediately appealable.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Interlocutory Order:** The Court reiterated the established rule that denial of a motion to quash is an interlocutory order, not a final order subject to immediate appeal. Citing Section 1, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Proper Remedy:** The appropriate remedy for denial of a motion to quash is to proceed to trial and, if convicted, appeal the final judgment.
*   **RA 1125 & RA 9282:**  While RA 9282 expanded the jurisdiction of the CTA and allowed appeals from CTA Division decisions to the CTA *en banc*, this did not alter the fundamental principle that interlocutory orders are not appealable.
*   **Petition for Certiorari:**  While acknowledging that a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 could be an available remedy to correct grave abuse of discretion, excess of jurisdiction, or errors of law, the Court found no such abuse in this case.
*   **Authority to File Information:** The Court rejected Santos's argument that the Information was improperly filed because the BIR Commissioner's prior approval was sufficient and did not need to appear on the information itself. Citing Section 220 of the NIRC.
*   **Authority of Prosecutor:** The Court also rejected the argument that only the Quezon City Prosecutor had authority. The DOJ State Prosecutor had national scope and authority under Executive Order No. 292, especially considering that the CTA had jurisdiction over the case.
*   **Equal Protection:** The Court found no merit in the equal protection argument based on the dismissal of similar charges against another individual. Santos failed to demonstrate a "clear and intentional discrimination." Citing *People v. Dela Piedra*, 403 Phil. 31 (2001).
*   **Due Process:** The court found that there was no violation of due process because the petitioner had the opportunity to file affidavits and other pleadings and submit evidence before the DOJ during the preliminary investigation of her case and before the Information was filed against her.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Certiorari Jurisdiction of CTA en banc:** The court explicitly does not rule on whether the CTA *en banc* has jurisdiction over special civil actions for certiorari, because it was not properly raised as an issue. This leaves open a question about the proper forum for challenging interlocutory orders of the CTA First Division.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion Standard:** The high standard for proving grave abuse of discretion (capricious, whimsical, arbitrary) makes it difficult to successfully challenge interlocutory orders via certiorari.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 1125 (Creating the Court of Tax Appeals)
*   Republic Act No. 9282 (Expanding the Jurisdiction of the CTA)
*   National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), Sections 255, 254, 248(B), 220
*   Revised Rules of Court, Rule 41, Rule 65
*   Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987)
*   *People v. Dela Piedra*, 403 Phil. 31 (2001)

**Overall Assessment:**

The decision reinforces the general rule against appealing interlocutory orders, even in the context of the expanded CTA jurisdiction.  It emphasizes the need for the accused to proceed to trial and appeal any adverse final judgment. A petition for certiorari could succeed only with evidence of grave abuse of discretion, which was not present here. The case leaves open the question of the CTA's jurisdiction over certiorari petitions, which may require future clarification.
