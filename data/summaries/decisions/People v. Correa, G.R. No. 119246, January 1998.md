**Case Summary: People v. Correa, G.R. No. 119246 (1998)**

**Facts:** Accused-appellants Correa, Gunida, and Dulay were convicted by the RTC of Manila for violating Section 4, Article II of R.A. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act), as amended by R.A. 7659, for delivering and transporting 16.1789 kilograms of marijuana. The RTC sentenced them to death and a fine of P10,000,000. The conviction stemmed from the testimony of SPO3 Faller, who stated that based on intelligence reports, the accused were transporting drugs in a vehicle which was later stopped, searched, and found to contain marijuana. The accused raised alibi as a defense, claiming illegal arrest in Caloocan City.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation:** Sec. 4, Art. II of R.A. 6425 (transportation and delivery of prohibited drugs).
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution's case hinged primarily on the testimony of SPO3 Faller and the seized marijuana.
*   **Search & Seizure:** Appellants challenged the legality of the search and seizure, arguing it was conducted without a warrant.
*   **Penalty:** The RTC imposed the death penalty based on the quantity of drugs and the use of a motor vehicle as an aggravating circumstance.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The appellants are primarily liable for the delivery and transport of illegal drugs.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The success of the appeal hinges on whether the search was legal, whether the chain of custody was valid, and whether the evidence was admissible.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The prosecution's case rests heavily on the credibility of SPO3 Faller. The defense challenged his testimony as fabricated.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The RTC incorrectly applied the use of a motor vehicle as an aggravating circumstance, given that transportation is an element of the offense itself.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act), Sec. 4, Art. II:** Defines the crime of illegal drug transportation and its penalties.
*   **R.A. 7659:** Amended R.A. 6425, increasing penalties for certain drug offenses.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 62:** Addresses the effects of mitigating and aggravating circumstances.
*   **People vs. Espejo (36 SCRA 400):** (Cited by the trial court) - Ruled inapplicable by the Supreme Court.
*   **Doctrine:** Voluntarily submitting to a search waives the right to contest it later.
*   **Doctrine:** An appeal in a criminal case throws the entire case open for review.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The RTC's application of the aggravating circumstance (use of a motor vehicle) is contentious, as the Supreme Court ultimately found it inherent in the crime of transportation itself.
*   The RTC did not present the testimonies of the 8 other members of the Police enforcement team.

**Conclusion (Supreme Court Decision):** The Supreme Court upheld the conviction but modified the penalty. The Court ruled that the use of a motor vehicle could not be considered an aggravating circumstance in this case as transportation is an element of the offense, and it is inherent. The death penalty was reduced to *reclusion perpetua*, but the fine of P10,000,000 was affirmed. The Court found the alibi of the accused to be weak and the testimony of SPO3 Faller to be credible.
