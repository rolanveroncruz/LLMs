## Legal Document Summary - *Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board vs. Central Mindanao Construction Multi-Purpose Cooperative*

**Case:** G.R. No. 242296, July 31, 2024. *Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB) vs. Central Mindanao Construction Multi-Purpose Cooperative (CMCM Cooperative)*

**Issue:** Validity of PCAB Board Resolution No. 915, series of 2011, requiring cooperatives to incorporate as a condition for continued grant/renewal of contractor's licenses, specifically regarding the need for Presidential approval as per RA 4566.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision (and effectively the RTC decision), ruling that Board Resolution No. 915 is **null and void** for lack of Presidential approval as required by Section 5 of RA 4566 and lack of confirmation by the CIAP.  The Court also held that it was an *ultra vires* act and infringed on the constitutional protections afforded to cooperatives.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PCAB Resolution No. 915 (2011):** Mandated cooperatives to incorporate as a business corporation as a *sine qua non* for continued contractor's license. Essentially requiring cooperatives to convert into corporations for renewal of licenses by CY 2013-2014.

*   **RA 4566 (Contractor's License Law), Section 5:** Requires Presidential approval for PCAB to issue rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of the Act.  Notably, the SC interprets this to apply to *all* rules and regulations, not solely the IRR.

*   **RA 9520 (Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008), Art. 23:** Defines types of cooperatives, including "service cooperatives" which can engage in "other services," encompassing construction.

*   **1987 Constitution, Article XII, Section 1:** Guarantees the protection of cooperatives.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **PCAB:** Liable for issuing a resolution that is *ultra vires*, violates RA 4566, lacks required approvals, and potentially infringes on the rights of cooperatives under RA 9520 and the Constitution. Faces the risk of further legal challenges to similar resolutions or policies.

*   **CMCM Cooperative:** Risks losing its construction business if it complies with the now-invalid Resolution No. 915.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 4566:** Contractor's License Law, specifically Section 5 requiring Presidential approval of rules and regulations.

*   **RA 9520:** Philippine Cooperative Code of 2008.

*   **Rule 41 and 45 of Rules of Court:** Regarding modes of appeal.

*   **Rule 50 of Rules of Court:** Regarding dismissal of improper appeal to the Court of Appeals

**Case Law:**

*   ***Republic v. Caraig***: Defines questions of law vs. questions of fact for determining appellate jurisdiction.
*   ***Waterfront Philippines, Inc. v. Social Security System***: Clarifies the classification of "ultra vires" acts
*   ***Sobrejuanite-Flores v. Pilando***:  Acknowledges administrative regulations enshrined in board resolutions
*   ***Republic v. Court of Appeals***:  Statutes in derogation of common or general rights are strictly construed
*   ***Heirs of Gamboa v. Teves***: Clarifies the effect of an ultra vires act

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of Section 5 of RA 4566:** PCAB argued that the Presidential approval requirement only applied to the initial IRR, but the Court rejected this, applying the principle that where the law does not distinguish, neither should the courts.

*   **Scope of "other services" under RA 9520:** PCAB contended that only specific types of cooperatives (e.g., agrarian reform) could engage in construction, but the Court interpreted the "other services" clause broadly to include construction by service cooperatives.

**Potential Risks & Concerns:**

*   **Implications for other regulations issued by PCAB:** This ruling establishes a clear precedent regarding the necessity of Presidential approval for all PCAB rules and regulations affecting the construction industry.
*   **Impact on the construction sector:** By preventing PCAB from enforcing Resolution No. 915, the Court ensures that cooperatives can continue to participate in the construction industry, potentially increasing competition and diversity.
*   **Lack of Confirmation by CIAP:** Also runs contrary to the Rules and Regulations Governing Licensing and Accreditation of Constructors in the Philippines.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court decisively sided with the CMCM Cooperative, reinforcing the requirement for Presidential approval and CIAP confirmation for PCAB regulations and upholding the constitutional protection of cooperatives. The ruling has broader implications for the validity of other PCAB regulations and highlights the importance of adhering to procedural requirements and statutory mandates.
