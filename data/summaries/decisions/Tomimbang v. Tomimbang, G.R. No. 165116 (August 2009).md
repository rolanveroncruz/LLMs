**Legal Document Summary: *Tomimbang v. Tomimbang, G.R. No. 165116, August 4, 2009***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the RTC's ruling in favor of the Respondent (Atty. Tomimbang) in a loan collection case against Petitioner (Maria Soledad Tomimbang).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Loan Agreement:** A loan was constituted between the siblings for renovation of Petitioner's apartment units. The initial condition was repayment upon completion of all renovations (eight units).
*   **Novation:** The central issue revolves around whether the original agreement was novated when the parties agreed to start monthly payments even with one unit (Unit A) unfinished. The Supreme Court (SC) found partial novation based on subsequent agreement and partial performance (monthly payments by Petitioner).  Cited Art. 1291 of the Civil Code on modification of obligations. Iloilo Traders Finance, Inc. v. Heirs of Sps. Soriano and Ong v. Bog単albal were cited regarding the nature of novation.
*   **Due Date & Demandability:** The SC affirmed the lower courts' finding that the loan was due and demandable due to the partial novation. The Petitioner's obligation to pay was triggered by the new payment agreement, regardless of the completion of renovations.
*   **Interest:** The SC upheld the imposition of 12% per annum legal interest from the date of extrajudicial demand, as there was no written stipulation regarding interest. The Court referred to Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals and Sunga-Chan v. Court of Appeals for computation and guidelines for interest.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The SC reversed the award of attorney's fees, finding no explicit factual, legal, or equitable justification in the lower court's decision, as required by law (citing Bu単ing v. Santos and Zacharias De los Santos v. Consuelo B. Papa).

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner:** Obligated to repay the principal loan amount of P3,989,802.25 plus 12% legal interest from the date of extrajudicial demand.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner:** Liable for the principal debt and accruing interest.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Formal Documentation for Novation:** The novation hinges on testimonial evidence (brother's testimony) and circumstantial evidence (Petitioner's partial payments). The absence of a written agreement specifying the new payment terms presents a potential weakness.
*   **Determining the Date of Extrajudicial Demand:** The precise date of the extrajudicial demand should be meticulously verified to accurately calculate the interest accrual.
*   **Compound Interest**: The RTC decision mentions Article 2212 (interest on interest) as a basis for awarding compounding interest. The Supreme Court Decision does not explicitly discuss compounded interest. The lawyer should ensure that the judgment is not interpreted to include compounded interest.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1169, 1186, 1291, 2208, 2212
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:** Guidelines on legal interest.
*   **Iloilo Traders Finance, Inc. v. Heirs of Sps. Soriano:** Extinctive vs. Modificatory Novation
*   **Ong v. Bog単albal:** Effects of Partial or Total Novation.
*   **Bu単ing v. Santos:** Requirements for awarding attorney's fees.
*   **Royal Cargo Corp. v. DFS Sports Unlimited, Inc.:** reiterating the rules on imposition of interest.
*   **Sunga-Chan v. Court of Appeals:** Imposition of interest and applicable rates

**Ambiguities:**

*   The exact date of the "extrajudicial demand" is not explicitly mentioned. The lawyer must determine this date as it is the starting point for the interest calculation.
