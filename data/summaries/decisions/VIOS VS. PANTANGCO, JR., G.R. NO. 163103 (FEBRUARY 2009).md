## Legal Document Summary: Vios vs. Pantangco, G.R. No. 163103

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision which effectively nullified an RTC decision that had overturned an MTC ejectment order.

**Background:** Pantangco (Respondent) filed an ejectment case (Civil Case No. 37-8529) in the MTC against Vios and the Antonios (Petitioners) based on ownership. The MTC ruled in favor of Pantangco. Vios, through new counsel, claimed lack of proper notice of the MTC decision (due to alleged prior withdrawal of original counsel, Atty. Sollano), leading to a Motion to Quash the Writ of Execution. The RTC granted Vios' Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus, annulling both the MTC decision and the writ, citing lack of notice to petitioners and ordering restoration of possession and application of Art. 448 of the Civil Code. Pantangco then filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of the RTC Decision with the CA, arguing the RTC exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the MTC decision on certiorari (instead of appeal) and improperly applying Art. 448.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Ejectment:** Original cause of action was ejectment based on Pantangco's claim of ownership and the Petitioners' refusal to vacate.
*   **Notice of Judgment:** Pivotal issue revolves around whether Vios received proper notice of the MTC decision.
*   **Restoration of Possession:** The RTC ordered Pantangco to restore possession to Vios and the Antonios.
*   **Article 448, Civil Code:** The RTC invoked Art. 448, granting Pantangco the option to appropriate the Petitioners' improvements or require them to purchase the land, or pay rent.

**Liabilities:**

*   The MTC initially held Vios and the Antonios liable to vacate the property and pay compensation for its use.
*   The RTC decision reversed this liability, ordering Pantangco to restore possession and potentially pay for the improvements.
*   The Supreme Court found both Pantangco and the CA in error, thus the only valid parts of the RTC decision are those related to the lack of finality of the decision of the MTC and the invalidity of the writ of execution.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of Atty. Sollano's Withdrawal:** The alleged withdrawal of Atty. Sollano as Vios' counsel before the MTC decision is crucial. Lack of official documentation makes this a factual contention subject to evidentiary dispute. The MTC was justified in serving the decision to Atty. Sollano since the record was barren of any notice of withdraw from Atty. Sollano.
*   **Good Faith Possession:** The RTC's application of Article 448 hinges on the Petitioners' good faith in constructing improvements. This is a contentious point requiring factual determination.
*   **Non-Party Spouses Antonio:** Only Vios filed the certiorari petition with the RTC, yet the RTC ruled in favor of the Antonios as well.
*   **Lack of Proper Remedy in Court of Appeals:** The CA erred in taking cognizance of Pantangco's Rule 47 petition, because the availability of appeal foreclosed all other review remedies.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court (Certiorari):** Used by Vios to challenge the MTC decision in the RTC.
*   **Rule 41, Rules of Court:** Dictates the proper remedy to question the RTC decision is an ordinary appeal.
*   **Rule 47, Rules of Court:** Dictates when annulment of judgement can be used.
*   **Article 448, Civil Code:** Pertains to the rights of a builder in good faith on land owned by another.
*   **Rules of Court:** The rules of court dictate how the MTC's decision may be appealed.

**Case Law:**

*   **Magestrado v. People, G.R. No. 148072 (2007):** Establishes that the proper remedy from an RTC decision on certiorari is an ordinary appeal, not a further petition for certiorari.
*   **Ramirez-Jongco v. Veloso III, G.R. No. 149839 (2002):** Re-iterates that the remedy of annulment of judgment can only be used when the ordinary remedies are not available.
*   **Ba√±es v. Lutheran Church in the Philippines G.R. No. 142308 (2005):** Defines the law of the case doctrine.
*   **Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., Sales Force Union-PTGWO-BALAIS v. Coca-Cola Bottlers, Philippines, Inc., G.R. No. 155651 (2005):** Discusses the doctrine of finality of judgment.
*   **People v. Laguio, G.R. No. 128587 (2007):** States that errors in the courts exercise of jurisdiction do not void the judgement.

**Analysis:**

The Supreme Court held the CA erred in entertaining Pantangco's petition because an ordinary appeal was the proper remedy. While Pantangco took the wrong remedy, the RTC also exceeded its jurisdiction in reversing the MTC decision on the merits and applying Art. 448 within a certiorari proceeding. The SC, while recognizing the CA's error, refused to fully validate the RTC decision due to its jurisdictional flaws.

**Next Steps:**

The Supreme Court only recognizes the RTC decision as it relates to the lack of finality of the MTC decision, and the invalidity of the writ of execution. The parties are directed to act guided by the Supreme Court Decision.
