## Legal Document Summary: *People vs. Noay*, G.R. No. 122102 (1998)

This is a decision of the Supreme Court affirming with modifications the lower court's conviction of Loreto Noay for murder (Art. 248, RPC, before amendment by RA 7659), frustrated murder, and attempted murder, all qualified by treachery.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Accusation:** Loreto Noay was charged with:
    *   Murder of Paterno Patajo (Crim. Case No. 10223)
    *   Frustrated Murder of Regino Patajo (Crim. Case No. 10358)
    *   Attempted Murder of Pedrito Patajo (Crim. Case No. 10357)
*   **Self-Defense Claim:** Noay claimed self-defense, alleging prior unlawful aggression by the victims, necessitating the use of force to repel the attack.
*   **Treachery:** The prosecution alleged and the trial court found that the killing of Paterno was qualified by treachery (alevosia).
*   **Voluntary Surrender:** The trial court considered voluntary surrender as a mitigating circumstance in all three cases.
*   **Penalties:** The lower court sentenced Noay to reclusion perpetua for murder, imprisonment for frustrated murder and attempted murder, and ordered payment of damages.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Conviction Upheld:** Noay's conviction on all three charges was affirmed by the Supreme Court.
*   **Penalties Modified:** The Supreme Court modified the indeterminate sentences imposed, correctly applying the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender under Art. 64(2), RPC.
    *   **Murder:** Indeterminate sentence of 12 years and 1 day of *reclusion temporal* to 20 years of *reclusion temporal*.
    *   **Frustrated Murder:** Indeterminate sentence of 6 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 12 years of *prision mayor*.
    *   **Attempted Murder:** Indeterminate sentence of 6 months and 1 day of *prision correccional* to 6 years of *prision correccional*.
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   Indemnity of P50,000.00 to the heirs of Paterno
    *   Burial expenses of P4,900.00 to the heirs of Paterno
    *   Moral damages of P20,000.00 to Regino Patajo
    *   Moral damages award to Pedrito Patajo was deleted

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Self-Defense Rejection:** The Supreme Court found Noay's self-defense claim inconsistent and unbelievable due to contradictions between his testimony, his witness's testimony, and his earlier statements. *People vs. Vallador* (1996), *People vs. Isleta* (1996)
*   **Treachery Finding:** The Court upheld the finding of treachery, relying on eyewitness testimony of a sudden, unexpected attack where the victim was blinded by a flashlight. *People vs. Castillo* (1996), *People vs. Cogonon* (1996)
*   **Moral Damages:** The grant of moral damages to Pedrito was erroneous as he did not testify that he suffered extreme physical pain as a consequence of the stabbing.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Specifically, Articles 248 (Murder), 50 & 61(3) (Frustrated Murder), 51 & 61 (3) & (4) (Attempted Murder), 64 (Rules for application of penalties), 70 (Successive Service of Sentences), 76 (Penalty Divisible), and 77 (Penalty Indivisible).
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:** Amendment to the RPC.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Governs the imposition of penalties. *People vs. Ignacio* (1965)
*   **Case Law on Self-Defense:** *People vs. Vallador* (1996), *People vs. Isleta* (1996), *People vs. Deopante* (1996)

*   **Case Law on Moral Damages:** *People vs. Alas* (1997)

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The self-defense claim was highly contentious, with the court ultimately rejecting it due to inconsistencies and contradictions in the accused's and his witness's testimonies.
