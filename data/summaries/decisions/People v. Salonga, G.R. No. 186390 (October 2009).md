## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Salonga*, G.R. No. 186390 (2009)

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Rosemarie Salonga for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), specifically for selling 0.06 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu). The RTC acquitted her on the charge of possession. The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision, acquitting Salonga due to reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5 (Illegal Sale):**  The core charge revolves around the unlawful sale, dispensation, delivery, transportation, or distribution of dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21 (Chain of Custody):** The crucial point of contention is the procedural requirements for the handling of seized drugs, including immediate marking, inventory, and photography at the buy-bust site in the presence of the accused and certain witnesses.
* **Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165:** Specifies the need to inventory and photograph the drugs seized in the presence of the accused and representatives from the media, DOJ, and an elected public official.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, the RTC imposed a penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 based on the drug pushing conviction. This was overturned.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody Issues:**  The most significant risk and contentious point is the flawed chain of custody. The police failed to mark the seized evidence at the scene, as required by Section 21 of RA 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations. The explanation for these lapses was inconsistent and deemed insufficient.
*   **Witness Credibility:**  The prosecution's case rested primarily on the testimony of a single police officer (PO1 Reyes), whose credibility was undermined by inconsistencies in her statements regarding coordination with PDEA and the photographer.
*   **Lack of Corroboration:** PO1 Reyes' testimony was not properly corroborated, especially concerning the chain of custody. The death of other officers involved in the buy-bust exacerbated this problem. The defense of frame-up was rejected by lower courts.
*   **Non-compliance Justification:** The prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for non-compliance with the chain of custody rules, which weakens their case significantly.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** The primary statute under which the accused was charged.
*   **People v. Partoza, G.R. No. 182418, May 8, 2009:** Cited for the importance of adhering to Section 21 of RA 9165.
*   **People v. Robles, G.R. No. 177220, April 24, 2009:** Cited to show that failure to comply with drug seizure procedures raises doubts about the evidence's origins.
*   **Sales v. People, G.R. No. 182296, April 7, 2009:** Cited regarding the need to establish drug identity with unwavering exactitude.
*  **People v. Cantalejo, G.R. No. 182790, April 24, 2009.** Used as a reference to show how the testimony of a police officer is afforded full faith and credit unless the officer's duty is tainted with irregularities, destroying the presumption afforded to law enforcement officers.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The court notes the initial presumption that police officers perform their duties regularly, but emphasizes that this presumption can be overturned by evidence of irregularities.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "justifiable grounds" exception in Section 21 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 became a point of contention, as the court found the prosecution's reasons for non-compliance to be inadequate. The multiple justifications in the case are an indication of potential ambiguity.
