## Legal Document Summary - *Mercidar Fishing Corporation v. NLRC and Agao, Jr.* (G.R. No. 112574, October 8, 1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing NLRC decision upholding Labor Arbiter's finding of illegal dismissal and awarding backwages, 13th-month pay, and service incentive leave pay.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Art. 82 of the Labor Code:** Defines "field personnel" exempt from certain working conditions and rest period benefits, specifically service incentive leave pay.
*   **Constructive Dismissal:** Private respondent Agao claims constructive dismissal due to refusal of assignments after a medical leave. Petitioner alleges abandonment.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer (Mercidar):** Obligation to reinstate Agao, pay backwages, 13th-month pay, and service incentive leave pay as ordered by Labor Arbiter and upheld by NLRC.
*   **Employee (Agao):** None currently. The case centers around previous employment obligations.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Mercidar Fishing Corporation:** Liable for backwages, 13th-month pay, and service incentive leave pay to Fermin Agao, Jr. due to a finding of constructive dismissal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Incorrect Classification of Employees:** The central risk for Mercidar is the misclassification of its fishermen as not being "field personnel". If the Supreme Court had reversed the decision, Mercidar would not have been liable for service incentive leave pay. Future similar claims.
*   **Factual Findings Binding:** Reliance by the Court on the NLRC's and Labor Arbiter's factual findings, making it difficult to overturn their decisions regarding constructive dismissal.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 82:** Definition of "field personnel" and exemption from certain benefits.
*   **P.D. No. 851:** Violation alleged in the original complaint regarding the 13th Month pay.
*   **Union of Filipro Employees (UFE) v. Vicar, 205 SCRA 200 (1992):**  Clarifies the meaning of "whose actual hours of work in the field cannot be determined with reasonable certainty" in Art. 82, linking it to the level of supervision by the employer.
*   **Rule IV, Book III of the Implementing Rules**: Amplification of the field of personnel definition.
*   **Gelmart Industries (Phils.), Inc. vs. Leogardo, 155 SCRA 403, 409, L-70544, November 5, 1987**: Labor Arbiter's discretion to determine which party deserves credence on the basis of evidence received.
*   **Dagupan Bus Co., Inc. vs. NLRC, 191 SCRA 328**: Requisites for abandonment of position: concurrence of the intention to abandon and some overt acts from which it may be inferred that the employee concerned has no more interest in working.
*   **Hua Bee Shirt Factory vs. NLRC, 188 SCRA 586**: Filing of the complaint which asked for reinstatement plus backwages is inconsistent with respondentsâ€™ defense of abandonment.
*   **International Container Terminal Services, Inc. v. NLRC, 256 SCRA 124 (1996)**; **Belaunzaran v. NLRC, 265 SCRA 800 (1996)**: Factual findings of quasi-judicial bodies are generally binding as long as they are supported substantially by evidence.
*   **Hernandez v. NLRC, 176 SCRA 269 (1989)**: Reinstatement may not be ordered if, as a result of the case between the parties, their relation is strained.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Field Personnel" (Art. 82):** The core dispute centers on whether fishermen qualify as "field personnel" under Art. 82. The Court relies on the level of supervision, finding that fishermen on a vessel are effectively supervised, thus not qualifying as field personnel. The application of "reasonable certainty" for determining hours of work in the field.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court *dismissed* the petition, upholding the NLRC decision and Labor Arbiter's findings.
