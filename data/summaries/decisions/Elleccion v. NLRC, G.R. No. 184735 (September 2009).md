**Legal Document Summary: _Miriam B. Elleccion Vda. de Lecciones vs. National Labor Relations Commission, NNA Philippines Co., Inc. and Ms. Kimi Kimura_ (G.R. No. 184735, September 17, 2009)**

**Nature:** Resolution denying a motion for reconsideration of a petition for review on certiorari regarding an illegal dismissal case.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Redundancy as Justification for Dismissal:** NNA Philippines Co., Inc. (NNA Philippines) terminated Miriam B. Elleccion Vda. de Lecciones' employment as Administrator due to redundancy, citing a directive from NNA Japan Co., Ltd. to streamline operations and abolish redundant positions.
*   **Managerial Employee Status:** Elleccion claimed illegal dismissal and sought overtime pay, among other monetary claims. The Court affirmed the CA's denial of overtime pay, holding she was a managerial employee, not entitled to such under Article 82 of the Labor Code and Book III, Rule I, Section 2(c) of its Implementing Rules.
*   **Due Process and Criteria for Redundancy:** Elleccion argued the dismissal was invalid due to lack of supporting evidence and failure to appraise her of fair criteria for redundancy. The court rejected this, stating substantial evidence supported the redundancy and found no violation of due process, as NNA followed statutory requirements for notice to the employee and DOLE.
*   **Separation Pay:** Elleccion received separation pay, other benefits, and salary, but refused to accept the separation pay.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer (NNA Philippines):** Obligated to provide Elleccion with separation pay equivalent to one month's salary for every year of service, along with other benefits and final pay. The employer complied with statutory requirements for redundancy termination.
*   **Employee (Elleccion):** Duty to provide evidence for claims of malice or bad faith in the redundancy declaration.

**Liabilities:**

*   The employer is not liable for illegal dismissal, overtime pay, moral damages, or attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Redundancy:** The core issue was whether the employer adequately substantiated the redundancy claim. The Court deferred to management's business judgment, finding no evidence of arbitrariness or malice. The petitioner's argument for additional compensation as Corporate Secretary was dismissed on the ground that it was an intra-corporate matter.
*   **Managerial Status Determination:** Elleccion's classification as a managerial employee significantly impacted her eligibility for overtime pay. The specific duties and responsibilities were not explicitly detailed, potentially raising questions about the accuracy of this classification.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   _Lopez Sugar Corporation v. Franco, G.R. No. 148195, May 16, 2005, 458 SCRA 515:_ Cited regarding the characterization of an employee's services as no longer necessary or sustainable as an exercise of business judgment.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 82:** Exclusion of managerial employees from coverage of overtime pay provisions.
*   **Implementing Rules, Book III, Rule I, Section 2(c):** Definition and criteria for managerial employees.
