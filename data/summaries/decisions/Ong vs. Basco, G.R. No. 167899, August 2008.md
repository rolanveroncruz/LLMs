**Case Summary: *Willie Ong v. Lucia N. Basco*, G.R. No. 167899, August 6, 2008 (583 Phil. 248)**

**Core Issue:** Propriety of a Rule 65 certiorari petition to challenge the denial of a motion for inhibition after final judgment and perfection of appeal.

**Facts:** Willie Ong (Excel Fitness Center) was ordered by the RTC to pay Lucia Basco damages. Ong filed a Motion for Reconsideration and a Motion for Inhibition against Judge Reyes, which were both denied. Ong then filed a Notice of Appeal and *simultaneously* a Rule 65 certiorari petition with the CA challenging the denial of the inhibition motion. The CA dismissed the certiorari petition.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's dismissal, holding that certiorari was an improper remedy because Ong had an adequate remedy through appeal.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Certiorari Improper (Rule 65):** Certiorari is not a substitute for appeal, especially when an appeal has already been perfected. Remedy by appeal was adequate and expeditious.
*   **Section 2, Rule 137 (Disqualification of Judges):**  "No appeal or stay shall be allowed from, or by means of, his decision in favor of his own competency, until after final judgment in the case." The issue of judicial bias can be raised on appeal from the main decision.
*   **Timing of Inhibition Motion:** Resort to certiorari challenging a denial of inhibition is generally inappropriate *after* judgment on the merits, unless exceptional circumstances exist. No exceptional circumstances here.
*   **Bias and Partiality Standard:** Mere suspicion of partiality is insufficient. Bias must stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits based on something other than what the judge learned from the case.  Adverse rulings do not automatically indicate bias. Requires clear and convincing evidence.
*   **Voluntary vs. Mandatory Disqualification (Rule 137, Sec 1):** The case did not involve mandatory disqualification grounds, so the issue of voluntary inhibition was a matter of the judge's discretion and conscience.
*   **Forum Shopping:** The simultaneity of the appeal and the certiorari petition raises a concern for forum shopping.
*   **Bristol Myers Squibb v. Viloria Test:**  Certiorari may be granted where appeal is available when (a) grave abuse of discretion (b) appeal is not a speedy and adequate remedy (c) order is a patent nullity (d) decision will arrest future litigations (e) public welfare and public policy. None of these exceptions applied here.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Ong remains obligated to comply with the RTC judgment and its affirmance on appeal.
*   Ong liable for costs.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Further delays and costs associated with pursuing improper legal remedies.
*   Potential for sanctions related to forum shopping, if argued by the respondent.

*   *Bristol Myers Squibb v. Viloria*, G.R. No. 148156 (2004)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** The ruling emphasizes the discretion of the judge in cases of voluntary inhibition. The level of evidence required to demonstrate bias in the absence of mandatory disqualification is high.

**Legal Strategy Implications:**  This case reinforces the principle that certiorari is not a substitute for appeal and highlights the difficulty of successfully challenging a judge's competency after a judgment on the merits, absent clear evidence of bias stemming from extrajudicial sources or a clear violation of mandatory disqualification rules. Litigants should focus on preserving issues for appeal and ensuring that motions for inhibition are made and resolved *before* a final judgment.
