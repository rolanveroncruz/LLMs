**Case Summary: Privatization and Management Office vs. Legaspi Towers 300, Inc. (G.R. No. 147957, July 22, 2009)**

**Legal Issue:** Whether a voluntary easement exists over a property acquired by the National Government (through APT, now PMO) due to the presence of a generator set and sump pumps servicing a condominium (Legaspi Towers 300), and if so, what are the implications?

**Background:**

*   Caruff Development Corporation (Caruff) owned adjacent lots; one set where the Legaspi Towers 300 condominium was built, and another (TCT No. 127649/200760) where the generating set and sump pumps servicing the condominium were located.
*   Caruff mortgaged the condominium lots to PNB.
*   Caruff defaulted, PNB foreclosed, and PNB acquired the condominium lots and the equipment on the other lot in the foreclosure.
*   Proclamation No. 50 led to the creation of APT.
*   PNB transferred its rights/interests in the Caruff receivables, including the foreclosed properties to the National Government via APT.
*   Caruff sued PNB to nullify the foreclosure (Civil Case No. 85-29512).
*   A Compromise Agreement was reached, and Caruff agreed to transfer TCT No. 127649/200760 to the National Government (thru APT), "free from any and all liens and encumbrances."  The RTC approved the agreement.
*   Legaspi Towers 300 filed suit (Spec. Proc. No. 89-49563) seeking a declaration of an easement over the portion of TCT No. 127649/200760 occupied by the generator set and sump pumps.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the lower courts and held that NO easement existed.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Easement (Civil Code Articles 613, 619):** An easement is an encumbrance imposed on an immovable for the benefit of another immovable belonging to a different owner. The court noted that when Caruff owned both properties, no true easement could exist as both belonged to the same owner.
*   **Apparent Sign of Easement (Civil Code Article 624):**  This article deals with a situation where a property is divided, and an apparent sign of easement exists.  The SC found that the crucial element for an easement to be maintained after the division of ownership was negated by the Compromise Agreement.
*   **Compromise Agreement (Civil Code Articles 2028, 2037):** The Compromise Agreement stipulated that Caruff would transfer the subject property "free from any and all liens and encumbrances." This was approved by the RTC, and the SC found that the explicit terms of the agreement override any implied intent to create a voluntary easement. *Alonzo v. San Juan, G.R. No. 137549, February 11, 2005*, reiterates the binding nature of compromise agreements.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Legaspi Towers 300 must remove the generator set and sump pumps from TCT No. 200760.
*   Legaspi Towers 300 must pay reasonable rent at P56.25 per square meter per month, retroactive from August 28, 1989, until the removal is complete.
*   The SC reasoned that Legaspi Towers had unjustly enriched themselves by using the property of the National Government without compensation, invoking Article 22 of the Civil Code, which prevents unjust enrichment. *"Car Cool Philippines, Inc. v. Ushio Realty and Development Corporation, G.R. No. 138088, January 23, 2006"* established the elements of unjust enrichment.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation of Rent:** While the SC established the rental rate (based on APT's internal valuation), further litigation is possible if the actual square meter area occupied by the generator set and sump pumps is contested.
*   **Enforcement Challenges:**  Enforcing the removal of the equipment may present logistical and practical difficulties, potentially leading to further legal challenges if Legaspi Towers 300 is resistant.
*   **Impact on Condominium Residents:** The ruling and its enforcement could significantly impact the condominium residents who depend on the equipment, potentially creating political or public relations issues for PMO.
