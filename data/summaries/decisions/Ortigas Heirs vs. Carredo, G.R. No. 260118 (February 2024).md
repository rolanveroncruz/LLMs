**Case:** *Paolo Martin M. Ortigas, et al. v. Court of Appeals and Hesilito N. Carredo* (G.R. No. 260118, February 12, 2024)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing the CA's dismissal of a Petition for Annulment of Judgment.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Lumauig mortgaged property to Jocelyn M. Ortigas in 1999 (REM annotated on TCT).
*   Lumauigs defaulted; Jocelyn passed away, and her heirs (Ortigas Heirs) inherited her rights.
*   Carredo purchased the property at a tax delinquency auction sale and obtained a new TCT.
*   Carredo filed a petition (Civil Case No. R-QZN-18-10658-CV) in RTC Quezon City for cancellation of the REM, naming Jocelyn Ortigas as respondent.
*   RTC granted the petition after substituted service via publication on Jocelyn, who was already deceased at the time of filing.
*   Ortigas Heirs sought to annul the RTC judgment, alleging lack of jurisdiction and violation of due process.
*   CA dismissed the petition for annulment, citing procedural defects and failure to establish lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Annulment of Judgment (Rule 47):**  Grounds are limited to extrinsic fraud or lack of jurisdiction.  Remedy of last resort, unavailable if other remedies were available and not used through fault.
*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** The central issue is whether the RTC acquired jurisdiction over Jocelyn Ortigas, who was deceased when the cancellation case was filed. Cites *Gaffney v. Butler* and *Spouses Berot v. Siapno* for the principle that a deceased person lacks the capacity to be sued. *Ventura v. Militante* is cited regarding the necessity of proper party defendants for a court to acquire jurisdiction. The court emphasizes that the defect goes to the substance of the matter, not merely procedure.
*   **Due Process Violation:** Ortigas Heirs argue that the judgment was issued without their participation as Jocelyn's heirs, violating their right to due process. Service on a deceased party is inherently defective.  Cites *De Pedro v. Romasan Development Corporation* emphasizing that defects in jurisdiciton, include violation of due process.
*   **Laches/Estoppel:** Carredo argues that the Ortigas Heirs are barred by laches. The SC finds no laches, noting the relatively short time between the RTC decision and the filing of the annulment petition, as well as the active diligence in pursuing available remedies. Cites *Amoguis v. Ballado* defining Laches.
*   **Procedural Requirements for Annulment:** The CA dismissed the petition for failing to include annexes and a proper verification. The SC finds these requirements less stringent when challenging jurisdiction rather than fraud, and irrelevant in this case, because the Ortigas Heirs were not party to the original Civil Case and no facts are in dispute.

**Ruling/Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court *GRANTED* the petition and *NULLIFIED* the CA resolutions and RTC judgment.
*   The RTC *lacked jurisdiction* over the deceased Jocelyn Ortigas and failed to implead her heirs properly, violating due process. The annulment was proper based on lack of jurisdiction.
*   The Register of Deeds is ordered to re-annotate the real estate mortgage on the TCT.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   **Carredo's Claim to the Property:**  Carredo's claim based on the tax delinquency sale is now subject to the reinstated real estate mortgage. Foreclosure proceedings by the Ortigas Heirs are now possible.
*   **Defective Tax Sale:** Potential challenge to the validity of the tax sale itself due to the defective service of notice on a deceased person.
*   **Interest and Penalties:** The Ortigas Heirs may seek to enforce the original mortgage agreement, including accrued interest and penalties, which the court notes were agreed to be 5% compounded monthly interest plus 1% penalty per month in case of default.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The high interest rate (5% compounded monthly + 1% penalty) in the original mortgage agreement may be subject to challenge as unconscionable under Article 1255 of the Civil Code. This would be a matter for a new litigation.
*   The validity of the initial tax sale, while not directly addressed, is implicitly questioned due to the defective service to a deceased individual. This could trigger a separate action to nullify the tax sale *ab initio*.

**Action Items:**

1.  File for reinstatement of Mortgage.
2.  Send demand letter to Carredo, then initiate extrajudicial foreclosure.
3.  Evaluate and investigate validity of tax sale.
4.  Prepare for potential action/counteraction arguing usurious interest rates.
