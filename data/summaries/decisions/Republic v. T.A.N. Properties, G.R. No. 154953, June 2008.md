## Legal Document Summary: Republic v. T.A.N. Properties, Inc. (G.R. No. 154953)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review)

**Core Issue:** Propriety of granting original registration of title to a corporation (T.A.N. Properties, Inc.) for a large tract of land (56.4007 hectares) based on claimed possession by its predecessors-in-interest.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and Regional Trial Court decisions, denying T.A.N. Properties' application for land registration.

**Key Provisions/Holdings:**

*   **Burden of Proof of Alienability & Disposability:** The applicant (T.A.N. Properties) failed to overcome the presumption that the land is part of the public domain. The presented certifications from CENRO and FMS-DENR were deemed insufficient and inadmissible. The Court emphasized that the applicant must prove the DENR Secretary approved land classification and released the land, and that the land subject to the application falls within that approved area per verification survey by PENRO/CENRO.
*   **Lack of Evidence of Open, Continuous, Exclusive, and Notorious Possession:** The Court found insufficient evidence to prove that T.A.N. Properties' predecessors-in-interest possessed the land openly, continuously, exclusively, and notoriously in the concept of an owner since June 12, 1945, as required by law. The testimony of the witness was deemed uncorroborated and insufficient, and the tax declarations lacked crucial early history.
*   **Disqualification of Corporation from Acquiring Public Land:** Citing Section 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution, the Court held that private corporations are absolutely prohibited from acquiring any kind of alienable land of the public domain, except by lease. This constitutional prohibition renders T.A.N. Properties, Inc. ineligible to acquire land in the public domain.
*   **Director of Lands v. IAC (Acme Plywood) Doctrine Distinguished:** The court distinguished this case from *Director of Lands v. IAC*, clarifying that *Director of Lands* applies only when the corporation acquires the land *after* the land has already been converted to private property through the requisite statutory period of adverse possession by the transferor. Here, the land was *not* private land when T.A.N. Properties acquired it.

**Statutory References:**

*   Section 3, Article XII, 1987 Constitution (Restriction on corporate land ownership)
*   Commonwealth Act No. 141 (The Public Land Act, as amended by RA 9176)
*   Rule 132, Sections 19, 23, and 24 of the Revised Rules on Evidence (Admissibility and probative value of public documents)

**Case Law:**

*   *Republic v. Naguiat* (Burden of proof in land registration cases)
*   *Chavez v. Public Estates Authority* (Constitutional prohibition against corporate land ownership)
*   *Director of Lands v. IAC (Acme Plywood)* (Conditions for corporate land acquisition when transferor had already a vested right)
*   *Natividad v. Court of Appeals* (Corporate application must show land was already private when acquired).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Certifications:** The case highlights the importance of proper authentication and probative value of government certifications related to land classification. The mere presentation of a certificate is insufficient; testimony from issuing officials may be required.
*   **Proof of Possession:** Establishing "open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession" remains a fact-intensive inquiry.  The testimony of single witness will be closely scrutinized and evidence of tax payment history is an important supporting documents to prove the period of possession.
*   **Corporate Land Ownership:** This case reinforces the strict constitutional ban on corporate ownership of alienable public land (except by lease) and severely limits the applicability of *Director of Lands* in such cases.
*   **Retroactive Application of Constitutional Prohibitions:** The Court's analysis emphasizes that a corporation cannot acquire land through tacking the possession of its predecessors-in-interest when the acquisition occurs after the effective date of constitutional provisions prohibiting such acquisitions.

**Conclusion:**

This case underscores the difficulties faced by corporations seeking to register land based on the claimed possession of their predecessors-in-interest, given constitutional restrictions on corporate land ownership. It emphasizes the applicant's burden to prove both alienability/disposability and the required period of possession, and it clarifies the limited application of the *Director of Lands* doctrine.
