## Legal Document Summary: Kua vs. Barbers, G.R. No. 159410

**Case:** *Nixon T. Kua vs. Robert Dean S. Barbers*, G.R. No. 159410, January 28, 2008 (566 Phil. 516)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a Quo Warranto petition.

**Key Issue:** Validity of Robert Dean S. Barbers' appointment as General Manager/Chief Executive Officer of the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA), specifically whether Nixon T. Kua's prior appointment had already expired, making the position vacant. The core dispute revolves around the interpretation of P.D. No. 564 (Revised Charter of the PTA) as amended by P.D. No. 1400, particularly Sections 15, 16, and 23-A.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court DENIED Kua's petition and AFFIRMED the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding Barbers' appointment.

**Key Provisions & Interpretation:**

*   **P.D. No. 564, Sec. 23-A (added by P.D. No. 1400):**  Establishes a six-year term for the PTA General Manager.  The primary point of contention is whether this term is fixed and independent or subject to the rotational scheme applicable to other members of the PTA Board.
*   **P.D. No. 564, Secs. 15 & 16:**  Define the term of office and filling of vacancies for part-time members of the Board. Sec. 16 is key, stating appointees filling vacancies serve "only for the unexpired portion of the term."
*   **Court's Interpretation:** The Court held that Sections 15 & 16 apply to *all* members of the Board, including the General Manager. It reasoned that amendments become an integral part of the original statute. Based on this reasoning, if a vacancy occurs, the appointee only serves the remaining portion of the unexpired term. The Court reasoned that sections 17 to 21 of P.D. No. 564, are applicable to all Board members, including the General Manager, thus Sections 15 and 16 apply to the General Manager.
*   **Application to Kua:** The Court found that Kua was appointed to fill the unexpired term of his predecessor, Banayo, which ended on April 5, 2002. Therefore, Barbers' appointment in November 2002 was valid because the position was already vacant.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 564:** Revised Charter of the Philippine Tourism Authority.
*   **P.D. No. 1400:** Amendment to P.D. No. 564, specifically adding Sec. 23-A regarding the General Manager's term.
*   **Republic v. Imperial (96 Phil. 770 (1955)) & Gaminde v. Commission on Audit (401 Phil. 77 (2000)):**  Cited by the Court of Appeals regarding the rotational scheme of appointments. The Supreme Court did not dwell on them after finding that the sections 15 and 16 are applicable to the General Manager.
*   **Estrada v. Caseda (84 Phil. 791 (1949)):** Used to illustrate the principle that an amended act is construed as if the original statute had been repealed.
*   **Binamira v. Garrucho (G.R. No. 92008, July 30, 1990, 188 SCRA 154):**  Cited by petitioner to show that Supreme Court never mentioned the rotation scheme for the PTA board member in this case.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Sec. 23-A:** The lack of explicit language in Sec. 23-A (regarding the term of the General Manager) about whether it is a fixed term or subject to the rotational scheme created the initial legal ambiguity.
*   **Application of Sections 15 & 16:** Applying Sections 15 and 16, originally intended for part-time Board members, to the General Manager could be viewed as a potential overreach in statutory interpretation.
*   **Implications for Security of Tenure:** This decision could have broader implications for the security of tenure of appointees to government positions, particularly where specific terms are established but not expressly tied to the beginning or end of a fixed period.

**Obligations:**

*   Barbers has the right to hold the position of PTA General Manager/CEO.
*   Kua is excluded from the position.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Court of Appeals decision dismissed with no pronouncements on the payment of costs.
*   The Supreme Court decision also has no pronouncements on the payment of costs.
