## Legal Document Summary - *Carlos T. Go, Sr. vs. Luis T. Ramos et al.*

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari challenging deportation orders against Jimmy T. Go a.k.a. Jaime T. Gaisano and related lower court rulings.

**Key Issue:** Jimmy T. Go's citizenship and the validity of deportation proceedings against him.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Carlos T. Go, Sr. (father of Jimmy), Jimmy T. Go, and the Commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration (BI).
*   **Respondent:** Luis T. Ramos (initiator of the deportation complaint).

**Factual Background:**

Luis T. Ramos filed a deportation complaint against Jimmy T. Go, alleging he is an illegal alien ("FChinese" on his birth certificate) who fraudulently obtained a Philippine passport. Jimmy claims he is a natural-born Filipino through his father, Carlos T. Go, Sr., who allegedly elected Philippine citizenship. The BI initially dismissed the complaint but reversed its decision, leading to deportation charges and proceedings.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Commonwealth Act No. 613 (Philippine Immigration Act of 1940), as amended:** Basis for deportation proceedings. Section 37(a)(9) in relation to Section 45(c) invoked, alleging Jimmy fraudulently represented himself as a Filipino citizen.
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 625:** Governs the election of Philippine citizenship by those with Filipino mothers. Issue: Carlos T. Go's compliance and timeliness.
*   **1935 Constitution, Article IV, Section 1:** Defines Philippine citizenship. Disputed application to Carlos T. Go and his children.
*   **Jus Sanguinis vs. Jus Soli:** The court reaffirms the application of *jus sanguinis* (citizenship by blood) over *jus soli* (citizenship by place of birth) in determining Philippine citizenship, following *Tan Chong v. Secretary of Labor*.

**Liabilities:**

*   Jimmy T. Go: Potential deportation as an illegal alien.
*   BI Commissioner: Duty to enforce immigration laws and deportation orders.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Deportation of Jimmy T. Go:** Loss of liberty and business interests.
*   **Challenge to Carlos T. Go's citizenship:** Although this decision should have no preclusive effect upon his citizenship.
*   **Legal Challenges:** Further appeals based on unresolved questions of fact, especially regarding evidence of Carlos T. Go Sr.'s claim to Philippine citizenship.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timeliness of Carlos T. Go's election of Philippine citizenship:** The court acknowledges the *Cuenco* decision extending the period under certain circumstances but finds none present here. This area remains open to interpretation.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence of Citizenship:** Whether evidence presented by Carlos and Jimmy is substantial enough to warrant a full trial under the strict rules of evidence in a regular court proceeding is subjective and open to further debate.
*   **Indispensability of Carlos T. Go Sr. to the Deportation Proceedings:** Whether the actions of the Board of Immigration prejudiced Carlos by questioning his citizenship without making him a party in the case.

**Outcome:**

*   **G.R. Nos. 167569 and 167570 (Carlos and Jimmy Go's petitions):** Denied. The Court of Appeals decision upholding the deportation proceedings is affirmed.
*   **G.R. No. 171946 (BI's petition):** Granted. The Court of Appeals decision enjoining Jimmy T. Go's deportation is reversed.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court upheld the Bureau of Immigration's authority to proceed with deportation proceedings against Jimmy T. Go.  The court rejected arguments of prescription, failure to implead an indispensable party, and lack of due process. The court determined that the evidence presented by Jimmy and his father, Carlos, was insufficient to oust the BI of its jurisdiction. The Court reiterated that a deportation proceeding cannot be stopped unless the evidence substantiating a claim to Philippine citizenship is irrefutable.
