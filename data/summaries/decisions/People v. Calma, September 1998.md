## Legal Document Summary: People v. Calma, G.R. No. 127126, September 17, 1998

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision - Appeal from RTC conviction.

**Subject Matter:** Rape (Art. 335, RPC as amended by RA 7659) and Acts of Lasciviousness (Art. 336, RPC in relation to Sec. 5(b) of Art. III of RA 7610) against a father accused of abusing his three daughters.

**Key Provisions:**
*   **Criminal Charges:** Accused Rodrigo Calma was charged with two counts of rape (Crimes Cases 752-M-96, 753-M-96) for incidents against his daughters Annalyn and Roselyn and one count of Acts of Lasciviousness (Crime Case 754-M-96) against his daughter Irene.
*   **RTC Verdict:** Rodrigo Calma was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on all three counts.
*   **Penalties (RTC):** Death penalty for each rape count, reclusion temporal in its medium period for Acts of Lasciviousness. P50,000 indemnity, P50,000 moral damages, and P25,000 exemplary damages were awarded to each victim.
*   **Defense Argument:** The Accused claimed the charges were fabricated by the victims due to coaching from the mother, stemming from marital issues and motivated by property gain. The Defense asserts the improbability of certain actions on the Accused's part and the consistency of actions between the Accused and the victims.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision, finding overwhelming evidence of guilt. Increased the civil indemnity to P75,000 for the rape convictions.

**Obligations:**
*   Accused is obligated to serve the imposed sentences (death for each rape charge, *reclusion temporal* for acts of lasciviousness).
*   Accused is obligated to pay the indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

**Liabilities:**
*   Criminal liability for rape and acts of lasciviousness under the Revised Penal Code as amended by RA 7659 and RA 7610 respectively.
*   Civil liability for damages suffered by the victims.

**Potential Risks:**
*   **Death Penalty:** The most significant risk is the execution of the death penalty, though the Supreme Court noted that the records will be forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise of pardoning power.
*   **Appeal to Clemency:**  The court mentions sending the records to the President for a possible pardon, which is a mitigation strategy, not a legal risk, in itself.

*   **People v. Dusohan, 227 SCRA 87:** States a daughter of tender age would not accuse her father of rape if it were untrue.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Points:**
*   **Internal Ejaculation Argument:** Defense raises the lack of internal ejaculation as evidence. The Supreme Court refutes, stating it's not determinative of rape.
*   **Show of Affection:** The defense attempts to use the children's continued affection towards the father as evidence of innocence. The Supreme Court dismisses this, citing the victims' testimonies about cutting classes and crying in the library.
*   **Medical Evidence:** The defense tries to undermine the medical evidence (hymenal lacerations) by suggesting alternative causes. The Supreme Court finds the defense failed to establish these alternative causes occurred.

**Overall Assessment:** The Supreme Court strongly affirmed the RTC's conviction, finding overwhelming evidence supporting the guilt of the accused. The Court emphasized the credibility of the victims' testimonies and the corroborating medical evidence. The limited possibility of clemency remains the only potential avenue for mitigation.
