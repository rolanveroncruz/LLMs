**Legal Document Summary: *Panlilio v. COMELEC & Pineda***

**Case:** G.R. No. 181478, July 15, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, questioning COMELEC orders related to an election protest.

**Parties:**

*   Petitioner: Eddie T. Panlilio (Protestee/Governor)
*   Respondents: Commission on Elections (COMELEC) and Lilia G. Pineda (Protestant)

**Background:**  Pineda filed an election protest against Panlilio after he was proclaimed governor. The COMELEC's Second Division gave due course to the protest, ordered revision of ballots. Panlilio's subsequent motions for reconsideration and certification to the En Banc were denied.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **COMELEC Orders in Dispute:**
    *   Order giving due course to Pineda's election protest and directing revision of ballots.
    *   Order denying Panlilio's motion for reconsideration.
    *   Order denying Panlilio's omnibus motion to certify the reconsideration motion to the COMELEC En Banc and stay the collection of ballot boxes.
*   **Panlilio's Arguments:**  The COMELEC En Banc gravely abused its discretion by denying his omnibus motion. The COMELEC should have dismissed Pineda's protest outright because it was allegedly a "sham" and insufficient.
*   **COMELEC's Position:** The assailed orders of the Second Division were interlocutory; therefore, Panlilio's motion for reconsideration was correctly resolved by the Second Division, and did not require certification to the En Banc.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court DISMISSED Panlilio's petition for certiorari.

**Legal Analysis & Statutory References:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** COMELEC has exclusive original jurisdiction over election contests for regional, provincial, and city officials (Article IX-C, Section 2(2), 1987 Constitution).
*   **Interlocutory vs. Final Orders:** Only final orders of the COMELEC in Division can be elevated to the En Banc. Interlocutory orders are resolved by the Division that issued them (Section 5(c), Rule 3, COMELEC Rules of Procedure).
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** Section 5, Rule 19 of the 1993 COMELEC Rules of Procedure governs motions for reconsideration of decisions of a COMELEC Division.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Defined as a capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Not found in this case.
*   **Election Protest Sufficiency:** Allegations requiring perusal, examination, or counting of ballots necessitate ordering the opening of ballot boxes. Similar allegations were considered sufficient in *Homer Saquilayan v. COMELEC* and *Dayo v. COMELEC*.
*   **Objections Before Board of Election Inspectors:** Not a prerequisite for the COMELEC to acquire jurisdiction over an election protest. Section 255 of the Omnibus Election Code states that the court shall immediately order the ballots to be examined and the votes recounted where allegations in a protest so warrant.

**Case Law:**

*   *Repol v. COMELEC* (G.R. No. 161418, April 28, 2004): Addressed the issue of interlocutory orders and the proper procedure for motions for reconsideration.
*   *Gementiza v. Commission on Elections*: Explained the requirement of finality before an act of a Division can be elevated to the COMELEC En Banc.
*   *Miguel v. COMELEC* (G.R. No. 136966, July 5, 2000):  Addressed allegations of fraud and irregularities in election protests.
*   *Quintos v. Commission on Elections*: Addressed allegations of fraud and irregularities in election protests
*   *Estrada v. Sto. Domingo* (No. L-30570, July 29, 1969) and *Benito v. Commission on Elections* (G.R. No. 106053, August 17, 1994): Emphasize the importance of speedy resolution of election contests.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Protracted Litigation:** Even though the Supreme Court dismissed the petition, the underlying election protest could continue, leading to further legal expenses and uncertainty regarding the governorship.
*   **Factual Issues:** The Supreme Court deferred to the COMELEC's findings regarding the sufficiency of the protest and the need for ballot revision. The accuracy of the initial vote count remains a contested factual issue.
*   **No Specific Risk:** The Supreme Court ruled that the COMELEC En Banc did not gravely abuse its discretion.
