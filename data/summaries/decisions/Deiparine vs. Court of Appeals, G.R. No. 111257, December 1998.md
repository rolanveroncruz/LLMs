## Legal Document Summary: Deiparine vs. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 111257)

**Nature:** Partition of real estate, declaration of nullity of deeds, cancellation of title, and damages.

**Subject Matter:** Lot 1938 of the Talisay-Minglanilla Friar Lands Estate, Cebu, originally owned by Marcelo Deiparine.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Co-ownership Established:** The Court affirms the Court of Appeals' decision that the heirs of Marcelo Deiparine's children (Francisca, Filomena, Salvador, Supriana, Segundo, Justiniana, Macaria and Manuel Deiparine) are co-owners of Lot 1938-A in equal shares *per stirpes*. The Court of Appeals found that the heirs of Manuel Deiparine failed to prove exclusive ownership of Lot 1938-A.

*   **Lot 1938-B Ownership:** The Court declared the 6/9 portion of Lot 1938-B is owned by defendants heirs of Justiniana Deiparine (5/9 portion by virtue of the deed of sale, dated October 28, 1933, and 1/9 portion by succession), while the remaining 3/9 portion is owned in common by the heirs of Segundo Deiparine, Macaria Deiparine and Salvador Deiparine who did not consent to the contract of sale.

*   **TCT Nullification:** TCT No. RT-3834 (NA) issued in the name of Manuel Deiparine is declared null and void. The Court found the reconstitution proceedings fraudulent, particularly the misrepresentation that no litigation was pending.

*   **Accounting Ordered:** Defendants (heirs of Manuel Deiparine and Justiniana Deiparine) are ordered to render an accounting of their use and enjoyment of Lots 1938-A and 1938-B from the filing of the complaint.

*   **Partition Required:** Parties are ordered to submit a project of partition over Lots 1938-A and 1938-B based on the Courtâ€™s determined sharing proportions.

**Obligations:**

*   **Defendants:** Provide accounting of Lot 1938-A and 1938-B usage from the complaint filing date.
*   **All Parties:** Submit a partition project to the trial court for approval, aligning with the court-defined ownership percentages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Heirs of Manuel Deiparine are liable for the use and enjoyment of property belonging to co-owners.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Partition Disputes:** The partition project's approval could lead to further disputes if agreement on specific boundaries/allocations cannot be reached.
*   **Accounting Accuracy:** Disputes regarding the accounting of profits generated from the property are possible.
*   **Enforcement:** Enforcing the accounting and partition orders may require further legal action.
