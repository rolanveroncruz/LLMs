**Legal Document Summary: *National Transmission Corporation vs. Commission on Audit***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 227796, February 20, 2018 (826 Phil. 405)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 assailing COA Decision No. 2016-278, affirming the disallowance of a portion of separation benefits paid to Mr. Alfredo V. Agulto, Jr.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Disallowance:** COA disallowed P22,965.81 of Agulto's separation benefits, representing the period when his employment status was contractual (March 1-15, 2004).
*   **EPIRA Law (RA 9136) Section 63 and COA Rule 33:** The COA based the disallowance on the interpretation that contractual employees are entitled to separation benefits under the EPIRA Law only if their appointments were approved or attested to by the Civil Service Commission (CSC).
*   **Liability:** The COA initially held both Agulto and the members of TransCo's Board of Directors solidarily liable for the refund.
*   **TransCo's Arguments:** TransCo argued that the separation benefits were lawful under the EPIRA Law, Corporation Code, and TransCo's Board Resolutions.
*   **Good Faith:** While the COA initially absolved Agulto based on good faith, they later reversed this ruling, finding it not applicable.

**Ruling and Obligations:**

*   **Petition Partly Granted:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the COA's disallowance of the separation benefits, finding no grave abuse of discretion by COA. The SC cited *National Transmission Corporation v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 223625, November 22, 2016* as precedent.
*   **No Refund Required:** Despite affirming the disallowance, the SC modified the ruling, holding that Agulto and TransCo's Board of Directors are *not* required to refund the disallowed amount. This was based on TransCo's prior reliance on *Lopez*, and the principle that passive recipients acting in good faith are absolved from refunding disallowed disbursements.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of EPIRA and COA Rules:** The core contention revolves around the interpretation of Section 63 of the EPIRA Law and Rule 33, specifically the requirement of CSC approval or attestation for contractual employees to be eligible for separation benefits. This may be a point of contention in future similar cases.
*   **Good Faith Exception:** Although the Board of Directors were not made to refund, future cases might not be as lenient, especially if reliance on previous jurisprudence is found to be unreasonable or if they were deemed not to be acting in good faith.
*   **Solidary Liability:** The application of solidary liability is fact-dependent and can shift based on circumstances and the specific roles and responsibilities of individuals involved.
