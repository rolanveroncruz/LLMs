**Case:** *Rogelio Garalde Mendaros, et al. v. Lazada E-Services Phil., Inc./Allan David Ancheta*

**Citation:** G.R. No. 257821, August 19, 2024

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, ruling that the petitioners (motorcycle riders) were regular employees of Lazada and were illegally dismissed.  The CA had affirmed the NLRC's and Labor Arbiter's (LA) decisions, which found no employer-employee relationship based on "Independent Contractor Agreements."

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Independent Contractor Agreements:**  Lazada hired petitioners under agreements stating no employer-employee relationship existed and were effective for one year. Clause 6 was breached by Romeo.
*   **Duties of Contractors**: Contractor will provide logistics and delivery services to the company during reasonable hours and times as the Company may from time to time request. The method by which Contractor is to perform such Services shall be as instructed by, and within the discretion and control of, the Company.
*   **Termination:** Lazada discontinued some agreements prematurely.
*   **Dispute:**  Petitioners filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, money claims, damages, and attorney's fees.
*  **Economic dependence**: In case the Contractor cannot comply with its obligations on any given day according to the schedule dictated by the Company, the Company shall not pay the Contractor for that particular day.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Lazada:**  Found liable for illegal dismissal.  Ordered to:
    *   Reinstate petitioners to former/equivalent positions.
    *   Pay backwages from dismissal to reinstatement, including allowances and benefits.
    *   Pay 10% of total judgment awards as attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Stare Decisis:** The Court relies heavily on *Ditiangkin v. Lazada E-Services Philippines, Inc.* (G.R. No. 246892, September 21, 2022) and *Borromeo v. Lazada E-Services Philippines, Inc.* (G.R. No. 265610, April 3, 2024), cases with substantially similar facts and issues, applying the principle of *stare decisis*. This establishes precedent for similar cases against Lazada or other companies using similar "independent contractor" arrangements.
*   **Misclassification of Employees:**  The decision emphasizes that regardless of contractual language, the true nature of the relationship determines employment status.  Reliance on "Independent Contractor Agreements" will not shield employers from labor law obligations if the reality is an employer-employee relationship.
*   **Control Test:**  The Court emphasizes that control over the *means and methods* of work, not just the result, is the critical factor.  Run sheets, daily time logs, and performance evaluations can indicate control even if presented as "guidelines."

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 295 (280):**  Classifications of employment (regular vs. casual).
*   **Civil Code, Article 1700:**  Labor contracts are imbued with public interest.
*   *Career Philippines Shipmanagement, Inc. v. Serna*, 700 Phil. 1 (2012): Parameters for reviewing Rule 45 petitions in labor cases.
*   *Ditiangkin v. Lazada E-Services Philippines, Inc.*, G.R. No. 246892, September 21, 2022: Found Lazada riders to be regular employees.
*   *Borromeo v. Lazada E-Services Philippines, Inc.*, G.R. No. 265610, April 3, 2024: Applies *Ditiangkin* using *stare decisis*.
* *Brent School, Inc. v. Zamora*, 260 Phil. 747 (1990): Fixed term employment must be agreed upon with more or less equal terms with no moral dominance exercised by the former or the latter.
*   **Four-fold Test:**  Selection and engagement, payment of wages, power to dismiss, and power to control.
*   **Economic Dependence Test:**  Whether the worker is dependent on the alleged employer for continued employment in that line of business.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Independent Contractor" Designation:** The Court disregarded the "Independent Contractor" designation in the agreements, finding it to be a misrepresentation of the actual employment relationship.

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the importance of properly classifying workers and the risks associated with misclassifying employees as independent contractors. Lazada faces significant liability for illegal dismissal and must comply with labor law obligations. Other companies using similar arrangements should review their practices to ensure compliance and mitigate potential legal exposure.
