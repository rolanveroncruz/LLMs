**Legal Document Summary: *Mago v. Peñalosa-Fermo* (A.M. No. MTJ-08-1715)**

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint against Judge Aurea G. Peñalosa-Fermo for Gross Ignorance of the Law/Procedure and Bias.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   Complainant Mago filed a grave coercion complaint (Crim. Case No. 04-7800) against Sheriff Angeles. Angeles filed a counter-charge of grave threats against Mago (Crim. Case No. 04-7811).
*   Mago alleges irregularities in the handling of both cases by Judge Peñalosa-Fermo.
*   **Critical Issue:** Respondent Judge delegated portions of the preliminary investigation in the grave threats case (Crim. Case No. 04-7811) to the court stenographer. This included using pre-prepared questions and allowing witnesses to study and write out answers, justified by the Judge as convenient.
*   The OCA found Judge Peñalosa-Fermo liable for unfamiliarity with basic rules on preliminary investigation.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Judge's Obligation:** To personally conduct preliminary investigations, exercising her discretion and not delegating it to others. See *Benamira v. Garrucho, Jr., G.R. No. 92008, July 30, 1990*.
*   **Liability:** Judge Peñalosa-Fermo found guilty of Gross Ignorance of the Law or Procedure under Section 8, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Erosion of Public Confidence:** The delegation of judicial functions undermines the integrity of the process and public trust.
*   **Due Process Violation:** Improper preliminary investigation potentially violates the accused's rights.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 112, Sections 4 (pre-amendment)** - Outlines the requirements for preliminary investigation and the necessity of personal examination.
*   **Rule 140, Sections 8 & 11(A) of the Rules of Court:** Defines Gross Ignorance of the Law as a serious charge and prescribes sanctions.
*   **A.M. No. 05-8-26-SC (effective October 3, 2005):** Removes the power of first-level courts (MTC) to conduct preliminary investigations.
*   *Benamira v. Garrucho, Jr., G.R. No. 92008, July 30, 1990* This case cited by the Supreme Court establishes the principle that discretionary duties entrusted to an officer cannot be delegated.
*   *Garay v. Bartolome, A.M. No. MTJ-08-1703, June 17, 2008* This case cited by the Supreme Court defines the seriousness of Gross Ignorance of the Law.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the court acknowledges the Judge's good faith in trying to expedite the process, good faith is not a defense to gross ignorance of the law.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the OCA's finding of Gross Ignorance of the Law or Procedure, and imposed a fine of P20,000 on Judge Peñalosa-Fermo. The key issue revolves around the improper delegation of duties during a preliminary investigation.
