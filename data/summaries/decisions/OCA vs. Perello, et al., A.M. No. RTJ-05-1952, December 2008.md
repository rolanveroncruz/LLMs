## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-05-1952

**Case:** Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Norma C. Perello, et al.

**Nature:** Administrative matter arising from a judicial audit of Regional Trial Court, Branch 276, Muntinlupa City, focused on irregular disposition of *habeas corpus* petitions.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Judge Norma C. Perello (Judge):** Found guilty of **Gross Ignorance of the Law and Abuse of Discretion** due to improper grant of *habeas corpus* petitions.
    *   Specifically, the Judge prematurely released prisoners convicted under R.A. No. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972) by misinterpreting the penalty ranges outlined in *People v. Simon, G.R. No. 93028, July 29, 1994, 234 SCRA 555*, and disregarding the rules on the graduation of penalties by only considering the minimum period of imprisonment.
    *   The Court found that the Judge ordered releases without requiring copies of detention orders or judgements of conviction, violating Section 3(d) of Rule 102 of the Rules of Court.
    *   The Court noted previous administrative infractions by the Judge, indicating a pattern of misconduct.
*   **Atty. Luis Bucayon II (Clerk of Court):** Charges dismissed as moot and academic due to his transfer to the Public Attorney's Office and clearance from OCA.
*   **Thelma Mangilit, Cecilio Argame, Maricar Eugenio, and Radigunda Laman (Court Stenographers):** Found guilty of **Simple Neglect of Duty** for failing to transcribe stenographic notes and attach them to case records, violating Administrative Circular 24-90. Their argument that *habeas corpus* proceedings are non-adversarial was rejected.
*   **Paul M. Resurreccion (Court Interpreter):** Found guilty of **Simple Neglect of Duty** for failing to prepare and attach Minutes of court sessions, despite his claim to have completed the task as it did not contain his remarks.

**Obligations:**

*   Judges must possess a thorough understanding of the law and jurisprudence, including the rules on the graduation of penalties and the requirements for *habeas corpus* petitions.
*   Court personnel, including stenographers and interpreters, have a duty to diligently perform their assigned tasks, such as transcribing notes and preparing minutes.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Judge:** Fined P40,000.00 to be deducted from retirement benefits. Prior history of administrative violations considered.
*   **Stenographers and Interpreter:** Each fined P5,000.00 and sternly warned against future similar conduct.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The dismissal of charges against the Clerk of Court might be contentious if there's evidence suggesting active involvement in the irregular practices.
