**Case Summary: *Re: Inhibition of Judge Eddie R. Rojas*** (A.M. No. 98-6-185-RTC, October 30, 1998)

**Core Issue:** Whether Judge Eddie R. Rojas violated Rule 137, §1 of the Rules of Court by sitting in a criminal case (People v. Tauro) where he previously served as public prosecutor.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 137, §1, Rules of Court:** Explicitly prohibits a judge from sitting in any case where they have been counsel for a party *without* the written consent of *all* parties, signed and entered on the record.
*   **Definition of "Sit":** Broadly interpreted to include *any* act of a judicial nature, not just hearing evidence. This includes resolving motions and issuing orders.
*   **Canon 2 & 3, Code of Judicial Conduct:** Judges must avoid even the *appearance* of impropriety and administer justice impartially.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Rojas was found to have violated Rule 137, §1. He sat in the case from Nov 12, 1996 to April 13, 1998 without the required written consent.
*   He was fined P10,000.00. A repetition could result in more severe action.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Judge's Defense:** Judge Rojas argued he didn't recall his prior involvement until scrutinizing the TSN (Transcript of Stenographic Notes). He also argued he didn't conduct a "full-blown trial." The court rejected these arguments.
*   **Lack of Objection from Previous Counsel:** The judge's reliance on the lack of objection from previous counsel for the accused was deemed insufficient. The rule requires *written* consent from *all* parties, not simply a lack of objection.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 137, §1, Rules of Court:** The central statutory reference.
*   **Lorenzo v. Marquez, 162 SCRA 546 (1988):** Cited as precedent where a judge was dismissed for a similar violation. However, distinguished by the fact that the Rojas case was confined to the failure of inhibitation and not other misconduct.

**Ambiguities/Contentions (already addressed by the Court):**

*   **Definition of "Sitting":**  The court clarified this to include actions beyond just hearing evidence.
*   **Excuse of Lack of Memory:** The Court did not accept the Judge's explanation regarding failure to recall the prior involvement as prosecutor. The Court noted that counsel's appearances are noted in the record.

**Legal Precision & Concision:**

The ruling emphasizes the *strict* application of Rule 137, §1 and reinforces that a judge's duty to recuse themselves in conflict situations is paramount, regardless of a lack of objection from parties or the stage of the proceedings. The court will look beyond excuses like lack of memory to ensure compliance. The case sets a clear precedent that judges must actively identify and address potential conflicts of interest, even if the prior involvement was years prior. The appearance of impartiality is as critical as actual impartiality.
