**Legal Document Summary: *Dacdac v. Ramos, A.M. No. P-05-2054***

**Nature:** Administrative case against Sheriff Victor C. Ramos for dereliction of duty.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Case:** Action for support (S.P. PROC. No. SC-1904) filed by Dacdac on behalf of her minor daughter against Alvarado. Judgment in favor of Dacdac.
*   **Writ of Execution:** Issued on July 16, 2003, leading to a public auction of Alvarado's property on November 14, 2003. Dacdac was the highest bidder.
*   **Crux of the Complaint:** Ramos refused to issue a certificate of sale despite a court order (February 23, 2005) directing him to do so.
*   **Ramos' Defense:** He awaited the resolution of Alvarado's counsel's Manifestation and Plaintiff council Ex-Parte Motion to strike out the manifestation, requesting to hold the execution in abeyance.
*   **OCA Finding:** Ramos was remiss in his duties, guilty of dereliction, and acted in disrespect/defiance of the court order. No restraining order was in place, making his delay unjustified.
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed OCA finding. Sheriff's duty to execute a writ is ministerial and must be done with diligence and dispatch. Cited *Sps. Morta v. Judge Bagagñan, 461 Phil. 312, 322-323 (2003)* and other related cases.
*   **Rationale:** Delay prejudiced Dacdac's minor daughter by preventing her from consolidating ownership, possessing the property, or selling it to fund expenses.
*   **Applicable Law:**
    *   Section 25(d), Rule 39 of the Revised Rules on Civil Procedure.
    *   Section 33, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.
    *   Section 7, Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118.
    *   Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.

**Obligations:**

*   A sheriff has a *ministerial* duty to execute writs of execution promptly and diligently, unless restrained by a court order.
*   The sheriff is obligated to issue the certificate of sale after an execution sale without undue delay. The one-year redemption period starts upon registration of the certificate of sale.

**Liabilities:**

*   Ramos found guilty of simple neglect of duty.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Reasonable Speed":** The court emphasizes "reasonable speed," but the delay in this case was significant (nearly four years). The definition of "reasonable speed" can be subjective and may vary depending on the circumstances.
*   **Reliance on Pending Motions:** Ramos' argument that he was awaiting resolution of pending motions was rejected. This highlights the risk of a sheriff unilaterally deciding to delay execution based on potentially meritless or delaying motions.
*   **Impact of Delay:** The court stressed the prejudice caused by the delay. This underscores the potential for damages claims against a sheriff for negligent or intentional delays in execution.

**Conclusion:**

This case reinforces the mandatory and ministerial nature of a sheriff's duty to execute writs. Undue delay, even in the face of pending motions, can result in administrative liability. This decision serves as a warning to sheriffs regarding the importance of expeditious execution and the potential consequences of failing to do so. The lack of a restraining order is the deciding factor for the Supreme Court.
