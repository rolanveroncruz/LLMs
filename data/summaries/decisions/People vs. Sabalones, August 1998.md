## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Sabalones*, G.R. No. 123485 (1998)

This Supreme Court decision affirms the Court of Appeals' conviction of Rolusape Sabalones and Artemio Timoteo Beronga for two counts of murder (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code) and three counts of frustrated murder (Art. 248 in relation to Art. 50, Revised Penal Code) arising from a shooting incident.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Positive Identification:** Eyewitnesses positively identified Sabalones and Beronga as perpetrators. Alibi defenses rejected due to proximity to the crime scene and failure to prove physical impossibility of presence.
*   **Treachery:** Found to be a qualifying circumstance for murder, as victims were ambushed and had no opportunity to defend themselves.
*   **Extrajudicial Statement:** Beronga's extrajudicial statement was deemed admissible as it complied with constitutional requirements and corroborated by other evidence (Jennifer Binghoy's testimony). Res inter alios acta rule held inapplicable.
*   **Flight as Evidence:** Sabalones' flight after the incident considered circumstantial evidence of guilt.
*   **Aberratio Ictus/Error in Personae:** The court found the accused mistook the identity of the victims
*   **Penalties:** Modified by the Supreme Court:
    *   Murder: *Reclusion Perpetua* for each count, plus P50,000 indemnity to the heirs of each deceased victim.
    *   Frustrated Murder: 8 years of *prision mayor* (minimum) to 14 years and 8 months of *reclusion temporal* (minimum) for each count. Actual damages awarded to each victim based on proven medical expenses.

**Obligations:**

*   Sabalones and Beronga are jointly and severally liable for the monetary awards.
*   Authorities are directed to bring the at-large co-accused, Eufemio Cabanero, to justice.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal Liability: Conviction for two counts of murder and three counts of frustrated murder, resulting in imprisonment.
*   Civil Liability: Monetary damages awarded to the victims' heirs (for murder) and the injured victims (for frustrated murder) based on actual expenses

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Witness Credibility:** The appellants challenged the witnesses' credibility and the possibility of positive identification given the circumstances (darkness, ducking for cover). The court, however, found the eyewitness accounts credible.
*   **Defense of Alibi:** The Court viewed the alibi defense skeptically.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 248, Revised Penal Code:** Murder
*   **Art. 50, Revised Penal Code:** Penalty for frustrated crimes.
*   **Rule 124, Section 13, Rules of Court:** Requirement to certify cases to the Supreme Court when *reclusion perpetua* is imposed.
*   **Rule 130, Section 30, Rules of Court (Res Inter Alios Acta):** The Act or Declaration of a conspirator
*   **People v. Dolar, 231 SCRA 414 (1994):** Natural reaction of victims to observe assailants.
*   **People v. Tidula, GR No. 123273, (1998):** Relevance of custodial investigation violations.
*   **Positive Identification:** Upheld the trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
