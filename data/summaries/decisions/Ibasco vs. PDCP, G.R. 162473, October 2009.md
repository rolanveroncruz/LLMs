**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Ibasco vs. PDCP***

**Case:** *Spouses Santiago E. Ibasco and Milagros Ibasco and Prime Feeds, Inc. vs. Private Development Corporation of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 162473, October 12, 2009)

**Nature of Document:** Resolution denying a Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals Decision that affirmed the dismissal of a complaint for injunctive relief to stop foreclosure proceedings.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan Agreement & Mortgage:** Santiago Ibasco obtained a loan from PDCP secured by a mortgage on four parcels of land.
*   **Default & Foreclosure:** Ibasco defaulted on the loan, leading PDCP to initiate extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **Injunction Sought:** Petitioners (Ibasco, his wife, and Prime Feeds, Inc. as assignee of one of the mortgaged properties) sought an injunction to prevent the foreclosure, alleging delay in the loan release.

**Obligations:**

*   **Ibasco:** Obligated to repay the loan to PDCP according to the terms of the loan agreement.
*   **PDCP:**  Had the right to initiate foreclosure proceedings upon Ibasco's default as per the mortgage contract.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Ibasco:** Liable for the outstanding loan amount and associated costs.
*   **Petitioners:** Liable for legal fees and costs associated with the failed attempt to secure an injunction.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Alleged Delay in Loan Release:** Petitioners' primary argument revolved around PDCP's alleged delay in releasing the loan proceeds. While potentially a ground to challenge the loan agreement, the Court found that the delay occurred during the negotiation phase and was cured when Ibasco accepted the loan proceeds without protest. Case law such as *Naguiat v. Court of Appeals* relating to lack of consideration was distinguished.
*   **Finality of CA Decision:** The Supreme Court noted that the petition was filed out of time, rendering the Court of Appeals' decision final and precluding review on procedural grounds. This highlights the importance of adhering to prescriptive periods under the Rules of Court.
*   **Validity of Mortgage:**  The Court reiterated the principle that a mortgage's validity is tied to the underlying loan agreement (*Filipinas Marble Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court*). As the loan's validity was upheld, so was the mortgage.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Section 3, Rule 58 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Outlines the grounds for issuing a preliminary injunction, emphasizing the need for the applicant to be entitled to the relief demanded.

**Case Law:**

*   **Filipinas Marble Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court (226 Phil. 109 (1986)):** Affirms the accessory nature of a mortgage contract to a principal loan contract.
*   **Naguiat v. Court of Appeals, (459 Phil. 237 [2003]):** Cited concerning claims for lack of consideration but was distinguished, implying that a claim of delay is different.

**Ambiguities & Contentious Points:**

*   While the petitioners claimed delay in the release of loan proceeds, the court considered the delay to have occurred during the negotiation stage, a distinction that effectively negated the petitioner's claim. It can be argued whether that delay caused damages.
*   Whether the 23-year delay in the foreclosure petition is reasonable was not discussed.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the lower courts' decisions. The key issue was the validity of the mortgage, which hinged on the validity of the underlying loan agreement. The Court found that the alleged delay in releasing the loan was insufficient to invalidate the agreement. The petition was also denied on procedural grounds due to the late filing of the motion for reconsideration. This case reinforces the importance of complying with procedural rules, the validity of accessory contracts, and the need for strong evidence to support claims of delay or impropriety in loan agreements.
