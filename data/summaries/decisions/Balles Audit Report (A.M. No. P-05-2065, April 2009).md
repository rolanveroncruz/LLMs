## Legal Document Summary: A.M. NO. P-05-2065

**Case:** Report on the Financial Audit Conducted on the Books of Accounts of Mr. Agerico P. Balles, MTCC-OCC, Tacloban City.

**Summary:**

This is an administrative case against Agerico P. Balles, Clerk of Court of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) of Tacloban City, arising from a financial audit conducted by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) covering the period from October 1, 1989, to September 30, 2004. The audit revealed significant shortages and irregularities in the handling of court funds.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Shortages:** The audit uncovered shortages in the Fiduciary Fund (P213,466.87), uncollected marriage solemnization fees for the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) and Special Allowance for Judges Fund (SAJF) (P12,814.00 and P86.00 respectively), and unremitted bet money collections (P18,031.75).
*   **Unaccounted Transactions:** Unidentified withdrawals and deposits appeared in Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) passbooks, and unreported/unrecorded collections were noted in the Fiduciary Fund.
*   **Non-Compliance with Circulars:** Balles failed to comply with Supreme Court (SC) Circular Nos. 13-92 and 5-93 regarding the immediate deposit of fiduciary collections with authorized government depositaries (Land Bank). He also violated provisions of the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court. Specifically, he failed to immediately deposit collections, issued temporary receipts (prohibited), and failed to properly account for and remit interest earned on deposits to the JDF.
*   **Belated Remittance:** While Balles eventually deposited the shortage in the Fiduciary Fund, this did not exonerate him from liability for the delay.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Clerks of Court are obligated to immediately deposit all fiduciary collections with authorized government depositaries (SC Circulars 13-92 & 5-93; 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court).
*   Clerks of Court are responsible for the accurate recording and remittance of all court funds, including interest earned on deposits.
*   Failure to comply with these obligations constitutes gross neglect of duty and potential dishonesty/misconduct.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Gross Neglect of Duty/Dishonesty/Grave Misconduct:** The OCA and ultimately the Supreme Court characterized Balles' actions as gross neglect of duty, potentially coupled with elements of dishonesty and grave misconduct. These are grave offenses under the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292, carrying the penalty of dismissal.
*   **Liability for acts of subordinates:** Balles attempted to attribute some discrepancies (uncollected marriage solemnization fees and confiscated bet money) to other court personnel, which may raise questions of supervisory responsibility and vicarious liability.
*   **Forfeiture of Benefits & Reemployment Ban:** Dismissal for gross neglect of duty carries forfeiture of retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits) and disqualification from reemployment in government service.
*   **Ambiguous or contentious clauses:** The document primarily deals with clear violations of procedural rules. There are no particularly ambiguous clauses, though arguments could be made regarding the intent behind Balles' actions (i.e., whether the delay in remittance was malicious or merely negligent).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **SC Circular Nos. 13-92 and 5-93:** These circulars establish the mandatory procedures for handling court fiduciary funds, requiring immediate deposit with authorized government depositories.
*   **2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court:** Reinforces the requirements of SC Circulars and provides detailed guidelines for accounting of court funds.
*   **Executive Order No. 292 (Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V):**  Defines gross neglect of duty, dishonesty, and grave misconduct as grave offenses, punishable by dismissal.
*   **Gutierrez v. Quitalig, 448 Phil 465, [2003]:** Highlights the delicate function of clerks of courts regarding legal fees.
*   **Office of the Court Administrator v. Julian, February 10, 2005:** Emphasizes that full payment does not exempt an accountable officer from liability for unwarranted failure to fulfill responsibilities.
*   **Report on the Financial Audit Conducted on the Books of Accounts of Atty. Raquel G. Kho, Clerk of Court IV, Regional Trial Court, Oras, Eastern Samar, A.M. No. P-06-2177, June 27, 2006, 493 SCRA 44, 49.:** Highlights that dishonesty carries the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service even if committed for the first time.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court found Agerico P. Balles GUILTY of gross neglect of duty and ordered his DISMISSAL from the service, forfeiture of retirement benefits (except leave credits), and disqualification from reemployment in government service. The Civil Service Commission was ordered to cancel his civil service eligibility.
