## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Llonillo vs. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 246787)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a conviction for Other Deceits under Article 318 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Spouses Llonillo (Petitioners) were accused of defrauding Pedro Joel Caspillo (Complainant) through false representations regarding a "sangla-tira" agreement. Specifically, they allegedly misrepresented that a property was free from encumbrances when it was already mortgaged, and that the Complainant was entitled to rental income as interest, leading the Complainant to lend them PHP 300,000.00.
*   **"Sangla-tira" Agreement:** Spouses Llonillo offered Caspillo a loan where, in exchange for PHP 300,000.00, he would receive monthly rental income from one of their apartment units as interest.
*   **Prior Encumbrances:** Complainant later discovered the property was mortgaged to banks and that Spouses Llonillo had entered into similar agreements with others.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), Regional Trial Court (RTC), and Court of Appeals (CA) all found Spouses Llonillo guilty of Other Deceits.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Reversal:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA's Decision and *acquitted* Spouses Llonillo.
*   **Reasoning:** The prosecution failed to prove *all* the elements of Other Deceits. Specifically, the Complainant admitted knowing about the mortgage prior to entering the agreement, negating the element of fraudulent misrepresentation. Subsequent sangla-tira arrangements were irrelevant as they occurred after the agreement with the Complainant.
*   **No Violation of Rule 112 Section 4, Paragraph 3:** The Supreme Court reiterated *Gomez v. People*, where the court held that the lack of the chief city prosecutor's signature in the information is a mere procedural defect that doesn't affect the trial court's jurisdiction, which can be waived by the accused.
*   **Civil Liability:** Despite the acquittal, the Supreme Court held Spouses Llonillo *civilly liable* for the PHP 300,000.00 loan *ex contractu*. The failure to timely pay back the PHP 300,000.00 loan constitutes damage, giving rise to a civil action.
*   **Interest:** Spouses Llonillo was ordered to pay the principal amount of the PHP 300,000.00 loan, plus legal interest of 12% per annum from April 10, 2013 until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until finality of this Decision. The total amount due shall earn interest of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment.

**Key Legal Issues & Potential Risks:**

*   **Elements of Other Deceits (Art. 318, RPC):** The decision highlights the requirement for *contemporaneous or prior fraudulent acts* to establish deceit. The burden rests with the prosecution.
*   **Fraudulent Concealment:**  The definition of "fraudulent concealment" in light of the Complainant's knowledge (or lack thereof) about the property's encumbrances at the time of the agreement is central to the determination of liability.  The SC decision relies heavily on the Complainant's admission.
*   **Civil Liability After Acquittal:** The ruling addresses when civil liability survives a criminal acquittal. The civil action survives when the acquittal is based on a reasonable doubt (as only preponderance of evidence is required in civil cases); where the court expressly declares that the liability of the accused is not criminal but only civil in nature; and, where the civil liability does not arise from or is not based upon the criminal act of which the accused was acquitted.
*   **Basis of Civil Liability:** *De Leon, Jr. v. Roqson Industrial Sales, Inc.* established that the "act or omission" from which liability arises is based on obligations independent of the delict. These obligations are those enumerated in Article 1157 of the Civil Code: law, contracts, quasi-contracts, and quasi-delicts.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Whether the evidence on record already warrants the award of civil liability based on a separate source of obligation in the same criminal case, or whether a separate action is necessary.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Gomez v. People:** This case overturned previous doctrines holding the absence of a city prosecutor's signature on the Information to affect the court's jurisdiction.
*   **Osorio v. People:** Defined the elements of Other Deceits.
*   **Marcos v. People:** Elaborated on the definitions of "false pretense" and "fraudulent concealment."
*   **Padilla v. Court of Appeals:** Courts can adjudge civil liability in the same criminal case where acquittal is pronounced. *En Banc* decision. Civil liability is not extinguished where the acquittal is based on reasonable doubt, or the civil liability doesn't arise from the criminal act.
*   **First Producers Holdings Corporation v. Co:** Accused may invoke all defenses pertaining to their civil liability in the criminal action.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 318, Revised Penal Code (Other Deceits)
*   Article 1157, Civil Code (Sources of Obligations)
*   Article 29, Civil Code (Civil Action After Acquittal)
*   Rule 111, Section 1, Rules of Criminal Procedure (Institution of Civil and Criminal Actions)
*   Rule 120, Section 2 of the Rules of Court (contents of Judgement.)
*   Art. VIII, Section 4(3) of the Constitution

**Potential Risks & Considerations:**

*   The decision emphasizes that the Supreme Court may inquire into the civil liability of the accused in the same criminal case where the judgement of acquittal was pronounced despite the absence of criminal liabilility. This is subject to the consideration of due process.
*   The dissenting opinions suggest potential due process violations arising from conflating criminal and civil proceedings, potentially depriving the accused of adequate notice and the opportunity to present specific defenses against the *civil* claim.
*   The inconsistent application of civil liability after acquittal needs clarification. Does the evidence in the case already on record warrant the award of civil liability based on a separate source of obligation in the same criminal case, or must a separate action be instituted?
