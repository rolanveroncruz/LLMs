## Summary of Flores v. Sumaljag, A.M. No. MTJ-97-1115

**Nature:** Administrative case against retired Judge Antonio C. Sumaljag for gross ignorance of the law relating to preliminary investigation and arrest of the complainants.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Falsification Charges:** Complainants, Sangguniang Pambarangay members, were charged with falsification of public documents (Art. 171, pars. 2, 4, & 8, RPC) related to a resolution protesting a land application.
*   **Preliminary Investigation Procedure (Rule 112, Rules of Criminal Procedure):** Complainants alleged the judge failed to establish probable cause, did not examine the complainant in some cases, and failed to ask “searching questions” during the preliminary examination.
*   **Warrant of Arrest:** Complainants challenged the issuance of the arrest warrant, claiming it lacked the required justification that it was necessary "in order not to frustrate the ends of justice" (Rule 112, Sec. 6(b), Rules of Criminal Procedure).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judicial Duty:** Judge has the duty to conduct a thorough preliminary investigation, ensuring probable cause exists and the arrest is necessary to prevent frustration of justice. The judge is liable for failing to properly exercise this discretion.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Abuse of Discretion:** The judge's determination of probable cause and necessity of arrest must not be tainted with grave abuse of discretion or malice.
*   **Violation of Due Process:** Failure to properly examine complainants and witnesses, or ask searching questions, may violate due process rights of the accused.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Art. 171:** Defines falsification of public documents.
*   **Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 112:** Governs preliminary investigations and issuance of arrest warrants.
*   **Rule 110, §5:** Who must prosecute criminal actions.
*   **Angcog v. Tan, 227 SCRA 137, 143 (1993):** Determination of probable cause is judgmental and not necessarily a cause for disciplinary action unless grave abuse of discretion or malice is present.
*   **Samulde v. Salvani, Jr., 165 SCRA 764, 741 (1988):** Discretionary to issue an arrest warrant even after examination if it is necessary to arrest the accused in order not to frustrate the ends of justice
*   **Mantaring v. Roman, 254 SCRA 158 (1996):** A judge was reprimanded for issuing a warrant without any finding that it was necessary to place the accused in immediate custody in order to prevent a frustration of justice.
*   **Gallo v. Cordero, 245 SCRA 219, 226 (1995):** Pending administrative action continues even with retirement of official.
*   **Spouses Bacar v. Judge de Guzman, A.M. No. RTJ-96-1349, April 18, 1997; Bayog v. Hon. Natino, G.R. No. 118691, April 17, 1997:** Only appropriate penalty that could be imposed on a retired judge for failure to do his job is a fine.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Searching Questions and Answers":**  The definition of "searching questions" and the extent to which a judge can rely on leading questions, particularly when dealing with reticent witnesses. The court ultimately found the questioning adequate, but the initial assessment suggested potential deficiencies.
*   **"Necessity...in order not to frustrate the ends of justice":**  The interpretation and application of this phrase, specifically the lack of explicit justification for the arrest in this case. The court found the judge's failure to consider this element to be a violation.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court found the judge liable for failing to properly consider the necessity of arrest under Rule 112, Sec. 6(b). A fine of P5,000.00 was imposed, to be deducted from his retirement benefits.
