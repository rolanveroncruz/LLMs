**Legal Document Summary: *Citibank, N.A. vs. National Labor Relations Commission and Rosita Tan Paragas*, G.R. No. 159302, August 22, 2008**

**Nature:** Resolution denying respondent Rosita Tan Paragas' Motion for Leave to Admit (Attached Second Motion for Reconsideration) and Second Motion for Reconsideration (MR).

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Procedural Issue:** Respondent filed a second Motion for Reconsideration (MR) after the first was denied.  Philippine procedural rules generally disallow second MRs. Respondent argued for an exception based on justice and public interest, citing instances where the Supreme Court suspended rules.
*   **Notice to Counsel:** The Court reiterated the established principle that notice to counsel of record (M.M. Lazaro & Associates) constitutes notice to the client (Rosita Tan Paragas). Paragas' lack of communication with her counsel does not negate this.
*   **Grounds for Second MR (Respondent's Arguments):**
    *   Petitioner's motion for extension and petition were previously denied with finality.
    *   Claim for retirement benefits was included in her position paper.
    *   Labor Arbiter and NLRC did not find serious misconduct.
    *   Petitioner allegedly failed to comply with procedural rules (Section 3, Rule 45; Revised Circular No. 1-88; Supreme Court Circular No. 19-91).
    *   Petitioner's counsel initially failed to indicate attorney roll number.

**Court's Reasoning & Holding:**

*   **Denial of Second MR:** The Court held that respondent failed to demonstrate "extraordinarily persuasive reasons" justifying a second MR.  The Court emphasized that while exceptions to the rule against second MRs exist, the circumstances did not warrant one in this case.
*   **Procedural Arguments Addressed:** The Court stated it had previously addressed the procedural issues raised in the initial motion for reconsideration.
*   **Merits over Technicalities:** Citing *Novelty Philippines, Inc. v. CA* (458 Phil. 36 [2003]), the Court highlighted its policy of prioritizing adjudication on the merits, especially in labor cases where procedural rules are applied suppletorily.
*   **Counsel's Roll Number:** Addressing the argument related to the attorney roll number, the Court referenced *D.O. Plaza Management Corp. v. Co-owners Heirs of Andres Atega* (G.R. No. 158526, December 16, 2004, 447 SCRA 171, 182) clarified that the purpose of the rule is identify counsel and does not warrant dismissal of the case if there is a missing roll number. The initial defect was cured when petitioner provided it in the reply.
*   **Retirement Benefits and Misconduct:** The Court deemed these issues were already extensively discussed in the earlier decision.
*   **RULING:** Motion for Leave to Admit (Attached Second Motion for Reconsideration) and Second Motion for Reconsideration, both dated July 22, 2008, are DENIED.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **Respondent:** Obligated to abide by the initial decision against which her motions sought reconsideration.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Judgment:**  This resolution signifies that the Court considered all attempts to reverse their decision and therefore there is a finality of judgement.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Manaya v. Alabang Country Club, Inc.*, G.R. No. 168988, June 19, 2007, 525 SCRA 140, 147.
*   *Ortigas and Co. Limited Partnership v. Velasco* (254 SCRA 234, 240 [1996])
*   *Somoso v. CA* (178 SCRA 654, 663 [1989])
*   *Novelty Philippines, Inc. v. CA* (458 Phil. 36 [2003])
*   *D.O. Plaza Management Corp. v. Co-owners Heirs of Andres Atega* (G.R. No. 158526, December 16, 2004, 447 SCRA 171, 182 (2004))

**Potential for Appeal:**

*   Given the denial of the second MR, the legal options for appeal are limited, as the court usually renders a judgment final at this stage.
