**Legal Document Summary: *Miranda v. Spouses Mallari***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 218343, November 28, 2018 (844 Phil. 176)

**Nature of Action:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's decision in an *accion publiciana* case (recovery of possession).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Dispute:** Spouses Mallari (judgment creditors) sought possession of a 7.3-hectare property levied and sold at public auction to satisfy a judgment against Spouses Reyes (judgment debtors), the registered owners. Miranda claimed prior ownership based on an unregistered Deed of Absolute Sale from the Spouses Reyes dated March 21, 1996.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Ruled in favor of Spouses Mallari, ordering Miranda to surrender possession and dismissing Miranda's third-party complaint against Spouses Reyes. Relied on the annotation of the Notice of Levy and Certificate of Sale on the TCT.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC, prioritizing the registered levy over the prior unregistered sale, citing Section 51 & 52 of PD 1529. Denied Miranda's breach of warranty against eviction argument due to lapse of time.
*   **SC Ruling:** Granted the petition in part.  Reversed CA and RTC decisions. Held that Miranda had a superior right of possession due to prior acquisition of ownership.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Miranda:** Initially obligated to surrender possession per lower court rulings, which the SC reversed. No liability for damages was imposed.
*   **Spouses Mallari:** Initially entitled to possession based on the execution sale, but that was reversed. They have no legal claim on the subject property.
*   **Spouses Reyes:** No liability to Miranda under the circumstances as the property belonged to Miranda at the time of levy

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Unregistered Sale vs. Registered Levy:** The core issue centers on the conflict between a prior, unregistered sale and a subsequent, registered levy on execution. PD 1529. SC held that judgement debtor only has the right to property he owns at the time of the sale.
*   **Third-Party Complaint:** The dismissal of Miranda's third-party complaint against Spouses Reyes initially left him without recourse against the vendors.
*   **Provisional vs. Conclusive Ownership:** The SC emphasized that the ruling is limited to the right of possession (*accion publiciana*) and is not a final determination of ownership.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Sec. 51 & 52:**  Cited by the CA regarding the effect of registration. *Bayer Philippines, Inc. v. Agana (159 Phil. 953 (1975))*
*   **Civil Code:** Articles 712, 1458, 1475, 1477, 1478, 1497, 1498 regarding sale and transfer of ownership.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Clean Title Assumption:** Reliance on the "clean" TCT at the time of the levy was disputed, given Miranda's claim of prior ownership.
