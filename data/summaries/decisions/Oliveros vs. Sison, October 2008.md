**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Oliveros v. Hon. Dionisio C. Sison*, A.M. No. RTJ-07-2050, October 29, 2008**

**Overview:**
This is a Resolution of the Supreme Court finding Spouses Arleen and Lorna Oliveros guilty of indirect contempt for violating Section 5, Rule 7 of the Revised Rules on Civil Procedure (certification against forum shopping). They failed to disclose to the Supreme Court the filing of a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 97892) questioning the same contempt order that was the basis of their administrative complaint against Judge Sison.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Rule 7, Revised Rules on Civil Procedure (Certification Against Forum Shopping):**  Imposes a duty on parties to disclose pending or prior actions involving the same issues. Specifically, subsection (c) requires the party to report within five (5) days, the filing of a similar action/claim that has been filed, to the court where his/her pleading has been filed.
*   **Obligation to Disclose:** Litigants have a continuing duty to inform the court of related cases, to avoid forum shopping. Failure to comply constitutes indirect contempt.

**Liabilities and Penalties:**

*   **Indirect Contempt:**  Spouses Oliveros were found guilty of indirect contempt for violating the certification against forum shopping rule.
*   **Fine:** A fine of P10,000.00 was imposed, payable within ten (10) days.
*   **Warning:** A repetition of the offense will result in a more severe penalty.
*   **Dismissal of Case:** Rule 7, Sec. 5 dictates failure to comply shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Presumption of Knowledge:** The Court presumes the spouses read and understood the contents of their Petition for Certiorari filed with the CA, including the certification against forum shopping. This could be challenged if the spouses argue they genuinely misunderstood the requirements, though that argument appears weakened by their assistance of counsel.
*   **Judicial Exhaustion Argument:** The Court emphasized that administrative complaints against judges should generally be filed *after* exhaustion of judicial remedies and final resolution of the underlying case. This is based on established case law (*Caguioa v. Laviña*, 398 Phil. 845 (2000); *Equitable PCI Bank, Inc. v. Laviña*, A.M. No. RTJ-06-2001, August 16, 2006). The Court emphasizes that disciplinary proceedings are not a substitute for ordinary and extraordinary judicial remedies.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Rules on Civil Procedure, Rule 7, Section 5:** The core provision violated.
*   **Regalado v. Go, G.R. No. 167988, February 6, 2007, 514 SCRA 616, 627:** Defines contempt of court.
*   **Peña v. Aparicio, A.C. No. 7298, June 25, 2007, 525 SCRA 444, 454:**  Explains the rationale for the certification requirement.
*   **Leonidas v. Supnet, 443 Phil. 53, 66 (2003):**  Highlights the penalties prescribed for non-compliance.
*   **Caguioa v. Laviña, 398 Phil. 845 (2000):** The court emphasized that disciplinary proceedings and criminal actions against a judge are not complementary or suppletory of judicial remedies, and should only occur after these remedies have been exhausted.
*   **Equitable PCI Bank, Inc. v. Laviña, A.M. No. RTJ-06-2001, August 16, 2006:** Affirms Caguioa.

**Ambiguities:**

*   While the Court found that the spouses’ failure to disclose was a deliberate act, an argument could be made that the spouses may have reasonably believed there was no need to disclose the CA case as they were not seeking inconsistent reliefs. However, this argument is weakened by the express requirements of Rule 7, Section 5, and the presumption that lawyers informed their clients of the rule's existence.

**Conclusion:**
The ruling hinges on the strict interpretation of the certification against forum shopping rule and the duty of parties to disclose related cases. The Court emphasizes the need for exhausting judicial remedies before resorting to administrative complaints against judges. The finding of indirect contempt appears well-supported by the documented failure to disclose the related case.
