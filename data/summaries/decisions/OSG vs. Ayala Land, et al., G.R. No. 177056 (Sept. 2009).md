## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 177056

**Case Name:** *The Office of the Solicitor General vs. Ayala Land Incorporated, Robinson's Land Corporation, Shangri-La Plaza Corporation and SM Prime Holdings, Inc.*

**Issue:** Whether respondents (mall operators) are obligated to provide free parking spaces in their malls to patrons/the general public under the National Building Code (PD 1096) and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals and RTC rulings that the respondents are *not* obligated to provide free parking spaces.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **OSG Argument:** Section 803 of the National Building Code, read in conjunction with Rule XIX of the IRR, mandates free parking to safeguard "life, health, property, and public welfare" (Section 102, National Building Code).
*   **Court's Rejection:**
    *   Section 803 and Rule XIX only prescribe minimum parking space requirements (ratio of slots to shopping floor area). Neither provision mentions parking fees. The term "parking fees" is absent in the entire National Building Code and its IRR. Cites Art. 1158 of the Civil Code.
    *   Section 102 of the National Building Code is limited to the "framework of minimum standards and requirements" for buildings and structures, not a general grant of regulatory power.
    *   Rule-making power must be confined to the details of carrying the enacted law into effect and can not amend or expand the statutory requirements or embrace matters not covered by the statute. *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals, 327 Phil. 1048, 1052 (1996)*.
*   **OSG Relied on Police Power:** Police power does not include the power to prohibit. In totally prohibiting respondents from collecting parking fees from the public for the use of the mall parking facilities, the State would be acting beyond the bounds of police power.
*   **Taking without Just Compensation:** Prohibiting respondents from collecting parking fees is tantamount to a taking or confiscation of private property without just compensation in violation of their property rights. *City Government of Quezon City v. Judge Ericta, 207 Phil. 648 (1983)*.

**Case Law:**

*   **Distinguished** *Republic v. Gonzales (G.R. No. 45338-39, 199 SCRA 788 (1991))* and *City of Ozamis v. Lumapas (160 Phil. 33 (1975))*, which involved government regulation of parking in public streets, not private parking facilities.

**Statutory References:**

*   **National Building Code (PD 1096):** Sections 102, 803
*   **IRR of the National Building Code:** Rule XIX
*   **Civil Code:** Article 1158
*   **Administrative Code of 1987:** Sec. 35, Chapter 12, Title III (Powers and Functions of the OSG)

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **None noted.** The Court's reasoning appears sound and well-supported.

**Overall:** This decision reinforces the principle that obligations derived from law must be expressly stated. The case also highlights the limitations on the government's police power and the need for just compensation when private property is effectively taken for public use. The decision provides a clear legal basis for mall owners to collect parking fees, absent explicit statutory provisions to the contrary.
