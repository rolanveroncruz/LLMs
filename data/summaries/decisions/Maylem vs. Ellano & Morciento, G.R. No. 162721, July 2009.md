## Legal Document Summary: *Maylem v. Ellano and Morciento*

**Case:** *Petronila Maylem v. Carmelita Ellano and Antonia Morciento* (G.R. No. 162721, July 13, 2009)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the Court of Appeals decision affirming DARAB decision, which upheld the Provincial Adjudicator's decision in favor of the tenant (Abad) for recovery of possession of agricultural land.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Tenancy & Emancipation:** Bonifacio Abad was a tenant since 1963. In 1988, he was awarded the land under P.D. 27 and issued Emancipation Patents (EPs) and Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs).
*   **Surrender of Possession:** In 1990, Maylem persuaded Abad to temporarily surrender possession for one year. Maylem refused to return the land after the period.
*   **Retention Attempt:** Maylem sought to exclude her landholdings from agrarian reform and filed a petition for retention (granted in 1999 for a different parcel), arguing the current land should be included.
*   **Complaint for Recovery:** Abad filed a complaint for recovery of possession with the Provincial Adjudicator of the DAR.
*   **Defense:** Maylem argued that proceedings should be suspended until the retention petition was resolved and later claimed Abad had waived his rights for consideration.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** The Provincial Adjudicator, DARAB, and Court of Appeals all ruled in favor of Abad, citing his ownership based on the EP and TCTs.

**Obligations:**

*   **Maylem:** Obligated to surrender possession and cultivation of the land to Abad (and now, his heirs).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Maylem:** Lower court previously ordered the payment of actual damages, but DARAB removed this order.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Retention Order Scope:** The petition hinges on whether the 1999 DAR Order granting Maylem's petition for retention implicitly cancelled Abad's EP. The Supreme Court finds that it did not, emphasizing it concerned a different parcel and did not explicitly cancel the EP.
*   **Waiver Validity:** Maylem claims Abad waived his rights for consideration. The Court finds such a waiver invalid under P.D. 27 and R.A. 6657, which prohibit the transfer of awarded lands except by hereditary succession or to the government.
*   **Prescription:** Maylem argued that Abad's action had prescribed under the agrarian reform law, which was dismissed by the courts due to Abad's ownership of the property.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. 27 (Emancipation of Tenants):** Governs the transfer of land to tenants and prohibits transfer of land award
*   **R.A. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Section 27 mirrors the prohibition on transferring awarded lands.
*   ***Castellano v. Spouses Francisco***: Defines "abandonment" as a ground for cancellation of an emancipation patent.
*   ***Omadle v. Casuno***: Discusses the inapplicability of prescription under agrarian reform law when emancipation patent has been issued.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Compromise Agreement between Maylem and Abad, specifically the clause referencing the DAR Order directing the cancellation of emancipation patents, is contentious. The Supreme Court rejects it, finding no such directive within the DAR Order itself.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied Maylem's petition, affirming the decisions of the lower courts. The core legal issue revolved around the validity and effect of the emancipation patent issued to Abad. The Court definitively ruled that the EP vested absolute ownership in Abad, and any subsequent attempts to circumvent this, including the alleged waiver and the interpretation of the retention order, were invalid.
