## Legal Document Summary: *Dizon v. Tuazon*, G.R. No. 172167 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) ruling that declared a Deed of Absolute Sale, Affidavit of Non-Tenancy, and Agreement of Subdivision null and void due to forgery.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Core Dispute:** Validity of a Deed of Absolute Sale (1985), Affidavit of Non-Tenancy (1985), and Agreement of Subdivision (1990) allegedly executed by Segundo Espinosa (deceased) in favor of Respondents (Tuazon). Petitioners (heirs of Espinosa) claim forgery; Respondents claim valid transfer due to financial assistance given by them to Segundo to prevent foreclosure of property mortgage with PNB.
*   **Forgery Allegations:** Petitioners alleged that the signatures of Segundo Espinosa on the disputed documents were forged. The NBI report gave a definite conclusion as to the Agreement of Subdivision, and a less definitive conclusion as to the other two documents.
*   **Notarization:** The documents were notarized, creating a presumption of regularity in execution.

**Ruling:**

*   **The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition and affirmed the CA decision** which upheld the validity of the assailed documents.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners (Dizon et al.): Obligated to pay costs.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Factual Findings:** The RTC and CA reached opposite conclusions based on the same evidence. SC acknowledged this conflict as reason for delving into facts typically reserved to lower courts.
*   **Reliance on Expert Testimony:** The SC, while considering the NBI report, emphasized that courts are not bound by expert testimony and must weigh it against other evidence and the Court's own expertise. *Referencing People v. Malejana, 479 SCRA 610, 623 (2006)*.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The notarization of the documents created a strong presumption of regularity, placing a heavy burden on the Petitioners to prove forgery by clear, strong, and convincing evidence. *Referencing Pan Pacific Industrial Sales Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125283 (2006)*.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The SC found the Petitioners' evidence (NBI report, family testimony, barangay records) insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The SC gave greater weight to the testimony of the notary's secretary and the respondents who claimed to have witnessed Segundo signing the documents.
*   **Failure to Present Key Witness:** The SC noted the Petitioners' failure to present Atty. Genilo, the notary public, who could have provided crucial testimony, weakening their case.
*   **Laches/Statute of Limitations:** While not explicitly discussed, the CA noted that the inscription of the sale on the title in 1986 gave Segundo constructive notice, raising a potential argument of laches had it been pursued.

**Statutory References:**

*   Implied reference to the Rules of Evidence regarding burden of proof, presumption of regularity, and admissibility/weight of expert testimony.
*   Civil Code provisions regarding Contracts, Obligations, and Nullity of Contracts (though not explicitly cited, they underpin the legal arguments).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The difference in Segundo's signature on the first page of the Deed of Absolute Sale (abbreviated) compared to the second page (full signature) was contentious but the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court reconciled this difference to the detriment of the Petitioners by believing the testimony that Segundo acknowledged this difference himself and accepted both as valid signatures.

**Case Law:**

*   *Baricuatro, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, 382 Phil. 15, 24 (2000)* - On review of fact when decisions conflict.
*   *People v. Malejana, 479 SCRA 610, 623 (2006)* - On weight of expert witness opinion.
*   *Pan Pacific Industrial Sales Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125283, 10 February 2006, 482 SCRA, 164, 174* - On presumption of regularity in notarized documents.
*   *Causapin v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 107432, 4 July 1994, 233 SCRA 615, 623.* â€“ Regarding accurate forgery examinations dwelling on similarities and differences.
*   *Jimenez v. Commission on Ecumenical Mission United Presbyterian Church, USA , 432 Phil. 895, 911 (2001)* -  Regarding natural variations in a genuine signature made by one and the same person.

**Conclusion:**

The case highlights the difficulty in overturning notarized documents based on allegations of forgery, particularly when credible witnesses support their validity. The presumption of regularity is a significant hurdle, requiring substantial and convincing evidence to overcome. The Petitioners' failure to present Atty. Genilo and to effectively rebut the evidence presented by the Respondents proved fatal to their case.
