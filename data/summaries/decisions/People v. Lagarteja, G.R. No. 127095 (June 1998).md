*   **Court of Appeals Decision:**
    *   **Acquitted Roberto Lagarteja** on all counts due to failure to prove conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt. This acquittal is final.
    *   Modified Lito Lagarteja's Frustrated Murder convictions to lesser offenses (Arresto Mayor to Prision Correctional) in Criminal Case No. 88-63473 and 88-63474, which decisions have become final and executory.
    *   **Upheld Lito Lagarteja's Murder conviction** for the death of Generoso Tipora and recommended affirmation by the Supreme Court.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Affirms the Court of Appeals' recommendation and thus affirms the conviction of Lito Lagarteja for Murder.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Eyewitness Testimony:** The conviction heavily relies on the eyewitness testimony of Elisa Jumatiao, a neighbor of the victim. The defense argued against the credibility of this witness. The court found that the prosecution overcame the argument regarding the witness and provided a sufficient description.
*   **Lack of Direct Evidence of Roberto's Participation:** Roberto's initial conviction was based on a conspiracy theory which was successfully challenged on appeal due to the standard of proof required.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** The element of treachery was crucial in elevating the killing to Murder. The court based its finding of treachery on the suddenness and unexpectedness of the attack, preventing the victim from defending himself.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Definition of Murder:** The Information alleges, and the court affirms, that the killing was committed with intent to kill, treachery, and evident premeditation.
