## Legal Document Summary: *Justimbaste v. COMELEC and Balderian* (G.R. No. 179413, November 28, 2008)

**Case Summary:**

This Supreme Court decision affirms the COMELEC's dismissal of a petition to disqualify Rustico B. Balderian as mayor based on alleged material misrepresentation in his certificate of candidacy. The petitioner, Priscila R. Justimbaste, argued Balderian falsely stated his name and citizenship.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Section 74 & 78 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC):** The case revolves around these sections. Sec. 74 outlines the required contents of a certificate of candidacy, and Sec. 78 provides for petitions to deny due course or cancel the certificate if it contains false material representations.
*   **Material Misrepresentation:** The Court emphasizes that for disqualification under Sec. 78, the false representation must pertain to a *material* matter affecting qualifications for elective office (citing *Salcedo II v. COMELEC, 371 Phil. 377 (1999)*), and must demonstrate a deliberate attempt to deceive the electorate.
*   **Citizenship:** Petitioner alleged Balderian was a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, disqualifying him under Section 40 of the Local Government Code. However, the court noted the evidence was based on mere conjectures and surmises.
*   **Name Discrepancy:** Petitioner claimed Balderian's real name was Chu Teck Siao. The Court acknowledged conflicting records but noted Balderian had a court-approved change of name. It held that using a name other than the one in the birth certificate is not necessarily a material misrepresentation *unless* it affects qualifications for office, citing *Salcedo II v. Commission on Elections*.
*   **Hearing Requirement:** Petitioner argued the COMELEC failed to conduct hearings. The Court clarified that petitions under Sec. 78 of the OEC follow the procedure for nuisance candidates under R.A. 6646, which allows for summary proceedings (position papers, affidavits) instead of mandatory oral hearings.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Candidate's obligation to truthfully represent qualifications in Certificate of Candidacy.
*   Potential liability for material misrepresentation leading to disqualification.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Future challenges to Balderian's qualifications if new, concrete evidence arises.
*   The ruling hinges on the absence of *deliberate* intent to deceive. This subjective element could be a point of contention in future cases.
*   Ambiguity remains regarding the reconciliation of conflicting birth records and the proper recordation of the change of name.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code (OEC), Sections 74 and 78:** Core provisions governing certificate of candidacy requirements and disqualification for material misrepresentation.
*   **Local Government Code (LGC), Section 40:** Disqualification based on dual citizenship or permanent residency in a foreign country.
*   **Republic Act No. 6768:** Defines "balikbayan".
*   **Republic Act No. 6646, Sections 5 and 7:** Procedure for nuisance candidate cases applied to Sec. 78 petitions.
*   ***Salcedo II v. COMELEC, 371 Phil. 377 (1999):*** Key case defining "material misrepresentation" and the required intent to deceive.
*   ***Dayo v. Commission on Elections G.R. No. 94681, July 18, 1991, 199 SCRA 449:*** Election protest may not be disposed of by summary judgment.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "deliberate attempt to mislead" standard is inherently subjective and open to interpretation. This element is crucial in determining material misrepresentation.
*   The decision acknowledges conflicting records regarding Balderian's father's citizenship. While resolved by presuming illegitimacy, this issue could resurface if new evidence contradicts that presumption.
*   The Civil Registrar of Tabontabon had no record of the change of name. While the court says that the McArthur registrar was the one supposed to do it, It could be argued this could cause voter confusion and therefore should qualify as material misrepresentation.
