**Legal Document Summary: Torres v. Rodellas, G.R. No. 177836**

This case concerns a dispute over rights to a 111-square meter parcel of land in Occidental Mindoro, pitting Edwino A. Torres (now deceased, represented by his heirs Alfonso and Fatima Torres) against Balligi V. Rodellas.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Property:** Lot No. 4, Sgs-04-000316-D, Poblacion, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro.
*   **Competing Miscellaneous Sales Applications (MSAs):** Balligi's MSA No. (IV-18) 3524 (filed 1986) and Edwino's MSA No. (IV-18) 3780 (filed based on Affidavit of Relinquishment/Sale of Right).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Office of the President (OP):** Erred in dismissing Torres' Motion for Reconsideration based on Atty. Restor's alleged lack of authority due to Edwino's death. The OP had a duty to order substitution of legal representatives under Rule 3, Section 16 of the Rules of Court, which applies suppletorily to appeals to the OP per Administrative Order No. 18, Series of 1987.
*   **Atty. Restor:** While under a duty to inform the court of his client’s death, his failure to do so does not automatically strip him of authority, or invalidate prior motions.
*   **Heirs of Edwino Torres:** Obligated to comply with substitution requirements under Rule 3, Section 16. The heirs' later Letter of Appointment demonstrates their intention to retain Atty. Restor.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Affidavit of Relinquishment/Sale of Right:** Validity is highly contested, with allegations of forgery. Balligi claims she was in Saudi Arabia when it was supposedly signed. Factual determination of its validity is critical.
*   **Applicability of *Res Judicata*:** The DENR erroneously applied res judicata based on a prior order that did not rule on the merits. The Office of the President correctly reversed this application.
*   **Procedural Issues Regarding Atty. Restor's Authority:** The Court of Appeals initially erred in finding the Motion for Reconsideration was filed late, and further erred in affirming OP’s dismissal based on the attorney-client relationship terminating upon death without allowing for proper substitution.
*   **Issue of Collating and Supervising Attorney’s – Atty. Restor, Atty. Castillo.** The SC makes it clear, absent an actual termination of collating counsel’s authority, that any presumptions on who is in charge will be resolved in favor of properly representing the cause.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 3, Section 16 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Substitution of parties upon death.
*   **Administrative Order No. 18, Series of 1987:** Rules governing appeals to the Office of the President.
*   **Article 1919(3) of the Civil Code**: Dissolution of agency by death of principal. Court clarifies that the implications of this can be averted via Rule 3 S 16
*   **Gonzales v. PAGCOR, 473 Phil. 582 (2004):** Defines when a cause of action survives death.
*   **Bonilla v. Barcena, 163 Phil. 521 (1976):** Further clarifies causes of action surviving.
*   **Heirs of F. Nuguid Vda. de Haberer v. Court of Appeals, 192 Phil. 61 (1981):** Important precedent regarding the death of a litigant and counsel's duties.
*   **Sumaljag v. Literato, G.R. No. 149787, 18 June 2008, 555 SCRA 53**

**Ambiguous and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The exact date of Edwino Torres' death is unclear, making it difficult to precisely determine if Atty. Restor complied with the 30-day notification requirement of Rule 3, Section 16.

**Resolution and Remand:**

The Supreme Court *partially granted* the petition. The Court of Appeals resolutions were reversed insofar as they affirmed the Office of the President's dismissal of the Motion for Reconsideration based on Atty. Restor's lack of authority. The case was remanded to the Court of Appeals to give due course to the Petition for Review, and to determine the validity of Affidavit of Relinquishment/Sale of Right.
