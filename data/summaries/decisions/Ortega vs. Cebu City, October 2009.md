**Case Summary: *Spouses Ortega v. City of Cebu***

**Citation:** 617 Phil. 817 (G.R. Nos. 181562-63, G.R. Nos. 181583-84, October 02, 2009)

**Parties:** Spouses Ciriaco and Arminda Ortega (Landowners/Petitioners/Respondents), City of Cebu (Expropriating Authority/Respondent/Petitioner).

**Facts:** The Spouses Ortega owned land in Cebu City.  The city sought to expropriate half of the land (2,856 sq. m.) occupied by squatters via City Ordinance No. 1519 for a socialized housing project.  The City initially appropriated P3,284,400.00 (P1,150/sq. m.). The RTC declared the City had the right to expropriate and later fixed just compensation at P11,000/sq. m. (totaling P31,416,000.00). The City failed to appeal this decision, rendering it final and executory.  The City then attempted to stay execution, modify the judgment, and withdraw from the expropriation, claiming the just compensation was too high for its beneficiaries. The RTC denied these motions, and the City's account with the Philippine Postal Bank was garnished. The City then contended the garnished funds were earmarked for other purposes and thus exempt. The CA partially granted the City's petition, annulling the orders that denied the motion to stay execution and quashing the garnishment, but affirming the denial of the motion to modify and withdraw. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied both petitions, affirming the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **Finality of Expropriation Order:** The Court held that because Cebu City failed to appeal the initial order of expropriation or the subsequent determination of just compensation, the orders became final and executory. The city could no longer withdraw from the expropriation proceedings.  The Court relied on *Republic v. Phil-Ville Development and Housing Corporation* (G.R. No. 172243, June 26, 2007) which outlined the two stages of expropriation proceedings.

2.  **Just Compensation as a Judicial Prerogative:** The Court reiterated that the determination of just compensation is a judicial function, citing *Export Processing Zone Authority v. Dulay* (G.R. No. L-59603, April 29, 1987). It cannot be dictated by statute or executive order. The Court emphasized the mandatory nature of appointing commissioners to ascertain just compensation, referencing *National Power Corporation v. dela Cruz* (G.R. No. 156093, February 2, 2007) and *Forfom Development Corporation v. Philippine National Railways* (G.R. No. 124795, December 10, 2008).

3.  **Garnishment of Public Funds:** The Court held that garnishment of Cebu City's bank account with Philippine Postal Bank was improper. Although City Ordinance No. 1519 appropriated funds for the expropriation, the account garnished was not specifically opened for that purpose, nor did the ordinance specifically appropriate the funds for payment of just compensation.  Furthermore, the Philippine Postal Bank certified that the account numbers listed in the Ordinance did not exist. Citing *Municipality of Makati v. Court of Appeals*, the Court held that public funds appropriated for a different purpose are exempt from garnishment. This principle derives from public policy: public services should not be paralyzed by diverting funds from their legitimate objects.

**Obligations:**

*   Cebu City is obligated to pay just compensation to the Spouses Ortega based on the final and executory RTC decision.
*   Spouses Ortega are obligated to pursue a *mandamus* action to compel Cebu City's *Sangguniang Panglungsod* to enact an appropriation ordinance for the satisfaction of their claim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Cebu City is liable for the judicially determined just compensation.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement Difficulties:** The Spouses Ortega must pursue a separate *mandamus* action.  Successful enforcement depends on the willingness of Cebu City's *Sangguniang Panglungsod* to appropriate the funds, which remains uncertain given their previous claims of insufficient funds and the already high amount of just compensation to be paid.
*   **Procedural Challenges:** Successfully obtaining a writ of *mandamus* is not guaranteed. The Spouses Ortega must demonstrate a clear legal right to the funds and a corresponding duty on the part of the City Council to appropriate them.
*   **Ambiguity in Account Numbers and Fund Allocation:** The discrepancies between City Ordinance No. 1519 and the actual bank accounts further complicate enforcement.
