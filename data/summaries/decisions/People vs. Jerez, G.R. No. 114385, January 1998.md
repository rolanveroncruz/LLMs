**Case Summary: *People v. Jerez*, G.R. No. 114385 (1998)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court conviction for Robbery with Double Homicide under the Revised Penal Code.

**Facts:** Jerez was convicted of robbing and killing Reynaldo Ochoa and Joselito Balbastro. He was identified as having lured the victims under the pretense of a carabao sale. A signed extrajudicial confession was admitted as evidence. Jerez claimed alibi and that the confession was coerced and his right to counsel was violated.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Crime Charged:** Robbery with Double Homicide. Elements of Robbery (intent to gain, unlawful taking, violence/intimidation) combined with the killing of two individuals.
*   **Extrajudicial Confession:** Admitted into evidence. Critical issue revolves around its voluntariness, compliance with constitutional rights during custodial investigation (Miranda rights), and effective assistance of counsel.
*   **Alibi Defense:** Rejected by the trial court and Supreme Court due to positive identification by witnesses and failure to establish impossibility of presence at the crime scene.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Trial Court Sentence:** *Reclusion Perpetua*.
*   **Damages:** Initially, the trial court awarded specific amounts for death, loss of earning capacity, lost articles, and burial expenses.
*   **Supreme Court Modification:** Upheld the conviction and the death penalty. The Supreme Court modified the damage award for loss of earning capacity, calculating it based on the formula `(2/3 x [80 - age of the victim at the time of death])` resulting in considerably larger sums.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Voluntariness of Confession:** Jerez argued coercion and intimidation. The Court emphasized the presence of counsel and the Mayor during the confession, implying that this negated the claim of duress. However, the effectiveness of counsel is challenged.  The strength of this argument hinges on whether Jerez was truly free to reject Atty. Schneider after he was suggested by Major Rosales when his initial choice was unavailable.
*   **Right to Counsel:** Jerez argued that the counsel provided was not his choice and thus ineffectual. The Court reasoned that since Jerez did not object to the appointed counsel at the time and swore to the statement, he implicitly accepted him. This creates potential risk if the attorney in question was not competent or did not act in Jerez's best interest, raising 6th amendment concerns.
*   **Identification:**  Jerez argued he was not properly identified. The Supreme Court dismissed this based on the positive identification by witnesses.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** While no physical evidence directly linked Jerez (no recovered properties or fingerprints), the confession and eyewitness testimony were deemed sufficient.

**Legal Analysis for Potential Appeal/Review:**

1.  **Validity of the Confession:** Focus on the circumstances surrounding the confession, the "availability" of chosen counsel Venida, and the "suggestion" of Atty. Schneider. Argue whether this constituted a genuine waiver of the right to choose counsel freely. Explore potential conflict of interest of court-appointed attorney.
2.  **Effectiveness of Counsel:**  Investigate whether Atty. Schneider provided adequate representation during the confession and at trial. If ineffective assistance is demonstrable, this could undermine the admissibility of the confession.
3.  **Burden of Proof:**  Challenge the presumption of voluntariness. Argue that the prosecution failed to adequately prove the absence of coercion. Scrutinize the details of the confession for inconsistencies or information the accused wouldn't logically know, supporting a coercion claim.
4.  **Earning Capacity Computation:** While adjusted in this case, ensure the actual basis for the income figure is properly substantiated and compliant with the standards the Supreme Court sets forth.
