**Case Summary: *DAR vs. Abdulwahid and Yupangco Cotton Mills, Inc.* (G.R. No. 163285)**

**Core Issue:** Jurisdiction over a complaint seeking recovery of land covered by CARP. Does the RTC or the DARAB have jurisdiction?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the DARAB, not the RTC, has jurisdiction because the case involves the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) under R.A. No. 6657. The complaint, despite being styled as "Recovery of Ownership and Possession," essentially challenges the CARP coverage and redistribution of land, falling under the exclusive original jurisdiction of the DARAB.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 50, R.A. No. 6657:** Vests the DAR (specifically the DARAB) with primary, exclusive, and original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform. This includes determining and adjudicating agrarian disputes, cases, controversies, and matters related to CARP.
*   **DARAB Rules of Procedure:** Reinforces DARAB's jurisdiction over cases involving CLOAs, EPs, and rights/obligations of individuals engaged in land management/cultivation covered by CARP.
*   **Landowners Obligations**: Landowners must comply with the provisions of CARP and address all objections with the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board

**Liabilities:**

*   **Yupangco Cotton Mills, Inc.:** Improperly filed the complaint with the RTC, leading to dismissal of the case. Could be liable for legal costs if such are ordered.
*   **Buenavista Yupangco Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association, Inc. (BYARBAI):** Liable for damages if found to have violated the terms of the CLOA (e.g., land conversion).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Forum Shopping:** While the RTC case was dismissed, if Yupangco had deliberately chosen the RTC to circumvent DARAB's jurisdiction, they could face sanctions for forum shopping (though not explicitly mentioned as sustained on appeal here).
*   **Prolonged Litigation:** Incorrect forum selection caused delay. Land remains encumbered pending proper adjudication.
*   **Validity of CLOAs/TCTs:** The core dispute revolves around the validity of the CLOAs issued to BYARBAI, placing their rights and title at risk pending a final DARAB determination.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Centeno v. Centeno:** Affirmed DAR's primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters, including CLOA-related cases.
*   **SSS v. DAR:**  Parallel case where SSS tried to avoid DARAB jurisdiction; similarly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
*   **Rivera v. Del Rosario, David v. Rivera, Vda. de Tangub v. Court of Appeals, Morta, Sr. v. Occidental, Heirs of the late Herman Rey Santos v. Court of Appeals, Nuesa v. Court of Appeals:** All cited for re-emphasizing the exclusive jurisdiction of DARAB over agrarian disputes, particularly relating to CLOAs and implementation of CARP.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of what constitutes a matter "involving the implementation of agrarian reform" can be contentious, particularly when claims of ownership and possession are mixed with agrarian law arguments. Here, the Supreme Court pierced the surface of the claim and looked at the substance of the allegations to determine jurisdiction.
*   The allegation of illegal land conversion by BYARBAI is a potential point of contention, as it is a specific violation that could lead to forfeiture of their rights under the CLOA.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Establishes the CARP and grants jurisdiction to the DAR.
*   **R.A. No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code):** Referenced in the original complaint but less central to the jurisdictional issue decided by the Supreme Court.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129:** cited by the RTC as the basis for their jurisdiction.
*   **E.O. Nos. 229, 228, 129-A:** Cited by the court for referencing the scope of CARP and the power of DAR to implement this scope.
