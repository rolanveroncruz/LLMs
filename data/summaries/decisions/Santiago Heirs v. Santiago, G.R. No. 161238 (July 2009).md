# Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Jose G. Santiago v. Aurea G. Santiago*

**Case:** *Heirs of Jose G. Santiago v. Aurea G. Santiago*, G.R. No. 161238, July 13, 2009 (610 Phil. 84).

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the trial court's decision which upheld the validity of a sale of co-owned property.

**Key Facts:**

*   Jose and Juan Santiago were co-owners of a parcel of land.
*   Juan Santiago sold a portion of his undivided share to Mark Vincent L. Ong.
*   Jose Santiago's heirs (petitioners) sought to annul the sale, alleging forgery and lack of capacity on Juan Santiago's part. They also challenged the validity of Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) issued as a result of the sale and subsequent partition attempts.
*   Aurea Santiago, Juan's wife, disavowed profiting from the sale and claimed her husband handled it independently.
*   Ong argued he purchased the property for valuable consideration after obtaining legal advice.
*   The alleged Notary of the deed of sale claims that his signature was forged.
*   Trial court deemed the sale valid, upheld the buyer's TCT, invalidated the TCT for the remaining property issued under both Jose and Juan's names, and directed partition.

**Key Provisions/Holdings:**

*   **Real Party in Interest:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) and trial court's rulings. The SC held that the Heirs of Jose G. Santiago are NOT real parties in interest to challenge the sale because Juan Santiago disposed of *his* undivided share, and Juan Santiago's probate granted Aurea all rights to his properties and properties shares.
*   **Validity of Sale:** The SC upheld the validity of the Deed of Sale, noting the petitioners failed to prove Juan Santiago's incapacity to contract. No evidence was provided proving the claims of the deed being forged.
*   **Validity of TCT:** Mark Vincent L. Ongâ€™s TCT was deemed valid
*   **Partition:** The original TCT, issued in the name of Jose and Juan Santiago covering the remaining portion of the property (20,927 square meters), was deemed to have no legal basis and was invalidated. The estate of Juan Santiago could only claim 5,000 square meters.

**Obligations:**

*   Parties must effectuate a partition of the remaining property according to the Court's decision (Jose Santiago's heirs entitled to remaining one-half of the property).
*   Register of Deeds must cancel the invalid TCT and issue a new one reflecting the correct shares.

**Liabilities:**

*   There is no finding of liability against any party.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Partition Disputes:** The partition process could be contentious, potentially leading to further litigation if the parties cannot agree on the division of the property. The case hinges heavily on establishing accurate boundaries, which the trial court can adjudicate if the parties themselves cannot agree.
*   **Forgery Claims:** While the court dismissed the forgery claims, the allegation by the notary public presents a lingering question mark. The absence of a definitive finding on the authenticity of the notary's signature could be a point of future contention.
*   **Lack of Capacity**: Although the courts ruled against the petitioner's claim that Juan Santiago was incapacitated at the time the Deed of Sale was signed, the court left the door open for further inquiry into it.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 3, Section 2 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Defines "real party in interest."
*   **Rule 2, Section 2 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Defines "cause of action."
*   **Article 1311 of the Civil Code:** Contracts take effect only between the parties, their assigns and heirs.
*   **Article 1623 of the Civil Code:** Right of legal preemption of co-owners.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The exact square meterage to be assigned to each party in the partition is subject to interpretation based on the court's direction to issue a new title "specifying their respective share in accordance with this decision."
