## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Alapan*, G.R. No. 199527, January 10, 2018

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of a petition seeking imposition of subsidiary imprisonment for non-payment of fines in B.P. Blg. 22 violations.

**Facts:** Respondent Alapan was convicted by the MTC of eight counts of B.P. Blg. 22 and fined P30,000 per count, plus indemnification and attorney's fees, but no imprisonment was imposed. The writ of execution for the fine was returned unsatisfied.  The MTC denied the motion to impose subsidiary imprisonment, stating that the original judgment did not include it. RTC dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, stating the judgement was final. CA dismissed the petition for review because it was filed without the intervention of the OSG.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Conviction:** Respondent convicted of eight counts of B.P. Blg. 22.
*   **Penalty:** Fine of P30,000 per count (total P240,000). Indemnification for the face value of the checks (P411,000) plus legal interest, and P15,000 for attorney fees.
*   **No Subsidiary Imprisonment:** The original MTC judgment did *not* include a provision for subsidiary imprisonment in case of non-payment of the fine.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Financial:**  Obligation to pay the fine, indemnification, interest, and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Immutability of Judgement:** The doctrine of immutability of judgments prevents modification of the final and executory decision of the MTC.

**Key Legal Issues & Case Law:**

*   **Standing of Private Complainant:**  The Supreme Court reiterated in *Bautista v. Cuneta-Pangilinan, 698 Phil. 111 (2012)* that a private complainant's interest in a criminal case is generally limited to the *civil liability* arising from the crime.  Only the Solicitor General (OSG) can appeal the criminal aspect (penalty) of the case.
*   **OSG's Role:** Section 35, Chapter 12, Title III, Book IV of the Revised Administrative Code vests the authority to represent the People of the Philippines in criminal appeals solely in the OSG. As ruled in *Gonzales v. Chavez, 282 Phil. 858 (1992)* the OSG must represent the government.
*   **Subsidiary Imprisonment:** The Court in *People v. Fajardo, 65 Phil. 539 (1938)* held that subsidiary imprisonment *must* be expressly stated in the judgment of conviction.
*   **Administrative Circulars 12-2000 and 13-2001:**  These circulars allowed fines to be imposed instead of imprisonment for B.P. Blg. 22 violations. While Administrative Circular No. 13-2001 states that there is no legal obstacle to the application of the Revised Penal Code provisions on subsidiary imprisonment, compliance with the law is a must.
*   **Due Process:** Imposing subsidiary imprisonment *after* the judgment has become final, and without its explicit mention in the original judgment, violates the accused's right to due process.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interaction between Administrative Circular No. 13-2001 (allowing subsidiary imprisonment) and the *Fajardo* ruling (requiring explicit mention in the judgment) created ambiguity. The Court resolved it in favor of requiring explicit mention to uphold due process and immutability of judgment.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the CA's dismissal. The private complainant lacked standing to challenge the penalty, and the judgment was already final and could not be modified to include subsidiary imprisonment. The absence of a specific provision for subsidiary imprisonment in the original judgment of conviction was fatal to the petitioner's case.
