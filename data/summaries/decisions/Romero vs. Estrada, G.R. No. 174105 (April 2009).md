Here's a concise legal summary of *Reghis M. Romero II, et al. v. Senator Jinggoy E. Estrada, et al.*, G.R. No. 174105, April 2, 2009:

**Case Summary:**

This case is a petition for prohibition filed by Reghis Romero II, et al., challenging the constitutionality of Senate Committee invitations and subpoenas related to an inquiry into the investment of Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) funds in the Smokey Mountain project.  The Petitioners argued that the inquiry was *sub judice* due to the pendency of *Chavez v. National Housing Authority* (G.R. No. 164527), not in aid of legislation (but intended to determine criminal liability), and violated their right against self-incrimination.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Section 21, Article VI, 1987 Constitution:** Power of the Senate to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation.
*   **PS Resolutions 537 & 543:** Directing investigation of OWWA fund investments in Smokey Mountain project.
*   **Sub Judice Rule:** Petitioners argued the Senate investigation was improper due to the pendency of the Chavez case concerning similar facts. The Court ruled that the *Chavez* case was no longer sub judice.
*   **Inquiry in Aid of Legislation vs. Determination of Criminal Liability:** Petitioners claimed the investigation was intended to determine criminal liability (plunder), not to aid in legislation. Court held the investigations were in aid of legistlation.
*   **Right Against Self-Incrimination:** Petitioners claimed the inquiry compelled them to appear and testify, violating their Fifth Amendment rights. Court noted right against self-incrimination can be raised during questioning, not as a blanket bar to appearing.
*   **Mootness:** The Court ultimately dismissed the petition on mootness grounds because the Senate invitations and subpoenas were issued by a prior Congress, and pending matters before a prior congress are not binding on future congresses (citing *Neri v. Senate Committee* and *Garcillano v. The House of Representatives Committees*). Further, the new congress did not resume these investigations.

**Court's Ruling:**

The Supreme Court *DENIED* the petition. It held:

1.  The *Chavez* case was no longer *sub judice*.
2.  Ongoing judicial proceedings do not preclude legislative hearings in aid of legislation (citing *Standard Chartered Bank v. Senate Committee*).
3.  The invitations and subpoenas were *functus officio* (no longer valid) because they were issued by a previous Congress, which acts separately from subsequent Congresses.
4.  The committee was acting pursuant to its authority to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation, and a person subpoenaed must appear and can invoke the right against self-incrimination at the time a potentially incriminatory question is asked.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The ruling reaffirms broad congressional power of inquiry, even when related to matters under judicial consideration.
*   The ruling highlights that the right to remain silent must be asserted on a question-by-question basis rather than as a blanket refusal to appear before a legislative body.
*   While the decision turned on mootness, the Court also addressed the other issues, potentially solidifying precedent on the scope of legislative inquiries.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 8042, "the Migrant Workers Act"**
*   **Sec. 3(d), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court**
