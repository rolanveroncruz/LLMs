**Legal Document Summary: DBP vs. West Negros College, Inc. (G.R. No. 174103)**

**Nature:** Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration regarding the computation of redemption price for a foreclosed property.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Right of Redemption (Sec. 16, E.O. No. 81):** Mortgagor has one year from the date of registration of the certificate of sale to redeem the property by paying "all of the latter's (Bank's) claims against him, as determined by the Bank."
*   **DBP's Right to Possession:** DBP can take possession during the redemption period and is entitled to the fruits of the property, considered as compensation for accruing interest. No obligation to account for the fruits.
*   **Interest Accrual:**  The central issue is whether interest accrues on the debt *after* the date of the public auction. The Court initially ruled (based on prior decisions related to G.R. No. 152359) that interest did not accrue after the auction.  This Resolution *reverses* that stance based on a re-evaluation of E.O. No. 81.

**Obligations:**

*   **West Negros College (WNC):** To pay the balance of the credit secured by the foreclosed properties, plus expenses, and the agreed rate of interest.
*   **DBP:**  To allow redemption within one year. If DBP took possession, the proceeds of the property compensate the interest only during the period of their possession.

**Liabilities:**

*   **WNC:**  Liability for the principal debt, interest *accrued after the auction sale*, and expenses.
*   **DBP:**  Potentially liable to account for fruits if possession was taken *and* if the proceeds exceeded accrued interest, though this scenario is unlikely given the phrasing of E.O. No. 81.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Claims as determined by the Bank":**  This phrase in Sec. 16 of E.O. No. 81 grants DBP significant discretion in calculating the redemption price. This could be challenged if deemed unreasonable or exceeding the scope of the original agreement.
*   **Valuation of "Fruits" if DBP had taken possession:** While DBP isn't *obligated* to account for the fruits, a dispute could arise regarding whether the 'fruits' are sufficient to cover the accruing interest if possession had been taken.
*   **Finality of Previous Judgments (G.R. No. 152359):**  WNC argued that the previous decisions are final. The Court rejects this, arguing that the dispositive portion of the 2002 decision implicitly allows for interest during the redemption period. This argument could be challenged as a misinterpretation of the prior ruling or a violation of res judicata.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **E.O. No. 81, Sec. 16:**  The DBP Charter, specifically the right of redemption provision.
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 459, Sec. 31:**  Predecessor agency's charter, highlighting the deletion of explicit interest accrual language, though the current interpretation reinstates that intent.
*   **G.R. No. 152359 (DBP v. West Negros College, Inc., 439 Phil. 943 (2002)):** Prior case involving the same parties, initially interpreted to limit interest accrual. This resolution clarifies and effectively modifies that interpretation.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "all of the latter's (Bank's) claims," particularly whether it encompasses interest accruing after the auction sale. The Court's reversal suggests this was a highly debated point.
*   The clause related to fruits of the property compensating interest. WNC could argue this is unfair or inequitable if the actual fruits are negligible.

**Conclusion:**

The court reversed the Court of Appeals decision, holding that DBP is entitled to accrued interest even after the foreclosure sale, as long as they did not take possession of the property during the redemption period. This is primarily based on the interpretation of DBP's charter, E.O. No. 81, and a perceived intent to protect the government's investment. There are still potential areas of dispute around the valuation of "claims" and the accounting for "fruits" had DBP taken possession.
