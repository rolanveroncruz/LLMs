## Legal Document Summary: *In Re: Decision Dated September 26, 2012 in OMB-M-A-10-023-A, etc. Against Atty. Robelito B. Diuyan*

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in an administrative case against a lawyer, Atty. Robelito B. Diuyan, stemming from a complaint regarding a notarized Deed of Partition.

**Key Issue:** Whether Atty. Diuyan should be held administratively liable for notarizing a Deed of Partition in 2003 based on the affiants' Community Tax Certificates (CTCs).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court DISMISSED the complaint against Atty. Diuyan.

**Key Provisions and Reasoning:**

*   **Incorrect Application of Law:** The IBP erred in applying the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice to Atty. Diuyan's actions, as the notarization occurred in 2003.
*   **Applicable Law:** The relevant law at the time of notarization was Section 251 of the Revised Administrative Code and Commonwealth Act (CA) No. 465, which only required the presentation of *cedula* (residence certificates, now CTCs).
*   **Compliance with Applicable Law:** Atty. Diuyan complied with the then-applicable law by requiring the presentation of CTCs.
*   **Good Faith:** Atty. Diuyan acted in good faith as a District Public Attorney notarizing the document for indigent farmers. There was nothing facially irregular with the Deed of Partition that would have alerted him to any impropriety.
*   **No Violation of Duty:**  Atty. Diuyan did not violate his duties as a Notary Public in the context of the governing legal framework at the time of notarization.
*   **Reliance on *Mabini v. Atty. Kintanar*:** Cites precedent establishing that a lawyer cannot be held liable for notarization practices permissible at the time they were performed, even if subsequent rules altered those practices.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities (Dismissed):**

*   The initial complaint centered on a potential violation of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, which could have led to revocation of his notarial commission, suspension from practice, and disqualification from being commissioned. These risks were averted due to the Court's ruling.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Administrative Code, Section 251:** Requirement as to notation of payment of residence tax.
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 465, Section 6:** Presentation of residence certificate upon certain occasions.
*   ***Mabini v. Atty. Kintanar***:  Establishes that notarial duties are judged based on the law at the time of performance.
*   **2004 Rules on Notarial Practice (A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC):** (Irrelevant in this case because of timing).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the decision is clear, potential ambiguity existed *before* the ruling regarding the degree of diligence expected of notaries public, particularly those serving indigent clients, prior to the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. This ambiguity was resolved in Atty. Diuyan's favor.

**Conclusion:** The decision underscores the importance of applying the correct legal standards in disciplinary cases against lawyers, particularly concerning notarization practices. The Court's reliance on the law in effect at the time of the complained-of conduct is critical. The good faith of the notary, especially in serving indigent clients, is also considered.
