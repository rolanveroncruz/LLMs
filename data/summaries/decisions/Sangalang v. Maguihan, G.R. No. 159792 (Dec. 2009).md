## Legal Document Summary: *Barangay Sangalang v. Barangay Maguihan* (G.R. No. 159792)

**Nature of the Dispute:** This case concerns a barangay boundary dispute between Barangay Sangalang (Petitioner) and Barangay Maguihan (Respondent) in Lemery, Batangas, specifically regarding properties covered by Tax Declaration Nos. 038-00315, 038-00316, and 038-00317.

**Procedural History:**

1.  **Sangguniang Bayan (SB) Resolution:** Initially, the Sangguniang Bayan of Lemery issued Resolution No. 75-96, recognizing the disputed areas as within the jurisdiction of Barangay Sangalang.
2.  **RTC Appeal:** Barangay Maguihan appealed to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) pursuant to Section 119 of the Local Government Code. The RTC reversed the SB resolution, ruling in favor of Barangay Maguihan.
3.  **CA Appeal:** Barangay Sangalang appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) via Notice of Appeal. The CA dismissed the appeal, holding that the proper remedy was a Petition for Review under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court, as the RTC was exercising its appellate jurisdiction. The CA also cited deficiencies in the appellant's brief.
4.  **Supreme Court Appeal:** Barangay Sangalang appealed to the Supreme Court (SC).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The core issue is the territorial jurisdiction over specific lots.
*   **Choice of Remedy:**  The CA correctly determined that the remedy for appealing a decision of the RTC, acting in its *appellate* jurisdiction (reviewing the SB decision), is a Petition for Review under Rule 42, not a Notice of Appeal under Rule 41. This is consistent with Section 2, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Technicalities vs. Substantial Justice:** Petitioner argued the CA erred in strictly applying procedural rules. The SC acknowledges the trend towards liberal construction of the Rules of Court but ultimately holds that the wrong mode of appeal justified dismissal, despite the public interest involved.
*   **Evidence:** The primary evidentiary issue concerned the weight to be given to differing types of evidence regarding boundaries.  The SC affirmed the RTC's decision to give greater weight to the cadastral map approved by the Director of Lands (from the Land Management Bureau), compared to certifications and tax declarations sourced from the tax assessor's office.
*   **Docket Fees:** Petitioner raised the issue of non-payment of docket fees by the respondent at RTC level, but this was deemed waived and within the RTC's discretion, consistent with *Yambao v. Court of Appeals*, 399 Phil. 712 (2000).
*   **Rule 44 Section 13 Violation:** The CA also cited failure to meet the requirements of Rule 44 Section 13 (re index and page references in briefs). The SC deemed this a less significant issue given the brevity of the brief and record.

**Statutory References:**

*   Section 119, Local Government Code (appeal of sanggunian decisions)
*   Section 118, Local Government Code (jurisdiction over boundary disputes)
*   Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 22
*   Rule 41 and Rule 42, Rules of Court (Modes of Appeal)

**Case Law References:**

*   *Yambao v. Court of Appeals*, 399 Phil. 712 (2000) (Payment of docket fees).
*   *Ong Lim Sing, Jr. v. FEB Leasing and Finance Corporation*, G.R. No. 168115 (Relaxation of Rules of Court for Substantial Justice)

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Strict Application of Rules:** The SC, while acknowledging the need for substantial justice, still sided with a stricter procedural compliance, which might limit the scope of liberal interpretations in similar future cases.
*   **Weight of Evidence:** The reliance on the cadastral map's origin from the Land Management Bureau sets a precedent for prioritizing land survey data over tax records in boundary disputes.
*   **Role of Populace:** The decision clarifies that the residents' opinions within the disputed area do not determine jurisdiction.

**Conclusion:**

The SC *partially* granted the petition by reversing the CA's decision, but only to *affirm* the RTC decision, which favored Barangay Maguihan. This effectively finalized the RTC's ruling that the disputed lots are within the territorial jurisdiction of Barangay Maguihan. The key takeaway is the stringent application of procedural rules regarding appellate remedies and the prioritization of land survey documents over tax records in boundary disputes. The case underscores the importance of adhering to proper procedures when appealing decisions from lower tribunals.
