**Legal Document Summary: *Balbin v. Baranda, Jr.* (A.C. No. 12041)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Mariano Baranda, Jr. for violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) and the Notarial Law.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Violation of Notarial Law & CPR:** Atty. Baranda found guilty of violating the Notarial Law (Act No. 2103) and the CPR. Specifically, he notarized a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage and a Promissory Note despite the absence of one of the signatories, Dolores Balbin. Section 1 of Act No. 2103 requires the Notary Public to certify that the person acknowledging the document is known to him and that he is the same person who executed it, and acknowledged that the same is his free act and deed. Also, Section 2 (b), Rule IV of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice states that "[a] person shall not perform a notarial act if the person involved as signatory to the instrument or document x x x is not in the notary's presence personally at the time of the notarization[.]"

*   **No Conflict of Interest:** The IBP and the Supreme Court found no merit to the complainant's allegations of conflict of interest. The argument that respondent was also counsel for Rapu-Raponhon Lending Company (RLC), the counter-party to the complainants, lacked merit because he was retained *after* the notarization occurred. Furthermore, Section 3, Rule IV of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice provides the disqualifications for notaries public, and respondent did not violate any of them when notarizing the documents.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Notary Public Duty:** The ruling emphasizes the strict duty of a notary public to ensure the personal appearance of signatories to verify their identities and due execution of documents. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of professional responsibility and violates the Notarial Law. *See Coquia v. Laforteza, A.C. No. 9364, February 8, 2017 and Linco v. Lacebal, 675 Phil 160, 167 (2011).*
*   **Penalty:** The Supreme Court imposed the following penalties:
    *   Suspension from the practice of law for six (6) months.
    *   Revocation of his incumbent commission as a notary public.
    *   Prohibition from being commissioned as a notary public for two (2) years.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Disciplinary Action:** A repetition of similar offenses will result in more severe penalties.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 2103 (Notarial Law):** Specifically, Section 1 outlining acknowledgement requirements.
*   **2004 Rules on Notarial Practice (A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC):** Rule IV, Section 2(b) regarding presence of signatories.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):** Implied duty to uphold the law and avoid falsehoods.
*   **Relevant Case Law:** Mentions several cases including *Ferguson v. Ramos*, *Malvar v. Baleros*, *Yumul-Espina v. Tabaquiero*, *Orola v. Baribar*, *Sappayani v. Gasmen*, *Isenhardt v. Real,* *Coquia v. Laforteza,* and *Linco v. Lacebal*, used to determine the appropriate penalty.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The admission by complainants that Dolores placed her signature on the subject documents, although outside the presence of the Notary, may mitigate the seriousness of the offence but does not excuse it. It highlights a potential argument for reduction of the penalty, as the Court considered it.

**Conclusion:**

Atty. Baranda was found liable for failing to comply with the basic requirements of the Notarial Law by notarizing documents without the presence of all signatories. This case serves as a reminder to lawyers acting as notaries public to strictly adhere to the procedures and requirements of notarization to avoid administrative sanctions. The fact that the Complainants ultimately did not dispute that Dolores executed the documents was considered a mitigating factor in the imposition of the penalty.
