**Case Summary: *People of the Philippines v. Judy Sanchez y Baquiras*, G.R. No. 120655 (October 14, 1998)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting the accused-appellant of robbery with homicide under Article 294, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   Accused-appellant (Sanchez) was found guilty by the RTC based on circumstantial evidence for the death of Reynald Paborada and the taking of his wallet, cash (P3,015.00), and necklace.
*   Circumstantial evidence included: proximity to the victim, flight from the scene, inconsistent explanation for bloodstains, and possession of the victim's belongings.
*   The RTC sentenced Sanchez to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly the intent to commit robbery.

**Court's Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) **modified** the RTC decision.
*   The SC agreed that Sanchez was guilty of **Homicide** based on the totality of the circumstantial evidence, as the unbroken chain of events excludes any reasonable doubt regarding the guilt of the accused-appellant for the victim's death.
*   However, the SC held that the prosecution **failed to prove the *animus lucrandi*** – the intent to gain – necessary to establish robbery as the primary motive for the crime.
*   The SC also held that the original criminal design to commit robbery was not duly proven.
*   Because of the lack of a proven intent to commit robbery before the killing, the SC convicted Sanchez of **Homicide and Theft**, not the special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide.
*   The SC sentenced Sanchez to indeterminate penalties for both crimes separately.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 294, par. 1, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons, specifically when homicide is committed by reason or on occasion of the robbery.
*   **Article 309, RPC:** Defines the parameters of the crime of theft.
*   **Article 70, RPC:** Discusses the successive service of sentences.

**Case Law:**

*   The SC cites *People v. Salazar*, 277 SCRA 67 (1997), which emphasizes the need to prove the offender's intent to take personal property before the killing to establish robbery with homicide.
*   *People v. Cabiles, 248 SCRA 207, 219 (1995)*- defines the elements to prove robbery.
*   *People vs. Mangulabnan, et al., 99 Phil. 992, 999 (1956)*- it is immaterial that the death of a person supervened by mere accident.
*   The ruling also referenced *U.S. v. Baguiao*, 4 Phil. 110, 112 (1905), where a person cannot be convicted of *robo con homicidio* because the killing may have just been an afterthought.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** While the SC found sufficient circumstantial evidence for Homicide and Theft, defense counsel could argue the evidence was not strong enough to overcome the presumption of innocence.
*   **Intent:** The crucial element of intent is a significant point of contention. The prosecution's inability to prove the intent to commit robbery before the homicide led to the reduction of the charge.
*   **Degree of Participation:** The document does not explicitly detail evidence linking the accused-appellant to the crime, however, this is the crux of the case.

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   Sanchez is liable for Homicide and Theft.
*   Sanchez must serve indeterminate sentences for both crimes successively.
*   Sanchez is obligated to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the amount of P50,000.00.
*   The stolen money and necklace must be returned to the victim's heirs.
