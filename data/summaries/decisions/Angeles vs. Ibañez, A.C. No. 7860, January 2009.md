## Summary of Angeles vs. Ibañez, A.C. No. 7860

**Nature of the Case:** Disbarment complaint against Atty. Amado O. Ibañez for notarizing an "Extrajudicial Partition with Absolute Sale" (the "Document") without a notarial commission and in the absence of the affiants.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Document:** "Extrajudicial Partition with Absolute Sale" notarized by Atty. Ibañez on February 18, 1979, in Manila.
*   **Complainants' Allegations:** Deny executing the document or appearing before Atty. Ibañez. Allege Atty. Ibañez lacked notarial commission at the time. Claim respondent is using the document to their detriment in RTC proceedings.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Admits notarizing the document but claims he did so as Notary Public of Cavite (not Manila), attributing the "Manila" designation to a clerical error. Claims he notarized it based on the assurance of complainant Rosalina Angeles regarding the authenticity of the signatures and that the other complainants had submitted their residence certificates.
*   **IBP Findings:** Respondent notarized the document without the presence of the affiants and without a notarial commission.
*   **IBP Recommendation:** Disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public for two years and suspension from the practice of law for one year.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Ibañez's Violation:** Violated his oath as a lawyer and the Code of Professional Responsibility by notarizing a document without the presence of the affiants.  This is a direct violation of Section 1 of Public Act No. 2103 (Notarial Law) and Section 2(b) of Rule IV of the Rules on Notarial Practice of 2004.
*   **Liability:** Suspension from the practice of law for one year, revocation of incumbent notarial commission (if any), and prohibition from being commissioned as a notary public for one year.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of the Sale:** The Court notes that the validity of the "Extrajudicial Partition with Absolute Sale" is not the issue in the administrative case, but leaves open the possibility of challenging the validity of the sale in court.
*   **Reliance on Secretary:** The Court explicitly rejects Atty. Ibañez's defense of reliance on his secretary.
*   **Forum Shopping:** The Court rejected the defense of forum shopping, determining the instant case pertained to a different matter than the earlier administrative case (Administrative Case No. 3581).
