## Legal Document Summary: Gegare v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 132264 (1998)

**Nature:** Resolution dismissing a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, which assailed Resolutions of the Court of Appeals (CA) dismissing petitioner's appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Obligation to Pay Docket Fees:** The petitioner (appellant in the CA) failed to pay the required docket fees within the 15-day period after notice from the Clerk of Court of the CA. This is a mandatory requirement for perfecting an appeal.
*   **Rule 50, Section 1(d) of the Rules of Court:**  The CA dismissed the appeal based on this rule, which allows dismissal of an appeal for failure to pay the required docket fee.
*   **Rationale for Dismissal:** The court reiterated the mandatory nature of paying docket fees to perfect an appeal. Failure to do so prevents the appellate court from acquiring jurisdiction. *Rodillas vs. Commission on Elections, 245 SCRA 702* is cited to support this assertion.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration Denial:** Petitioner's motion for reconsideration, citing excusable negligence of prior counsel, was denied. The CA also noted that subsequent motion for clarification was a prohibited pleading.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Appeal:** The primary consequence is the dismissal of the appeal, rendering the RTC decision final and executory. The petitioner lost the opportunity to have the RTC decision reviewed on its merits.
*   **Monetary Liabilities:** The petitioner remains liable to fulfill the judgment of the RTC, including turning over possession of the leased premises, paying reasonable compensation for use of the property, and attorney's fees.
*   **Risk of Certiorari Failure:** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition for certiorari, holding it was an inappropriate substitute for a lost appeal.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 50, Section 1(d) of the Rules of Court:** Basis for CA's dismissal.
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:**  Used inappropriately as substitute for appeal.
*   **Rodillas vs. Commission on Elections, 245 SCRA 702:**  Affirms mandatory nature of docket fees for perfecting appeal and acquiring jurisdiction.
*   **Peo. Vs. Court of Appeals, 199 SCRA 539, 547; Sy vs. Romero, 247 SCRA 187, 193:** reiterate that certiorari cannot substitute for a lost appeal.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The petitioner argued that the CA's initial resolution ("appeal *may* be declared abandoned") was not a definitive dismissal. However, the Supreme Court interpreted the subsequent denial of the motion for reconsideration as confirmation of the appeal's dismissal.

**Overall Assessment:**

The case confirms the strict application of procedural rules regarding the payment of docket fees in perfecting an appeal. The petitioner's failure to comply resulted in the dismissal of his appeal and the inability to seek further recourse via certiorari. The court prioritized adherence to procedural requirements over a consideration of the case on its merits. This highlights the importance of diligent counsel and strict adherence to deadlines in legal proceedings.
