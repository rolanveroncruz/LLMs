## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Ugos* (G.R. No. 181633)

**Case:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming RTC conviction for rape of a 7-year-old stepdaughter.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of the Anti-Rape Law of 1997 (RA 8353) â€“ Rape committed through force and intimidation against a minor (7 years old).
*   **Accused's Defense:** Claims actions were merely acts of lasciviousness, lacking proof of sexual intercourse. Allegations of leading questions during victim's testimony.
*   **Victim's Testimony:** Unequivocal testimony regarding penetration (both digital and penile). Contradiction from mother's initial statement about "fingering."
*   **Medical Evidence:** Supports rape claim via evidence of recent genital trauma (hymenal laceration) and contusions on face.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Ugos):** Found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape and is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua*. Liable for civil indemnity of P50,000 and moral damages of P50,000 to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Minority & Leading Questions:** Risk of challenging the reliability of child's testimony, addressed by referencing the *Rule on Examination of a Child Witness* allowing leading questions in the interest of justice (Sec. 10(c), Rule 132 of the Rules of Court & Sec. 20 of the 2000 Rule on Examination of a Child Witness).
*   **Lack of Corroboration:** Potential risk that the child's testimony may not be credible, but addressed by the *Rule on Examination of a Child Witness*, which states that corroboration is not required if the child's testimony is credible by itself (Sec. 22).
*   **Discrepancy in Testimony:** Contradiction between child's and mother's initial statement. Court prioritizes the child's direct testimony under oath.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8353 (Anti-Rape Law of 1997):** Defines rape, including sexual assault by insertion of any object into the genital orifice.
*   **Rule 132, Section 10(c) of the Rules of Court & 2000 Rule on Examination of a Child Witness:** Rules regarding leading questions for child witnesses.
*   **2000 Rule on Examination of a Child Witness, Sec. 22:** No corroboration needed for testimony of a child witness if credible by itself.
*   ***People v. Mateo*:** Transferred the case to the CA for intermediate review.
*   ***De Castro v. Fernandez, Jr.*:** Affirms the expanded definition of rape, including sexual assault.
*   ***People v. Suarez*:** A rape victim's straightforward and candid account, corroborated by medical findings, is sufficient to convict the accused.
*   Relevant case law cited regarding credibility of rape victim's testimony, presumption against false accusations by minors, weight given to trial court's evaluation of witness demeanor, and proper award of civil indemnity and moral damages.

**Conclusion:**

The court upheld the conviction, finding Ugos guilty of rape based on the victim's credible testimony, supported by medical evidence. While there were potential issues regarding the reliability of child witness testimony and discrepancies in the mother's initial report, the court cited relevant rules and jurisprudence to justify the acceptance of the victim's account and the affirmation of the lower court's decision. The case clarifies the application of the Anti-Rape Law of 1997, particularly regarding the expanded definition of rape.
