**Legal Document Summary: *Cadiente v. Macas*, G.R. No. 161946, November 14, 2008**

**Case Overview:**

This case involves a tort action arising from a vehicular accident. Bithuel Macas, a pedestrian, was severely injured when struck by a Ford Fiera driven by Chona Cimafranca. Cimafranca absconded. The vehicle was registered to Medardo Ag. Cadiente, who claimed to have sold it to Rogelio Jalipa prior to the accident. Jalipa, in turn, claimed to have sold it to Abraham Abubakar. The RTC and CA found Cadiente and Jalipa jointly and severally liable for damages. This appeal to the Supreme Court concerns Cadiente's liability.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 2179, Civil Code:** Addresses contributory negligence. The Court ruled no contributory negligence by the victim.
*   **Vehicle Registration Policy:** Registered owner of a vehicle is primarily responsible to the public for damages caused by the vehicle, even if sold to another party.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Cadiente (Registered Owner):** Held primarily liable based on the principle that the registered owner is responsible to the public for damages caused by the vehicle, irrespective of a prior, unregistered sale. This is based on the rulings from the Supreme Court.
*   **Jalipa (Third-Party Defendant):** The RTC and CA found Jalipa jointly and severally liable together with Cadiente, as he allegedly owned the car when the accident happened.

**Damages Awarded:**

*   P300,000.00 compensatory damages
*   P150,000.00 moral damages
*   P18,982.85 reimbursement of medical expenses
*   P30,000.00 attorney's fees
*   Costs of suit

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Unregistered Sale:** The key issue is the unregistered sale of the vehicle. Cadiente's argument that he sold the vehicle is ineffective against third parties injured by the vehicle, according to existing jurisprudence (e.g., *PCI Leasing and Finance, Inc. v. UCPB General Insurance Co., Inc.* and *Villanueva v. Domingo*).
*   **Joint and Several Liability:** Cadiente's attempts to shift the financial burden to Jalipa were unsuccessful. Cadiente remains jointly and severally liable.
*   **Lack of Contributory Negligence:** The SC affirms that the victim was not contributorily negligent as he was standing where he was supposed to be.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Article 2179, Civil Code:** Contributory Negligence
*   **G.R. No. 162267, July 4, 2008, *PCI Leasing and Finance, Inc. v. UCPB General Insurance Co., Inc.*** Holding the registered owner liable. Citing *Erezo, et al. v. Jepte, 102 Phil. 103 (1957)*.
*   **G.R. No. 144274, September 20, 2004, *Villanueva v. Domingo, 438 SCRA 485*** Further outlining the policy behind registration.
*   **Lambert v. Heirs of Ray Castillon, G.R. No. 160709, February 23, 2005, 452 SCRA 285, 293** Further defining the role of contributory negligence

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions, affirming Cadiente's liability due to his status as the registered owner of the vehicle. The court emphasizes the importance of vehicle registration for public protection and holds that unregistered sales do not absolve the registered owner of liability for damages caused by the vehicle. The risk for Cadiente is the full financial burden of the damages awarded, without recourse against Jalipa.
