## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 2011-05-SC

**Case:** Petition for clemency by Ignacio S. Del Rosario, former Cash Clerk III, dismissed from service for dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Dismissal:** Del Rosario was previously dismissed from service by the Court En Banc on September 6, 2011, for dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, with accessory penalties including forfeiture of retirement benefits and disqualification from government re-employment.
*   **Dishonesty Defined:**  Petitioner misappropriated funds entrusted to him by a retiring Sheriff (Primo) under the guise of processing retirement papers.
*   **Grounds for Dismissal:** Aligned with standards of ethical conduct and decorum outlined for court employees (Floria v. Sunga, 420 Phil. 637, 650 (2001)).
*   **Clemency Denial:** The present petition for clemency is denied.

**Obligations:**

*   Court employees have an obligation to uphold the highest standards of honesty, integrity, morality, and decency.
*   Del Rosario had an obligation to act with transparency and fidelity concerning the funds entrusted to him by Primo.

**Liabilities:**

*   Del Rosario is liable for Dishonesty and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service.
*   He suffers the penalty of dismissal from service, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and disqualification from government re-employment.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Precedent:** This case reinforces the strict standards of conduct expected of court employees and the limited circumstances under which clemency will be granted.
*   **Reputational Harm:** This case serves as a reminder of potential damage a dishonet employee can inflict on the reputation of the Judiciary (Concerned Lawyers of Bulacan v. Villalon-Pornillos, A.M. No. RTJ-09-2183, 14 February 2017, 817 SCRA 440, 446.).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Re: Letter of Judge Augustus C. Diaz, Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 37, Appealing for Judicial Clemency, 560 Phil. 1 (2007):** Establishes guidelines for granting judicial clemency, including proof of remorse and reformation, sufficient time lapse, productive years ahead, potential for public service, and other relevant factors.
*   **Floria v. Sunga, 420 Phil. 637, 650 (2001):** Outlines the ethical standards expected of court personnel.
*   **Concerned Lawyers of Bulacan v. Villalon-Pornillos, A.M. No. RTJ-09-2183, 14 February 2017, 817 SCRA 440, 446:**  Reiterates that judicial clemency is not a right and cannot be granted if it jeopardizes the integrity of the courts.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Reformation":** The court finds the evidence presented by Del Rosario insufficient to prove genuine reformation, highlighting the inherently subjective nature of assessing true remorse and rehabilitation in clemency cases. The Court stated that Del Rosario must prove "in sufficient terms how he has effectively reformed himself".

**Summary Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denies Del Rosario's petition for clemency, upholding his prior dismissal for dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. The Court emphasizes the high standards of conduct required of court employees and the strict requirements for granting judicial clemency, particularly regarding proof of genuine remorse and reformation.  The case serves as a reminder of the potential ramifications for similar misconduct by court personnel.
