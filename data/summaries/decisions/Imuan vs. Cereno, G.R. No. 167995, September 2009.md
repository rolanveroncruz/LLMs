**Case Summary: *Imuan v. Cereno*, G.R. No. 167995 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the RTC decision, concerning a complaint for annulment of document, reconveyance, and damages involving a parcel of land.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Deed of Absolute Sale (1970):** Juana Velasquez (Pablo de Guzman's second wife) sold a parcel of land to respondents (her daughter Soledad and Soledad's husband Juanito Cereno).
*   **Joint Affidavit (1970):** Alfredo de Guzman (Pablo's son from his first marriage) and Teofilo Cendana attested to a lost donation *propter nuptias* from Pablo to Juana.

**Key Facts:**

*   Pablo de Guzman had children from two marriages. Petitioners are grandchildren from the first marriage; respondents are the second wife's daughter and her family.
*   Pablo died intestate in 1936, leaving two parcels of land.
*   Juana, the second wife, sold one parcel to the Cереnos in 1970.
*   Petitioners filed suit in 1999, seeking to annul the sale and recover the property, arguing lack of partition and invalidity of the sale.
*   Respondents claimed ownership through the sale, donation *propter nuptias*, and acquisitive prescription.

**Holdings:**

*   **Supreme Court Affirmed the CA decision:** Ruled in favor of the respondents, upholding their ownership based on acquisitive prescription. The court emphasized the respondent’s continuous, open, peaceful, and exclusive possession in the concept of an owner, in good faith, and with just title for over 29 years.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners (Imuan et al.):** Obligation to prove their claim to the property and rebut respondents' defense of acquisitive prescription. The Court stated that the Petitioners failed to do so.
*   **Respondents (Cereno et al.):** Obligation to prove their possession of the property and that such possession meets the requirement for acquisitive prescription.
*   **Juana Velasquez:** She had the obligation to prove the validity of donation propter nuptias, which she failed to do.

**Liabilities:**

*   **RTC Decision:** Initially ruled against respondents, declaring the sale void and ordering reconveyance and damages.
*   **CA Decision:** Overturned the RTC ruling. No liabilities were imposed on respondents.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA Decision.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Deed of Sale:** The validity of the 1970 Deed of Sale is questionable because Juana was only a co-owner of the estate.
*   **Lack of Partition:** Estate of Pablo de Guzman was never settled. All of his children from both marriages are Co-owners.
*   **Acquisitive Prescription:** The main issue is whether respondents validly acquired ownership through acquisitive prescription.
*   **Laches:** The court cited *laches* due to the petitioners' delay in asserting their rights. This doctrine could face challenges if petitioners argue they lacked knowledge of their rights or were under legal disability.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles relating to intestate succession, co-ownership, acquisitive prescription (Arts. 1117, 1127, 1129, 1134, 1137), and good faith.

**Case Law:**

*   The Decision cites *Heirs of Marcelina Arzadon-Crisologo v. Rañon*, *Calicdan v. Cendaña*, *Director of Lands v. Intermediate Appellate Court*, *Republic v. Court of Appeals*, *Spouses Reyes v. Court of Appeals*, *Heirs of Segunda Maningding v. Court of Appeals*, and *Vda. de Rigonan v. Derecho* regarding the elements of acquisitive prescription, the significance of tax declarations, and the doctrine of laches.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Good Faith" of Respondents:** Whether respondents, particularly Soledad as Juana's daughter, acted in "good faith" considering the questionable nature of Juana's title. The Court relied heavily on the Joint Affidavit as evidence of good faith, despite the document's inherent limitations.
*   **Legal Basis for Joint Affidavit** Whether such Affidavit can prove the donation propter nuptias, to prove good faith by Juana and the respondents.

**Legal Analysis:**

The core legal issue is the validity of the respondents' claim of ownership through acquisitive prescription. The court emphasized respondents' continuous, open, peaceful, and exclusive possession in the concept of an owner, in good faith, and with just title for over 29 years.
