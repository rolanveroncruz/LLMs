## Legal Document Summary: *Sumifru (Philippines) Corporation v. Spouses Cereño*

**Document:** G.R. No. 218236, February 07, 2018 (825 Phil. 743)

**Nature:** Supreme Court Resolution affirming the CA denial of Sumifru's petition for certiorari, thereby upholding the RTC's denial of Sumifru's application for a writ of preliminary prohibitory and mandatory injunction.

**Parties:**

*   Petitioner: Sumifru (Philippines) Corporation (Sumifru), successor-in-interest to Davao Fruits Corporation (DFC).
*   Respondents: Spouses Danilo and Cerina Cereño (Spouses Cereño).

**Key Provisions/Agreements:**

*   Multiple Growership Agreements (PPA and GEPASAs) between DFC/Sumifru and Spouses Cereño.
*   Spouses Cereño obligated to exclusively sell bananas produced on their land to Sumifru.
*   Agreements outline volume and quality specifications for banana production.
*   The GEPASAs have fixed terms, with the Supreme Court pointing out Sumifru's admission that they expired in 2015.

**Obligations:**

*   Spouses Cereño's primary obligation was to exclusively sell bananas to Sumifru as per contract terms.
*   Sumifru was obligated to purchase the bananas conforming to the agreed specifications.

**Alleged Breach/Liabilities:**

*   Sumifru alleges Spouses Cereño breached the contracts by selling bananas to other buyers in 2007 without Sumifru's consent.
*   Spouses Cereño argue they validly terminated the agreements due to Sumifru's alleged gross violations and breaches. This is the core contention disputing Sumifru's right.
*   Sumifru is claiming damage/loss for the failure of Spouses Cereño to perform their contractual obligations.

**Court Rulings/Reasoning:**

*   **RTC:** Denied preliminary injunction, finding no urgency to prevent irreparable injury and ruling that granting the injunction would effectively decide the main case.
*   **CA:** Affirmed the RTC, holding Sumifru failed to demonstrate a clear and unmistakable right and that any injury was compensable by damages. The CA also refused to interfere with the RTC's exercise of discretion.
*   **Supreme Court:** Affirmed the CA. The court held that the following were unmet:
    *   **Clear and Unmistakable Right (Right *in esse*):** The Court agreed with the CA that Sumifru's rights were in serious doubt because the GEPASAs have fixed terms, with the Supreme Court pointing out Sumifru's admission that they expired in 2015, and the Spouses Cereño contest the contracts' validity, claiming termination.
    *   **Irreparable Injury:** The injury was deemed capable of pecuniary estimation because Sumifru claimed cash advances and farm inputs were released to spouses.
    *   Preliminary injunction objectives and maintaining the status quo was also considered with the Court acknowledging that the status quo could no longer be enforced.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Contract Termination:** The core issue is whether Spouses Cereño validly terminated the agreements. This will be decided in the main case.
*   **Definition of "Gross Violations and Serious Breach":** The specific violations alleged by Spouses Cereño that led to their purported termination need to be substantiated.
*   **Damages/Compensation:** If breach is proven, the extent of damages Sumifru can recover (despite the court finding it capable of pecuniary estimation) will be contentious.  Sumifru had alleged losses related to advances made to Spouses Cereño, and allegations of potential suits and damage to reputation.
*   **The effect of the GEPASAs term ending and the validity of contracts after term period**: The court took issue with the agreements term period ending in 2015.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 58, Sections 1 and 3 of the Rules of Court:** Defines preliminary injunction and outlines grounds for issuance.
*   **Liberty Broadcasting Network, Inc. v. Atlocom Wireless System, Inc., 762 Phil. 210 (2015):**  Cited regarding the requisites for preliminary injunction.
*   **Australian Professional Realty, Inc. v. Municipality of Padre Garcia, Batangas Province, 684 Phil. 283 (2012):**  Cited for the principle that disputed rights under a MOA preclude a clear and unmistakable right.
*   **Thunder Security and Investigation Agency v. National Food Authority, 670 Phil. 351 (2011):** Cited because no court can compel a party to agree to a continuation of an admittedly expired contract through the instrumentality of a writ of preliminary injunction.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, primarily because Sumifru failed to establish a clear and unmistakable right to the injunction due to the contested validity of the underlying contracts, Sumifru failed to prove that it was entitled to injunctive relief, and the irreparable injury element was not proven.  The resolution is without prejudice to Sumifru's action for breach of contract and damages, which is yet to be determined after trial. Focus should be given to the merits of underlying contract disputes.
