## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Agustin*, G.R. No. 175325 (2008)

**Overview:** This is a Supreme Court decision affirming with modification the lower courts' conviction of Conchito Agustin for rape, but reducing the charges from two counts of *qualified* rape to two counts of *simple* rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Agustin was charged with two counts of qualified rape under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. Nos. 7659 and 8353. The Informations alleged force and moral ascendancy as the accused was the uncle within the third civil degree of the minor victim.
*   **Facts:** The prosecution presented evidence of two separate instances of rape, occurring on July 7 and July 19, 2001. The victim testified to the acts. Medico-legal evidence corroborated the sexual contact. The defense presented an alibi.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** The trial court convicted Agustin of two counts of qualified rape and imposed the death penalty for each count, as well as civil indemnity and moral damages. The Court of Appeals affirmed.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:**
    *   Affirmed the conviction for *rape* but *modified* the charges to *simple* rape.
    *   Reasoning: While the victim's minority was proven, the *qualifying circumstance of relationship* (uncle within the third civil degree) was **not proven beyond reasonable doubt**. The prosecution only presented the testimony of the mother of AAA to establish the relationship between appellant and AAA. Citing *People v. Mangubat* (G.R. No. 172068, August 7, 2007) and *People v. Balbarona* (G.R. No. 146854, April 28, 2004) the court reiterated the requirement for conclusive proof of such relationships, which cannot be based solely on testimony or admission.
    *   Penalty: Reclusion perpetua for each count of simple rape, in light of R.A. No. 9346 prohibiting the imposition of the death penalty.
    *   Damages: Reduced civil indemnity from P75,000 to P50,000 per count. Increased moral damages from P25,000 to P50,000 per count.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Agustin is obligated to serve a sentence of reclusion perpetua for each count of simple rape.
*   Agustin is liable for civil indemnity of P50,000 per count and moral damages of P50,000 per count.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Relationship:** The case highlights the critical importance of providing *concrete evidence* of the relationship between the accused and the victim when it constitutes a qualifying circumstance in a criminal charge. Mere testimony is insufficient.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The alibi presented was weak due to the proximity between the farm and house, meaning the element of physical impossibility was not met for the alibi to stand. The court heavily weighed the testimony of the victim.
*   **Application of R.A. 9346:** The retroactive application of R.A. 9346, which abolished the death penalty, significantly impacts the final sentence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 266-B:** Defines and penalizes rape, including qualified rape.
