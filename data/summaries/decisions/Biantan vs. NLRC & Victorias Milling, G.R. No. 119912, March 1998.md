## Legal Document Summary: *Felixberto Biantan v. National Labor Relations Commission and Victorias Milling Co., Inc.* (G.R. No. 119912, March 19, 1998)

**Case Summary:** This case involves a claim of illegal dismissal by Felixberto Biantan, a long-time employee of Victorias Milling Co., Inc. (VICTORIAS). Biantan was terminated for his alleged involvement in the anomalous sale of brand new batteries as "deteriorated" or "discarded."

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Termination of Employment:** VICTORIAS terminated Biantan's employment based on allegations of fraud and loss of confidence. The company relied on witness statements, company records, and Biantan's explanation letter to support the termination.
*   **Employee Due Process:** The core issue revolves around whether Biantan was afforded due process during the dismissal process. The Court found that while there was an in-plant investigation, it was inadequate.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Employer Liability for Procedural Due Process Violation:** Despite upholding the legality of the dismissal based on substantial evidence of fraud, the Supreme Court ruled that VICTORIAS failed to provide adequate due process. Specifically, Biantan was not given a formal investigation where he could confront witnesses and present his defense.
    *   This exposes VICTORIAS to liability, albeit limited in this case to nominal damages of P1,000.00, but highlights the importance of adherence to procedural due process, following doctrines enunciated in *Wenphil Corporation v. NLRC, G.R. No. 80587, 8 February 1989, 170 SCRA 69* and *Manila Electric Company v. NLRC, G.R. No. 84282, 6 March 1990, 183 SCRA 51* (cited in the Decision).

*   **Employee Liability for Fraud:** The Court found that Biantan was "principally involved" in falsely identifying and selling brand-new batteries as deteriorated or discarded, using his position in the Salvage and Disposal Section for personal gain.
    *   This exposes Biantan to potential civil and possibly criminal liability, depending on the extent of his involvement and the application of relevant penal laws concerning fraud and theft.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Grounds for Termination:** The dismissal was justified by VICTORIAS based on Art. 297 of the Labor Code (previously Article 282), specifically "fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative." The loss of confidence must be supported by substantial evidence, not mere suspicion.
*   **Due Process Requirements:** *Manila Electric Company v. NLRC* emphasizes the need for an opportunity for the employee to confront witnesses and adduce evidence.
*   **Findings of Fact of Labor Arbiter and NLRC:**  Findings of fact by the Labor Arbiter and NLRC, if supported by substantial evidence, are generally binding on the Supreme Court (*Cabalan Pastulan Negrito Labor Association v. NLRC, G.R. No. 106108, 23 February 1995, 241 SCRA 643*).
*   **Nominal Damages for Due Process Violation:** *Wenphil Corporation v. NLRC* provides precedence for awarding nominal damages for failure to comply with procedural due process in termination cases.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Points to Note:**

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** While the Court affirmed the findings of the Labor Arbiter and NLRC, the evidence presented regarding Biantan's direct involvement may be subject to further scrutiny. His defense hinged on the actions of his superiors, creating a potential "following orders" argument.
*   **Lack of Formal Investigation:**  The absence of a formal investigation with the opportunity for confrontation is a significant issue. While it did not overturn the dismissal, it resulted in a penalty for VICTORIAS.

**Conclusion:**

VICTORIAS successfully defended its decision to terminate Biantan's employment on grounds of fraud and loss of confidence. However, the company failed to provide adequate procedural due process, resulting in an order to pay nominal damages. This case reinforces the importance of both substantive grounds and procedural fairness in employment termination cases.
