## Legal Document Summary - G.R. Nos. 198916-17 and 198920-21

**Case:** Malayan Insurance Company, Inc. vs. St. Francis Square Realty Corporation

**Document Type:** Resolution on Motions for Partial Reconsideration of the Court's Decision dated January 11, 2016

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Central Dispute:**  Determination of "Actual Remaining Construction Cost" (ARCC) to ascertain proportionate ownership of reserved condominium units and parking slots between Malayan (MIC) and St. Francis (SF). Based on a 2002 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).
*   **ARCC Definition:** The Court defines ARCC as the actual expenditures necessary to complete the project in a traditional "construction" sense rather than the "investment" sense.
*   **Value Added Tax (VAT):** (Contentious Point) Initial decision included input VAT in ARCC. Upon motion for reconsideration, the Court reverses its stance, excluding input VAT (P45,419,770.44) from ARCC, reasoning that MIC, as a VAT-registered entity, offset input VAT against output VAT and passed the burden to final consumers, making its inclusion unjust enrichment.

*   **Mathematical/Clerical Errors:**
    *   MIC alleged double exclusion of interest expense and other calculation errors.  MIC is now entitled to 34% of the reserved units and St. Francis is entitled to 66% of the said units. The court maintains that the sum of the items under "Total Exclusions" is P12,761,816.84
        *   A.1: It was determined that Interest expenses was not deducted twice from the ARCC.
        *   A.2 and A.3: After review, the Total Exclusions should be at least 3 items supported by official receipts.
*   **TVI vs. MIC Arbitration Award:**  The court allows P17,807,364.98  from the previous award of P21,948,852.39. Paid to Total Ventures, Inc. (TVI) in CIAC Case No. 27-2007.

*   **Other Costs:**
    *   **Change Orders:** Costs for "change orders not due to reconfiguration" (security, safety, marketability) are disallowed.  *See Schedule 6 of MOA*
    *   **Interior Design:** Net increase in costs for interior design works is allowed with conditions.
    *   **Contingency Costs:** Contingency costs are disallowed because it is not directly related to the completion of the project.
    *   **Post-June 2006 Costs:** Costs incurred after the certified completion date (June 2006) are excluded.

**Obligations:**

*   **MIC:**
    *   Deliver possession and transfer title of reserved units to SF in allocated proportion (66%).
    *   Pay SF its proportionate share of income from reserved units, from June 7, 2006, until the finality of the decision.
    *   Provide full accounting of upkeep expenses, rentals, and other income derived from reserved units awarded to SF.
*   **SF:**
    *   Entitled to 66% ownership of the reserved units and corresponding income.

**Liabilities:**

*   **MIC:** Liable for 6% legal interest per annum on the amounts due to SF, starting from the finality of the decision.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Accounting Disputes:**  Potential for further disagreements during the accounting process regarding upkeep expenses, rentals, and other income.  Legal disputes about what constitutes recoverable expenses are possible.
*   **Enforcement Challenges:**  Enforcement of delivery of title and payment of income shares may require further legal action if MIC is uncooperative.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Doctrine of Stare Decisis**
*   **Article 22 of the Civil Code:** Unjust enrichment.
*   **Section 110 of the National Internal Revenue:** VAT credit.
