**Case Summary: National Power Corporation v. Court of Appeals and PHESCO Incorporated (G.R. No. 119121, August 14, 1998)**

**Facts:** A dump truck owned by NPC, driven by Gavino Ilumba, collided with a vehicle, resulting in deaths and injuries. The heirs of the victims sued both NPC and PHESCO for damages. PHESCO claimed it was merely a contractor supplying workers to NPC, while NPC argued the driver was PHESCO's employee.

**Trial Court Ruling:** The trial court held PHESCO and Ilumba jointly and severally liable for damages, absolving NPC.

**Court of Appeals Ruling:** The Court of Appeals reversed, finding PHESCO to be a "labor-only" contractor, making NPC the employer of Ilumba and liable under Article 2180 of the Civil Code.

**Supreme Court Issue:** Whether NPC, as the principal, is liable for the tort committed by the employee (Ilumba) of its "labor-only" contractor (PHESCO).

**Supreme Court Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding NPC directly, primarily, and solidarily liable with PHESCO and Ilumba.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 2180, Civil Code:** Employers are liable for damages caused by their employees acting within the scope of their assigned tasks.
*   **Labor-Only Contracting:** Defined and prohibited. The "labor-only" contractor is considered an agent of the employer (NPC in this case).
*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** Established between the principal (NPC) and the employees of the "labor-only" contractor (Ilumba).
*   **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU):**  Established NPC's significant control over PHESCO's operations, supporting the finding of a "labor-only" arrangement. Key control elements include approval of the critical path, expenditure rates, manning schedules, pay scales, subcontracting, and equipment procurement.
*   **Direct, Primary, and Solidary Liability:** NPC is directly liable to the injured parties under Article 2180.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Tort Liability:** NPC is liable for the tortious acts of Ilumba due to the employer-employee relationship established through the "labor-only" contracting arrangement.
*   **Financial Liability:** Liable for actual/compensatory damages (originally P954,154.55 but adjusted by CA), attorney's fees, and costs.
*   **Recourse:** NPC has the right to seek reimbursement from PHESCO and Ilumba for damages paid.
*   **Failure to Raise Due Diligence:** NPC's failure to assert the defense of due diligence in the selection and supervision of PHESCO and Ilumba at the trial level bars it from raising this defense on appeal, increasing its exposure.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Article 2180, Civil Code:** Basis for employer liability for employee negligence.
*   **Labor Code & Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code (Section 9(b), Rule VII, Book III):** While relevant for defining "labor-only" contracting, the Civil Code governs tort liability to third parties.
*   **_Filamer Christian Institute v. IAC, 212 SCRA 637 (1992):_** Emphasizes that the Civil Code, not labor law, governs claims for damages caused by employee negligence.
*   **_Cuison v. Norton & Harrison Co., 55 Phil. 18 (1930):_**  Distinguishes between contractors and independent contractors, highlighting liability when the employer retains control.
*   **_PCI Automation Center, Inc. v. NLRC, 252 SCRA 493 (1996) and Philippine Bank of Communication v. NLRC, 146 SCRA 347 (1986):_** Employer-employee relationship between the principal employer and the employees of the “labor-only” contractor is created.
*   **_Associated Anglo-American Tobacco Corp. v. Clave, 189 SCRA 127 (1990):_**Finding that a contractor was a “labor-only” contractor is equivalent to a finding that an employer-employee relationship existed between the owner (principal contractor) and the “labor-only” contractor, including the latter’s workers.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Legal Arguments:**

*   **Definition of "Labor-Only" Contracting vs. Independent Contracting:** The core of the dispute revolved around whether PHESCO was a "labor-only" contractor or an independent contractor.  The MOU was critical in demonstrating NPC's control.
*   **Scope of Employer's Liability under "Labor-Only" Contracting:** NPC argued that its liability should be limited to labor law violations and not extend to tort liability under the Civil Code.  The Court rejected this argument, citing _Filamer Christian Institute._
*   **Defense of Due Diligence:** NPC's failure to raise and prove due diligence in the selection and supervision of PHESCO and Ilumba was a significant strategic error, preventing it from mitigating its liability.

**Note:** NPC should review contracts with contractors to ensure that they are structured in a way that establishes true independent contractor relationships, minimizing control and oversight to avoid vicarious liability for tortious acts. They must be ready to offer evidence that they exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of their contractors.
