**Case Summary: *Edsel Liga v. Allegro Resources Corp.***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 175554, December 23, 2008 (595 Phil. 903)

**Nature:** Petition for Review under Rule 45 assailing the Court of Appeals' Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 86331, an ejectment case.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Lease Chain:** Ortigas leased land to La Paz, who constructed the Greenhills Shopping Arcade (GSA) and subleased stalls. Liga was a sublessee of Unit No. 26. La Paz's lease expired on 31 December 2000.
*   **New Lease:** Ortigas leased GSA to Allegro Resources Corporation on 3 September 2001. Addendum to Agreement specified Allegro's immediate possession and right to collect back rentals due Ortigas.
*   **Sublease with Allegro:** Allegro offered Liga a sublease. They entered into a "Rental Information" agreement with Liga agreeing to pay P40,000 monthly from 1 September 2001 and back rentals due Ortigas from January-August 2001. Liga paid initial advance and deposit.
*   **Ejectment:** Liga failed to pay rentals. Allegro filed an ejectment suit in MeTC.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** MeTC ruled for Allegro. RTC affirmed but modified the ruling by extending the lease for two years and reducing the rental rate. CA reversed the RTC and ruled in favor of Allegro.

**Issues on Appeal (Liga's Arguments):**

1.  Error in ordering Liga to pay back rentals to Ortigas (who was not a party to the case).
2.  Error in ordering Liga to pay P40,000 monthly rental to Allegro, alleging estoppel due to Allegro's Motion to Release Cash Bond.
3.  Error in awarding attorney's fees and costs of suit, arguing willingness to pay appropriate rentals.

**Court's Holding:**

1.  **Payment to Ortigas:** The Court upheld Liga's argument, stating that the CA erred in ordering payment to Ortigas. Ortigas was not a party, and a judgment cannot bind non-parties. Allegro did not plead a claim as Ortigas's legal representative, violating the principle of *secundum allegata et probata*.

    *   **Relevant Case Law:** *St. Dominic Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court*, *Falcon v. Manzano*, *Lerma v. De la Cruz*.
2.  **Monthly Rental to Allegro:** The Court rejected Liga's argument. The rental agreement between Liga and Allegro was binding as a contract (*Art. 1159, Civil Code*). Allegro's motion to release cash bond did not create estoppel.

    *   **Relevant Case Law:** *Almeda v. Court of Appeals*, *Metro Manila Development Authority v. Jancom Environmental Corporation*, *Kalalo v. Luz*, *Sps. Catungal v. Jao*
3.  **Attorney's Fees and Costs of Suit:** The Court affirmed the award, citing Liga's bad faith in refusing to pay a valid claim (*Art. 2208, Civil Code*).

    *   **Relevant Case Law:** *Barzaga v. Court of Appeals*
4.  **Interest:** The Court awarded Allegro 12% interest per annum on the back rentals from the date of extrajudicial demand (15 December 2001).

    *   **Relevant Case Law:** *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Liga is obligated to pay Allegro back rentals at P40,000/month from 1 September 2001 until she vacates the premises, plus 12% interest per annum from 15 December 2001.
*   Liga is liable for attorney's fees and costs of suit.
*   Allegro is not entitled to collect back rentals on behalf of Ortigas for the period of 1 January 2001 to 31 August 2001.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Continued Possession:** The judgment does not explicitly define the "time [Liga] vacates the subject premises." This leaves room for dispute regarding when the rental obligation ceases.
*   **Deduction for Payments:** The CA decision mentions that the "amounts already paid by the respondent, as cited by the MeTC and the RTC and borne by the records of this case, should be deducted from whatever obligations respondent still has with petitioner Allegro." The exact amount of these prior payments needs to be clearly established to avoid future disputes.
