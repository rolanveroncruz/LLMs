## Legal Document Summary: People v. Baun, G.R. No. 167503

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Luisito Baun y Mercado* (G.R. No. 167503, August 20, 2008)

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming with modification the Court of Appeals' decision, finding Luisito Baun guilty of four counts of qualified rape.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Crimes Charged:** Four counts of qualified rape under Art. 266-A in relation to Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353), committed against his daughter. The information includes the aggravating circumstance of moral ascendancy due to the father-daughter relationship. Each information specified the dates of the offenses.
*   **Defendant's Actions:** Initially pleaded not guilty, then withdrew and pleaded guilty to all four counts. Despite the guilty pleas, the trial court proceeded with trial.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution presented the victim's testimony, sworn statement, medical certificate indicating old and recent hymenal lacerations, and birth certificate.
*   **Original Sentence (RTC):** Death penalty for each count of rape, plus actual and moral damages.
*   **Appealed Sentence (CA):** Affirmed the RTC decision but added exemplary damages.
*   **Final Sentence (SC):** Affirmed guilt, modified penalty.  Death penalty reduced to *reclusion perpetua* for each count due to RA 9346 (prohibition of death penalty), without eligibility for parole.  Affirmed civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages as awarded by the Court of Appeals.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Guilty of four counts of rape. Sentence to be *reclusion perpetua* for each case without parole.
*   **Civil Liability:** Liable for damages:
    *   Moral Damages: P50,000 per count.
    *   Civil Indemnity: P75,000 per count.
    *   Exemplary Damages: P25,000 per count.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Improvident Plea of Guilty:** While the accused initially pleaded guilty, the Supreme Court acknowledged the trial court's failure to strictly observe the *People v. Aguilar* guidelines for a "searching inquiry" into the voluntariness and comprehension of a guilty plea, particularly in capital offenses.  This is a crucial issue, as an improvident plea is a basis for setting aside a conviction. However, the Supreme Court sustained the conviction because it was based on *evidence* presented, not solely on the plea (citing *People v. Derilo*).
*   **Evidentiary Reliance:** The conviction hinges heavily on the victim's testimony, deemed credible despite the argument raised by the defense. The medical certificate, while supporting the testimony, is explicitly acknowledged as not indispensable. The absence of sperm cells in the vaginal smear would have been a key factor in challenging the medical evidence, had it been present.
*   **Moral Ascendancy:** The prosecution relied on the father's "moral ascendancy" as the force/intimidation element of rape. This can be challenged if the facts do not clearly establish such influence, but the Court leaned heavily on this argument.
*   **Impact of RA 9346:** The retroactive application of RA 9346, abolishing the death penalty, significantly altered the sentence. While the new sentence is *reclusion perpetua* without parole, its practical effect is still severe.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 266-A (Rape)
*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 266-B (Penalties for Rape)
*   Republic Act No. 8353 (Anti-Rape Law of 1997)
*   Republic Act No. 9346 (Prohibition of Death Penalty)
*   Rules of Court, Rule 116, Sec. 3 (Plea of Guilty to Capital Offense)
*   Civil Code, Art. 2230 (Exemplary Damages)
*   Act No. 4103 (Indeterminate Sentence Law, as amended)

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Aguilar* (G.R. No. 172868, March 14, 2008): Guidelines for conducting a searching inquiry.
*   *People v. Derilo* (G.R. No. 117818, April 18, 1997): Conviction upheld based on evidence despite potential improvident plea.
*   *People v. Francisco* (G.R. Nos. 134566-67, January 22, 2001): Moral ascendancy in incestuous rape.
*   *People v. Mateo* (G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 7, 2004) Intermediate review by Court of Appeals.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "searching inquiry" into the guilty plea's voluntariness was arguably insufficient, providing a potential avenue for future challenges, albeit unlikely to succeed given the evidence presented.
*   The reliance on "moral ascendancy" as the equivalent of force/intimidation can be a point of contention, requiring a careful examination of the relationship's dynamics.

**Overall Assessment:** The conviction is strongly supported by the victim's testimony and corroborating medical evidence, despite the procedural concerns regarding the guilty plea. The reduction of the penalty due to RA 9346 is the main point of impact. Any potential challenges would likely focus on the inadequacy of the "searching inquiry" or the strength of the "moral ascendancy" argument.
