**Legal Document Summary: *People of the Philippines vs. Efren Custodio y Esteban***

**Case:** G.R. No. 176062

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for three counts of simple rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   Accused-Appellant was found guilty by the RTC and CA of three counts of simple rape (Art. 266-A of the Revised Penal Code) for incidents occurring on November 5-7, 1999.
*   The Informations charged the accused with having carnal knowledge of AAA "against her will and consent."
*   The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision with modifications, specifically adding exemplary damages.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-Appellant is obligated to serve the sentence of *Reclusion Perpetua* for each count of rape.
*   Accused-Appellant is obligated to pay civil indemnity of P50,000 and moral damages of P50,000 for each count of rape.
*   Accused-Appellant is ordered to pay exemplary damages of P25,000 for each count of rape.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for rape.
*   Civil liability for damages arising from the rape.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defective Informations:** The appellant argued that the informations were defective for failing to allege that he employed force and intimidation.
    *   The Supreme Court cited *People v. Galido* to rule that the defect was cured by failure to object pre-arraignment, the complaint's allegation of "force and intimidation", and unobjected evidence proving force and intimidation.
    *   The Court noted the informations charged "against her will and consent," not the legally required "through force, threat or intimidation." The CA and SC did not find this fatal given the circumstances. *People v. Oso* (62 Phil. 297) was cited as a case where such pleading deficiency proved problematic; but the infirmity was cured by competent proof.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 266-A:** Rape
*   **Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 117, Section 9** (formerly Section 8): Motion to Quash
*   **Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 116, Section 9** (formerly Section 10): Bill of Particulars
*   **People v. Galido, G.R. Nos. 148689-92:** Curing defects in information.
*   **People v. Oso, 62 Phil. 297:** Information defective when not alleging the necessary elements of rape.
*   **People v. Mendez, 390 Phil. 449, 459 (2000):** Complaint alleged means of force.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The core argument centered on the initial defects in the Information, and whether it sufficiently described the crime of rape under Art. 266-A, considering the allegations used were only "against her will and consent" and not "through force, threat or intimidation." While the conviction was upheld, the emphasis on the need for more precise language in charging rape is notable.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction and modified the award of damages, affirming the appellant's guilt and associated liabilities. The case highlights the importance of proper pleading in criminal informations and the curing of such defects by subsequent actions or the admission of relevant evidence.
