**Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Stock Exchange, Inc. vs. The Manila Banking Corporation***

**Case:** G.R. No. 147778, July 23, 2008

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding SEC's jurisdiction over a Petition for Mandamus with Claim for Damages.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Philippine Stock Exchange, Inc. (PSEI) and its Board of Governors
*   **Respondent:** The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC)

**Background:**

*   TMBC acquired Manila Stock Exchange (MSE) Seat No. 97 (registered to Roberto K. Recio) via execution sale.
*   PSEI incorporated, unifying MSE and Makati Stock Exchange.
*   TMBC claims MSE Seat No. 97 became PSE Seat No. 29, seeks PSEI recognition of its ownership.
*   PSEI refused recognition, leading TMBC to file Petition for Mandamus with Claim for Damages at the SEC SICD.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** Whether the SEC had jurisdiction over the case.
*   **Cause of Action:** Whether TMBC's petition stated a cause of action against PSEI.
*   **Propriety of Mandamus:** Whether mandamus was the proper remedy to compel PSEI to recognize TMBC's ownership.
*   **Securities Regulation Code (RA 8799):** The impact of RA 8799, enacted during the proceedings, which transferred jurisdiction over cases under PD 902-A Section 5 to Regional Trial Courts (RTCs).

**Holdings:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which upheld the SEC's denial of PSEI's motion to dismiss.
*   The SC found that the SEC's SICD Hearing Panel did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion to dismiss.
*   The petition sufficiently stated a cause of action based on "devices and schemes amounting to fraud" under PD 902-A, Section 5(a). The SC agreed that the allegations of facts and misrepresentations were enough to infer a claim for relief.
*   Mandamus was deemed appropriate because PSEI's refusal to acknowledge TMBC's rights was considered grossly unjust and tyrannical, justifying the extraordinary writ.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree (PD) 902-A, Section 5(a):**  Governs the SEC's jurisdiction over cases involving devices and schemes amounting to fraud or misrepresentation.
*   **Republic Act (RA) 8799 (Securities Regulation Code):** Transferred jurisdiction of SEC over cases enumerated under Section 5 of Presidential Decree No. 902-A to the Courts of general jurisdiction or the appropriate Regional Trial Court
*   **SEC Revised Rules of Procedure, Section 6:** Details complaint requirements
*   **Rule XVI, Section 1:** States that only final decisions or rulings shall be subjected to appeal to the Commission en banc.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Potential Risks:**

*   The determination of what constitutes "devices and schemes amounting to fraud" under PD 902-A, Section 5(a) is fact-specific. The SEC's reliance on the allegations in the petition without a full trial could be considered prejudicial.
*   The application of mandamus is contentious, as it is typically not available where an official act involves discretion. The SC's finding of "gross abuse of discretion" could broaden the scope of mandamus.
*   The ownership of the seat is still subject to the requirements of being an individual or corporation primarily engaged in the business of stocks and bonds brokers and dealers in securities to be a member or to hold a seat.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **PSEI:** Must address TMBC's claims regarding ownership of PSE Seat No. 29.

**Outcome:**

*   Petition DENIED. The case proceeds to trial.
