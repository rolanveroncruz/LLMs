## Legal Document Summary: *De la Torre v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 102786)

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Alejandro B. de la Torre for qualified theft. The Supreme Court ultimately reversed the lower courts' decisions and acquitted De la Torre due to reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Qualified Theft under Arts. 309 & 310 of the Revised Penal Code, for allegedly stealing six electric meters from Cathay Pacific Steel and Smelting Corporation (CAPASSCO) while employed as a leadman for MERALCO.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution's case rested primarily on the eyewitness testimony of Danilo Garcia, who claimed to have seen De la Torre supervising the removal of the meters.
*   **RTC Decision:** Convicted De la Torre based on Garcia's testimony.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC's decision.

**Key Legal Issues & Arguments:**

*   **Violation of Constitutional Rights (Art. III, §12(1) & (3) of the Constitution):** De la Torre argued his rights were violated during custodial investigation due to lack of counsel and failure to be informed of his right to remain silent. The Court ruled a police line-up isn't part of custodial investigation. *Gamboa v. Cruz, 162 SCRA 642 (1988)* was cited regarding custodial investigation procedures.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** De la Torre argued the testimonies of prosecution witnesses were inadmissible because they weren't formally offered as required by Rule 132, §35 of the Rules of Court. The Court held that failure to object at trial constitutes a waiver of this objection. *People v. Java, 227 SCRA 668 (1993)* was cited regarding the requirement of formally offering evidence.
*   **Hearsay Evidence:** De la Torre argued the RTC improperly considered written statements (certifications) without presenting the declarants for cross-examination, violating the hearsay rule. The Court agreed, stating such evidence has no probative value even if admitted without objection. *People v. Valero, 112 SCRA 661 (1982)* was cited regarding the probative value of hearsay evidence.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The Court found the prosecution's evidence insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, primarily due to the uncorroborated and improbable testimony of Danilo Garcia. *People v. Ibal, 143 SCRA 317 (1986)* was cited on inconsistencies in testimony.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Initially, De la Torre was ordered to indemnify MERALCO in the amount of P41,786.00. However, this obligation was extinguished upon acquittal.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The case highlights the risk of relying solely on the testimony of a single eyewitness, especially when the testimony contains inconsistencies or lacks credibility.
*   Ambiguity could arise in applying the rules regarding formal offering of evidence. This case clarifies that objections must be timely made to preserve them for appeal.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Arts. 309 & 310 (Qualified Theft)
*   Rules of Court, Rule 132, §§1, 35
*   Constitution, Art. III, §12(1) & (3)

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Gamboa v. Cruz, 162 SCRA 642 (1988)*
*   *People v. Java, 227 SCRA 668 (1993)*
*   *People v. Valero, 112 SCRA 661 (1982)*
*   *People v. Ibal, 143 SCRA 317 (1986)*

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed De la Torre's conviction, finding the prosecution's evidence insufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court emphasized the importance of corroborating evidence and scrutinizing the credibility of witnesses. This case also serves as a reminder of the inadmissibility of hearsay evidence and the necessity of timely objections during trial.
