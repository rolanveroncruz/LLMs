Okay, here's a summary of the provided legal document in markdown format, focusing on key points for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Municipality of Parañaque vs. V.M. Realty Corporation* (G.R. No. 127820, July 20, 1998)

**Summary:**

This case involves the Municipality of Parañaque's attempt to expropriate land owned by V.M. Realty Corporation for a socialized housing project. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision, which in turn affirmed the Regional Trial Court's dismissal of the expropriation suit.  The key issues were: (1) whether a resolution is sufficient to authorize expropriation under RA 7160, and (2) whether *res judicata* bars the current suit.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 19 of RA 7160 (Local Government Code):** This is the central statutory reference. It explicitly requires an *ordinance*, not merely a resolution, for an LGU to exercise the power of eminent domain. This is a key *sine qua non* of the LGU's power to exercise eminent domain.

*   **Essential Requisites for LGU Expropriation (derived from Sec. 19 of RA 7160):**
    1.  Ordinance authorizing expropriation.
    2.  Public use, purpose, or welfare (benefit of poor/landless).
    3.  Payment of just compensation.
    4.  Valid and definite offer to owner (prior to suit), which was not accepted.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Proper Authorization:** The Municipality’s reliance on a resolution (Sangguniang Bayan Resolution No. 93-95) instead of an ordinance is fatal to its claim. The Court emphasizes the clear and unambiguous language of RA 7160, which *requires* an ordinance.
*   **Defective Complaint:** The complaint itself states no cause of action because it is predicated on a resolution, not an ordinance.
*   **Res Judicata:** While the Court acknowledges the presence of the elements of *res judicata* due to a prior dismissed expropriation case (Civil Case No. 17939), it qualifies its application. *Res judicata* will not absolutely bar a subsequent expropriation if the legal requirements are now met. However, the ruling in Civil Case No. 17939 will apply to specific issues decided in a previous case.
*   **Risk of Strict Construction:** The Court emphasizes that eminent domain is a derogation of private property rights and thus must be strictly construed.  Any ambiguity will be interpreted against the LGU seeking to exercise the power.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7160, Section 19:** The definitive statutory basis for LGU expropriation and the requirement of an ordinance.
*   **BP 337 (Previous Local Government Code):** Distinguishes this from the current law (RA 7160). BP 337 allowed for a resolution, which is no longer sufficient.
*   **Camarines Sur vs. Court of Appeals, 222 SCRA 173:** Distinguishes, as it applies to the now repealed BP 337.
*   **Republic vs De Knecht, 182 SCRA 142:** Illustrates how *res judicata* will not apply to deny the State from exercising its eminent domain in the right conditions.
*   **Article 36, Rule VI of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code:** Notes the conflict with the law itself (RA 7160), which prevails.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Effect of Subsequent Ordinance:** The petitioner alleged the passage of a subsequent ordinance ratifying the actions, but failed to provide a certified copy. The court considered that the subsequent ordinance could not cure the inherent defect of the Complaint for expropriation filed on September 23, 1993.
*   **Scope of *Res Judicata* Exception:**  The extent to which *res judicata* applies to specific issues, as opposed to barring the entire subsequent expropriation proceeding, needs to be carefully analyzed. The Court's language suggests issue preclusion rather than claim preclusion.

**Conclusion:**

The Municipality of Parañaque's expropriation attempt failed because it was based on a resolution, not an ordinance, as required by RA 7160. While *res judicata* exists due to a prior dismissed case, it does not permanently bar a properly authorized expropriation in the future. The municipality must enact a valid ordinance and comply with all other legal requirements before reinstituting expropriation proceedings.
