## Legal Document Summary: Evasco v. Montañez

**Case:** *Hon. Leoncio Evasco, Jr. v. Alex P. Montañez*, G.R. No. 199172, February 21, 2018 (826 Phil. 449)

**Subject Matter:** Validity of Davao City Ordinance No. 092-2000 regulating outdoor advertising.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and upheld the validity of Sections 7, 8, 37, and 45 of Davao City Ordinance No. 092-2000.

**Key Provisions of Ordinance No. 092-2000 at issue:**

*   **Section 7:** Billboard location restrictions in residential zones and setback requirements (minimum 10 meters from property lines abutting the road right-of-way; 150 meter unobstructed line of sight).
*   **Section 8:** Designation of "regulated areas" (bridge approaches) to preserve scenic views.
*   **Section 37:** Sign permit fees (variable rates based on display surface area and type of sign).
*   **Section 45:** Removal of illegal advertising materials by the City Engineer (structures without permits, lacking permit markings, beyond expiry date, in public places or violative of the ordinance). Provides for 60 days' notice to comply before removal.

**Arguments of Respondent/Plaintiff (Montañez, DABASA):**

*   Ordinance is unconstitutional: overbroad, vague, and inconsistent with the National Building Code (PD 1096).
*   Section 7 contradicts National Building Code setback requirements.
*   Section 8's reliance on aesthetics is not a valid exercise of police power.
*   Section 37's fees are excessive and confiscatory.
*   Section 45 is an undue delegation of derivative power.

**Arguments of Petitioner/Defendant (City of Davao):**

*   Ordinance does not violate National Building Code.
*   Section 7 mirrors the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the National Building Code.
*   Section 8 is authorized by Section 458(a)(3)(iv) of the Local Government Code (RA 7160).
*   Section 37's invalidation lacked specific legal basis.
*   Section 45 is within the City Engineer's powers.

**Court's Reasoning:**

*   The power to regulate billboards was validly delegated to the local city council via Davao 's charter (RA 4354). This specific grant takes precedence over the general requirements of the National Building Code.
*   Petitioners failed to allege the specific constitutional provision violated.
*   The ordinance is a valid exercise of police power, having a lawful subject (public safety, order, aesthetics) and employing lawful methods (reasonable restrictions and permit requirements).
*   Ordinance not so excessive as to be prohibitive, arbitrary, unreasonable, oppressive, or confiscatory. The local council is in the best position to determine the needs of its constituents.
*   Stricter limitations may be imposed because its police power originates from its charter and not from the National Building Code.

**Obligations:**

*   Outdoor advertising businesses must comply with all provisions of Ordinance No. 092-2000, including setback requirements, location restrictions, permit requirements, and payment of fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   Failure to comply with Ordinance No. 092-2000 may result in the removal of advertising materials at the owner's expense.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The Court noted that the City Engineer's orders of demolition gave only 3 days to correct structure defects in violation of the 60 days stipulated under Section 45 of the Ordinance. Such orders should observe the 60 days stipulated under Section 45 of the Ordinance.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *City of Manila v. Laguio, Jr.* (495 Phil. 289 (2005)): Distinguishes circumstances.
*   *People v. Fajardo* (104 Phil. 443 (1958)): Aesthetic consideration; court said that local governments cannot rely solely on aesthetics in justifying its exercise of police power.
*   *Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. Bel-Air Village Association* (385 Phil. 586, 601-602): Discusses Congress's power to delegate powers to the local government.
*   *Social Justice Society (SJS) v. Atienza, Jr.* (568 Phil. 658, 699-700 (2008)): Requirements for an ordinance's validity.

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 1096 (National Building Code of the Philippines)
*   Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code of the Philippines)
*   Republic Act No. 4354 (Revised Charter of the City of Davao)

**Potential Contentious Clauses:**

*   The specific fee schedule in Section 37 could still be challenged as excessive or unreasonable in its application.
*   The interpretation and application of "regulated areas" under Section 8 could be subject to dispute.
