**Legal Document Summary: *Abadiano v. Martir*, G.R. No. 156310, July 31, 2008 (582 Phil. 647)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision affirming an RTC decision in an action for quieting of title and recovery of possession.

**Key Issue:** Validity of a 1922 *Compra Y Venta* (Deed of Sale) allegedly transferring ownership of a portion of registered land (Lot No. 1318) from Ramon and David Abadiano to Victor Garde, respondents' predecessor-in-interest. Petitioner, Xerxes Abadiano, claims ownership through inheritance from Ramon Abadiano and denies the validity of the *Compra Y Venta*.

**Holding:** SC reversed the CA and RTC decisions, declaring the heirs of Ramon and David Abadiano as the lawful owners of Lot No. 1318-B.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 20461:**  Issued in 1923 in the name of spouses Bañares and Villanueva.  Subject to a subsequent Agreement of Partition (1922). Reconstituted as OCT No. RO-8211 (20461), with the Agreement of Partition and a Deed of Confirmation annotated.
*   **Agreement of Partition (1922):**  Partitioned Lot No. 1318 into Lots A, B, and C, assigning Lot 1318-B to Ramon and David Abadiano.
*   ***Compra Y Venta* (Alleged Deed of Sale, 1922):**  Purportedly sold Ramon and David Abadiano's interest in Lot 1318-B to Victor Garde. This document's authenticity and due execution are the central point of contention. The court found the *Compra Y Venta* to be an unproven and unreliable document.
*   **Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-31862:** Issued in 1962 to Leopoldo Bañares, Amando Bañares, and Ramon and David Abadiano based on an *ex-parte* petition to confirm the Agreement of Partition and associated documents.
*   **Laches:** The Court found that the petitioner was not guilty of Laches because the petitioner had good reasons to believe that the property was still rightfully theirs.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondents are liable to pay petitioner and co-heirs:
    *   Rentals for actual occupation period (1976-1981) at P3,000.00/hectare/year.
    *   Moral damages: P100,000.00
    *   Exemplary damages: P30,000.00
    *   Attorney's fees: P10,000.00

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Authenticity and Due Execution of *Compra Y Venta*:**  This is the primary risk.  The SC emphasized that the RTC and CA erred by not first establishing the document's authenticity before ruling on its validity.  The Respondents only presented a photocopy of the *Compra Y Venta* to the lower court. Petitioner’s specific denial of the sale, combined with the lack of proper authentication of the *Compra Y Venta*, was a critical factor in favor of Petitioner.
*   **Notarial Inconsistencies:** The fact that the alleged *Compra Y Venta* shared the same notarial inscription with the Deed of Partition raises serious questions regarding its regularity.  SC noted this undermined the presumption of regularity normally afforded to notarial documents.
*   **Delay in Annotation:** The Respondents' failure to annotate the alleged *Compra Y Venta* on TCT No. 31862 until 1982 undermines their claim of continuous ownership and possession since 1922.
*   **Laches:** While the SC ruled against applying laches in this case, the long period between the alleged sale (1922) and the action to quiet title (1982), combined with possession by parties other than the Abadianos for part of that time, could have been a contentious point. *See Miguel v. Catalino, 26 SCRA 234 (1968)* for the general application of laches to registered land.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 130, Sections 3 & 5, Revised Rules of Court:**  Governing admissibility of documentary evidence, particularly requiring the original document except in specific circumstances.
*   **Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 47:**  Addressing indefeasibility and imprescriptibility of Torrens titles, but acknowledging the potential application of laches.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 2208:** Regarding attorneys fees.

**Case Law References:**

*   The decision cites numerous cases to support its findings, including *Bulos, Jr. v. Yasuma, G.R. No. 164159, July 17, 2007*, *Citibank, N.A. v. Sabeniano, G.R. No. 156132, October 12, 2006*, and *The Consolidated Bank and Trust Company v. Del Monte Motor Works, et al., G.R. No. 143338, July 29, 2005* regarding standards of appellate review and the requirement of specific denial under oath.
* *Pilapil, et al. v. Heirs of Briones, et al., G.R. No. 150175, March 10, 2006* Confidential relationships excuse delays to a degree.

**Ambiguities:**

*   Respondents' mistaken identification of the subject property as Lot No. 1318-C instead of Lot No. 1318-B in their complaint raises some ambiguity, although the court noted that the respondents admitted to this.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court prioritized the integrity of the Torrens system, emphasizing the need for clear and convincing evidence to challenge registered titles. The failure of the respondents to properly authenticate the *Compra Y Venta*, coupled with inconsistencies in the documentation and annotation history, proved fatal to their claim. The ruling underscores the importance of diligent record-keeping and timely assertion of rights in land ownership disputes. The court applied equitable considerations to avoid penalizing the petitioners for a delay partially explained by family dynamics.
