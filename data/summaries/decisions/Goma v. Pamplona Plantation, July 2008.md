**Case:** *Goma v. Pamplona Plantation Inc.* (G.R. No. 160905, July 4, 2008)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision and reinstated the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) ruling that Bienvenido Goma was illegally dismissed from his employment with Pamplona Plantation Inc. The SC found Goma to be a regular employee, not a project employee as alleged by the respondent.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The SC held that an employer-employee relationship existed despite the respondent's initial denial. Respondent's admission before the CA that Goma was hired (albeit as a project employee) constituted a negative pregnant, acknowledging the employment.
*   **Regular vs. Project Employee (Art. 280, Labor Code):** The SC determined Goma to be a regular employee due to his length of service (two years) and the nature of his carpentry work, which was deemed necessary or desirable in the business of the respondent (plantation management, tourist resorts, etc.). Respondent failed to prove Goma was specifically informed of a defined project scope/duration at the time of hiring.
*   **Termination Requirements for Project Employees:** The court notes that the respondent also failed to submit a termination report to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).
*   **Illegal Dismissal (Articles 282, 283, and 284 of the Labor Code):** Goma's dismissal was deemed illegal as it was not based on any just or authorized cause. The employer failed to present evidence justifying the dismissal.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Reinstatement (or Separation Pay):** Given the impracticality of reinstatement due to the length of litigation, the SC awarded separation pay in lieu of reinstatement.
*   **Backwages:** The respondent is liable for full backwages from the date of illegal dismissal until the finality of the SC decision.
*   **Salary Differential:** The NLRC's award of salary differential was affirmed.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The respondent is liable for attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the monetary award.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Determination of Actual Monetary Awards:** The specific amounts for separation pay and backwages are subject to computation by the NLRC upon remand. This could lead to further disputes regarding the calculation method and included compensable items.
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** The court referenced *Pamplona Plantation Company, Inc. v. Tinghil* and *Pamplona Plantation Company v. Acosta*, affirming the earlier rulings to pierce the veil of corporate fiction between the respondent and Pamplona Plantation Leisure Corporation (PPLC). This could have implications for the respondent's liability beyond this specific case, extending to the obligations of PPLC.
*   **Proof of Project-Based Employment:** The ruling emphasizes the employer's burden of proving project-based employment by clearly informing the employee about the project's scope and duration at the time of engagement and consistently documenting project completion, including required reports to DOLE.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 280, Labor Code:** Defines regular vs. casual employment.
*   **Arts. 282, 283, 284, Labor Code:** Specify just and authorized causes for termination.
*   **Agabon v. NLRC:** Outlines the four possible situations in illegal dismissal cases and determines proper remedies.
*   **Department Order No. 19 (and Policy Instructions No. 20):** Requires employers to submit termination reports for project employees to DOLE.
*   *Manila Electric Company v. Benamira:* Question of fact on employer-employee relationship.
*   *Pamplona Plantation Company, Inc. v. Tinghil; Pamplona Plantation Company v. Acosta:* Established alter ego relationship of the two corporation.

**Conclusion:**

The SC ruling establishes that Goma was illegally dismissed and is entitled to monetary compensation. This case highlights the importance of clear documentation and communication when hiring project employees and adhering to due process in termination procedures.
