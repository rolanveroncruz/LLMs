**Case Summary: Dela Cruz-Lanuza v. Lanuza, Jr. (G.R. No. 242362)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage based on lack of marriage license and/or psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code (Psychological Incapacity):** The core issue revolves around whether Alfredo M. Lanuza, Jr. (Alfredo) was psychologically incapacitated at the time of the marriage to Leonora O. Dela Cruz-Lanuza (Leonora). The Court emphasizes the legal concept of psychological incapacity, aligning with *Tan-Andal v. Andal* (902 Phil. 558 (2021)) defining it as a "durable or enduring aspect of a person's personality" that makes compliance with essential marital obligations impossible.
*   **Essential Marital Obligations (Articles 68-73, Family Code):** The Court considers Alfredo's obligations under Articles 68 and 220, Family Code, including the duty to live together, mutual support, fidelity, and parental duties. His repeated infidelity, abandonment, and lack of support are key evidence.
*   **Procedural Error:** The Court of Appeals dismissed the initial appeal for being the wrong remedy (Rule 42 Petition for Review instead of Rule 41 Ordinary Appeal or Rule 45 Petition for Review on Certiorari). Despite acknowledging this error, the Supreme Court opted to resolve the case on its merits, invoking the principles of justice and equity.
*   **Admissibility of Expert Testimony:** The OSG contested the expert opinion of Clinical Psychologist Noel N. Ison (Ison) due to his inability to personally examine Alfredo, citing *Suazo v. Suazo* (629 Phil. 157 (2010)). The Supreme Court, however, relied on *Georfo v. Republic* and *Tan-Andal*, reiterated that collateral information is admissible, emphasizing that a psychiatric evaluation of the alleged incapacitated spouse is not indispensable.
*   **Marriage License:** Petitioner's assertion that there was no valid marriage license. The court denies this claim due to lack of evidence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Alfredo had a legal and moral obligation to fulfill his marital duties under the Family Code. His repeated marriages to other women, abandonment, and failure to provide support constitute breaches of these obligations.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Collateral Information:** While the Court permits reliance on collateral information, the absence of a direct evaluation of Alfredo could open the decision to scrutiny regarding the accuracy and reliability of the psychologist's conclusions.
*   **Establishing Juridical Antecedence:** The decision emphasizes that the psychological incapacity must have existed at the time of the marriage. The finding that Alfredo's personality disorder developed during his childhood, and prior to the marriage, relies on Ison's assessment based on indirect information. This finding is crucial and warrants careful evaluation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code, Articles 36, 68-73, and 220:** Defines psychological incapacity and essential marital obligations.
*   ***Tan-Andal v. Andal*** **(902 Phil. 558 (2021)):** Defines the legal concept of psychological incapacity.
*   ***Georfo v. Republic***: Established the basis for expert's opinion, the psychiatric evaluation of the alleged incapacitated spouse is not indispensable.
*   ***Perez-Ferraris v. Ferraris*** **(527 Phil. 722 (2006)):** Cited by the OSG to argue that the acts attributed to Alfredo amounted to mere unwillingness to assume marital obligations rather than psychological incapacity. Distinguished by the court given the totality of evidence, including the multiple marriages and abandonment.
*   ***Suazo v. Suazo*** **(629 Phil. 157 (2010)):** Cited by OSG to question expert opinion, because persons interviewed are those interested in the declaration of nullity of marriage.
*   **Rules of Court (1997), Rules 41, 42, and 45:** Deals with the procedural aspect of the appeal.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court granted the petition, declaring the marriage void based on Alfredo's psychological incapacity. The court considered the totality of the evidence, including Alfredo's multiple marriages, abandonment, and expert testimony. The decision highlights the Court's willingness to relax procedural rules in the interest of justice. The case reinforces the *Tan-Andal* standard for psychological incapacity and underscores the importance of understanding and fulfilling essential marital obligations.
