**Summary:**

Jerry Valeroso was found guilty of illegal possession of a firearm. The prosecution presented sufficient evidence to prove both the existence of the firearm and the lack of license, relying on the arresting officer's testimony and the FED certification. The court considered and rejected Valeroso's defenses, including his claim of a valid Memorandum Receipt. The court correctly applied the amended penalty under R.A. No. 8294, as it was more favorable to the accused. There are limited grounds to contest the decision.
