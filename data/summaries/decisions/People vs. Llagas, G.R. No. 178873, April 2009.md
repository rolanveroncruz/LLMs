## Case Summary: People v. Llagas, G.R. No. 178873 (April 24, 2009)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court conviction for Rape under Art. 266-A in relation to Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353).

**Facts:** The accused, Illustre Llagas, was charged with rape. The complainant, AAA, alleged Llagas lured her to his house under false pretenses, then used violence and intimidation (boxing, strangulation, threat with a knife) to overcome her resistance and forcibly have sexual intercourse with her. The defense initially claimed consensual sex on a different date, later changing its position to consensual sex on the date in question while relying on the wife's phone call. The trial court convicted Llagas; the Court of Appeals affirmed but modified the award of moral damages.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Elements of Rape:**  The Court affirms the lower courts' finding of rape based on the complainant's credible testimony demonstrating lack of consent, violence, and intimidation.
*   **Credibility of Victim:** The Court emphasizes the victim's straightforward, candid, and spontaneous testimony and the lack of evidence showing any ill motive to testify falsely.  *Case Law: People v. Manallo, G.R. No. 143704, March 28, 2003.*
*   **Delay in Reporting:**  The Court rejects the argument that the complainant's week-long delay in reporting the rape weakens her credibility, citing her fear of the accused's threats. *Case Law: People v. Astorga, G.R. No. 110097 December 22, 1997; People v. Aleman, G.R. No. L-39776, February 20, 1981*.
*   **Change of Theory on Appeal:** The court rejected the change of theory on appeal which can be construed against his innocence.
*   **Civil Liability:**  The Court upholds the award of civil indemnity (P50,000) and moral damages (P50,000) and adds an award of exemplary damages (P25,000).
*   **Exemplary Damages:**  Although not alleged in the information, the Court awards exemplary damages based on the proven use of a deadly weapon during the commission of the crime. *Case Law: People v. Custodio, G.R. No. 176062, July 4, 2008*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant (Illustre Llagas):**  Sentenced to Reclusion Perpetua (life imprisonment). Liable to pay the complainant:
    *   P50,000 as Civil Indemnity
    *   P50,000 as Moral Damages
    *   P25,000 as Exemplary Damages

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence of Intimidation:** The ruling hinges heavily on the complainant's testimony. While the court found it credible, the degree and nature of the intimidation could be subject to scrutiny in future similar cases.
*   **Award of Exemplary Damages Absent Allegation:**  While the Court cites precedent for awarding exemplary damages based on facts proven at trial but not alleged in the information, this practice could be challenged as violating due process, specifically the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation.
*   **Appellant's Defense:** The appellant's changing testimony raises questions about credibility, however the case is heavily focused on the complainant's testimony.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 266-A (Rape)
*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 266-B (Circumstances increasing penalty for rape)
