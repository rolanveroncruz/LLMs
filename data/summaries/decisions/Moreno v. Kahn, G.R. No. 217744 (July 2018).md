**Case Summary: *Jose Z. Moreno v. Rene M. Kahn, et al.*, G.R. No. 217744, July 30, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA Decision affirming RTC's motu proprio dismissal of a Complaint for Specific Performance and Cancellation of Titles.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Jose Moreno (Jose) sued respondents, including his sister Consuelo Kahn-Haire (Consuelo) and her children (Rene, Luis, Philippe, and Claudine Kahn), regarding parcels of land (TCT Nos. 181516 & 181517).
*   Jose alleged a verbal agreement to purchase the land from respondents in 2003 for US$200,000. Partial payments were made.
*   Consuelo later sought to "cancel" the agreement, treating prior payments as rent.
*   Consuelo, Luis, Philippe, and Claudine sold their shares to Rene, consolidating ownership. Jose alleges this was without his consent and violated their previous agreement.
*   Jose initiated barangay conciliation proceedings with Rene only.  He then filed suit for specific performance, cancellation of titles, and damages when demands were ignored.

**Key Provisions & Legal Issues:**

*   **Article 151, Family Code:** Requires earnest efforts toward compromise in suits between family members.  The RTC dismissed the complaint *motu proprio* for non-compliance. The central issue is whether the RTC and CA erred in dismissing the complaint *motu proprio* for failure to comply with Article 151 of the Family Code. Also at issue is whether Article 151 applies given the presence of non-family members as defendants.
*   **Condition Precedent vs. Jurisdictional Defect:** The Supreme Court (SC) reiterates that non-compliance with Article 151 is *not* a jurisdictional defect, but a condition precedent. *Heirs of Favis, Sr. v. Gonzales*, 724 Phil. 465 (2014), is cited to emphasize that failure to allege such earnest efforts can be waived if not raised by the opposing party in a motion to dismiss or answer. Reliance on Section 1, Rule 9 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure is further emphasized.
*   **"Members of the Same Family":** The SC stresses that Article 151 applies only when the suit is *exclusively* between family members. Cites *Hiyas Savings and Loan Bank, Inc. v. Acuña*, 532 Phil. 222 (2006) to highlight the rationale for this rule.
*   **Article 150, Family Code:** Defines family relations.  Nephews/nieces (Rene, Luis, Philippe, and Claudine) are *not* considered "family" to their uncle (Jose) under this provision for the purposes of Article 151. *Expressio unius est exclusio alterius* is invoked to strictly construe Article 150.

**Obligations:**

*   Plaintiffs in suits between family members have an obligation to demonstrate earnest efforts to compromise *before* filing suit.
*   Defendants must raise non-compliance with Article 151 at the earliest opportunity (motion to dismiss or answer) to avoid waiver.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Initial Liability:** Jose initially faced dismissal of his suit for non-compliance with Article 151.
*   **Reversal:** On appeal, the Supreme Court found the lower courts had erred in dismissing *motu proprio*.
*   **Procedural Risk:**  The case is remanded to the RTC for further proceedings.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   Whether the inclusion of nephews/nieces as co-defendants automatically negates the requirement of Article 151, given that the core dispute was initially between siblings. The SC held that it did, as the nephews/nieces were co-owners of the property and were rightfully impleaded.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 151, Family Code**
*   **Article 150, Family Code**
*   **Section 1, Rule 9, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure**
*   **Heirs of Favis, Sr. v. Gonzales**, 724 Phil. 465 (2014)
*   **Hiyas Savings and Loan Bank, Inc. v. Acuña**, 532 Phil. 222 (2006)
*   **Martinez v. Martinez**, 500 Phil. 332 (2005)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA and RTC rulings, holding that the *motu proprio* dismissal was improper because non-compliance with Article 151 is a waivable condition precedent, not a jurisdictional defect. Furthermore, Article 151 is inapplicable because the suit included defendants (nephews/niece) who are not considered "family" under Article 150 of the Family Code. The case is remanded to the RTC for further proceedings. This decision clarifies the procedural requirements for invoking Article 151 and reinforces the principle that its application is limited to suits exclusively between specified family members.
