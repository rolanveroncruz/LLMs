## Legal Document Summary: People v. Golidan, Nacionales, and Ogsila

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Eduardo Golidan y Coto-ong, Francis Nacionales y Fernandez, and Teddy Ogsila y Tahil* G.R. No. 205307, January 11, 2018.

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals Decision affirming the RTC's conviction of the accused for Rape with Homicide, Murder, and Frustrated Murder.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Crimes:** The accused were charged with and convicted of:
    *   Rape with Homicide (Art. 266-A(1)(h) Revised Penal Code -AAA)
    *   Murder (Art. 248 RPC - BBB)
    *   Frustrated Murder (Art. 248 in relation to Art. 6 -CCC)
*   **Victims:** AAA, BBB, CCC (survivor with cerebral palsy).
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution's case relies heavily on the testimony of CCC, the lone survivor, who has cerebral palsy. The prosecution presented expert testimony to establish her competence as a witness. Evidence also included forensic evidence (semen, bloodstained items), and witness testimony placing the accused near the crime scene.
*   **Accused's Defense:** Alibi, denial, and challenges to CCC's competence as a witness.
*   **Conspiracy:** The courts found that the concerted actions of the accused indicated conspiracy, making each liable for the acts of the others.
*   **Rule on Examination of Child Witness:** This ruling discusses its flexibility and allowance of leading questions to the child to ascertain the truth.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Conviction:** Appellants Eduardo Golidan and Francis Nacionales were found guilty.
*   **Penalties:**
    *   **Rape with Homicide:** Reclusion Perpetua (without parole).
    *   **Murder:** Reclusion Perpetua
    *   **Frustrated Murder:** Indeterminate Sentence (10 years 1 day of *prision mayor* to 17 years 4 months of *reclusion temporal*).
    *   **Monetary Damages:** The Supreme Court modified the monetary awards, ordering the accused-appellants to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, and temperate damages, varying in amounts per crime, to the respective victims and heirs.
    *   **Interest:** 6% per annum interest on all damages awarded from the date of finality of the Decision.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **CCC's Competency:** The central challenge to the conviction is CCC's competence to testify, given her cerebral palsy and initial non-identification of the accused. The court relied on expert testimony and the trial court's observation of the witness, but this remains a point of vulnerability. Defense attorneys challenged if her rights were adhered to under Revised Rules of Court.
*   **Identification Procedures:** Issues surrounding the various line-ups and photo arrays used for CCC's identification of the accused. Whether it was presented to her in a way that would suggest or lead her to choose them.
*   **Hearsay Evidence:** The case touches upon the admissibility of CCC's out-of-court statements and potential hearsay issues, especially given her communication challenges.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 248 RPC:** Murder.
*   **Art. 266-A(1)(h) Revised Penal Code:** Rape with Homicide.
*   **Rule 130, Sections 20 and 21:** Competency of witnesses.
*   **Rule on Examination of a Child Witness (A.M. No. 004-07-SC):** Governs examination of child witnesses, promoting a child-friendly environment and flexible questioning.
*   **People v. Jugueta, G.R. No. 202124, April 5, 2016:** Guidelines for monetary awards in criminal cases.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The exact details of the initial police investigation and the influence of third parties on CCC's identification process.
*   The extent to which CCC's cerebral palsy affected her memory and ability to accurately recount the events.
