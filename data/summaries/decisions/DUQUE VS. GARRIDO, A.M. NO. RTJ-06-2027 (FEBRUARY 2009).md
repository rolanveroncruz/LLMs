## Legal Document Summary: Duque v. Judge Garrido (A.M. No. RTJ-06-2027)

**Case Summary:** This is an administrative case against Judge Crisostomo L. Garrido for (1) undue delay in rendering a decision in Criminal Case No. 2000-10-580, violating Section 15, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution and Canon 3, Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct; and (2) violating the franking privilege under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 26.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 15(1), Article VIII, 1987 Constitution:** Mandates lower court judges to decide cases within 90 days from submission.
*   **Canon 3, Rule 3.05, Code of Judicial Conduct:** Requires judges to dispose of court business promptly and decide cases within the required periods.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 28 (July 3, 1989):** The 90-day period begins upon submission of the case without memoranda, or upon filing the last memorandum, whichever is earlier.
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 26:** Limits franking privilege to official judicial communications.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Gross Inefficiency (Undue Delay):** Found guilty.  Penalty: Fine of Php 10,000.00. Cited Sec. 9(1), Rule 140, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC, of the Revised Rules of Court.  Mitigating circumstance: first offense.
*   **Violation of P.D. No. 26 (Franking Privilege):** Found guilty. Penalty: Admonishment. Stern warning issued for future violations.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Determination of Submission Date:** The key dispute was when the 90-day period commenced. The Judge argued it started when he *declared* the case submitted for resolution, not when the last memorandum was filed. The Court rejected this, citing Administrative Circular No. 28 and case law establishing that non-submission of memoranda does not justify delay.
*   **Notification of Promulgation:**  While the Judge argued the offended party (complainant) and handling prosecutor did not need notification for the promulgation, the affidavit of the handling prosecutor, Visbal, claimed he was never informed. However, this was not a basis for any penalty imposed.
*   **Franking Privilege Abuse:**  The Judge used official postage for his Rejoinder in the administrative case, which is an abuse of the privilege.
*   **Future Liability:** Stern warning implies that any future, similar violations will result in significantly harsher penalties.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **OCA v. Judge Lourdes M. Garcia-Blanco and Atty. Lolita R. Mercado, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1941, April 25, 2006, 488 SCRA 109:** Cited regarding the mandatory nature of the 90-day period.
*   **Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the Regional Trial Court, Branch 55, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental, A.M. No. 05-4-213-RTC, March 6, 2006, 484 SCRA 99:**  Cited regarding the obligation to decide cases even without memoranda.
*   **Marites O. Tam v.Judge Jocelyn G. Regencia, MCTC, Asturias-Balamban, Cebu, A.M. No. MTJ-05-1604, June 27, 2006, 493 SCRA 26:** Cited regarding gross inefficiency.

**Analysis:**

The Court clearly emphasized the importance of timely disposition of cases.  The key issue was the interpretation of when the 90-day period began.  The Judge's reliance on his own order declaring the case submitted was rejected in favor of the rule that submission occurs upon filing (or expiration of the period to file) the last memorandum. While the fine was relatively low, the stern warning highlights the potential for significantly increased penalties for future delays. The franking privilege abuse, though only resulting in an admonishment, indicates a lack of diligence and adherence to procedural rules.
