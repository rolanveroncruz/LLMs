**Case Summary: Cruz v. Mijares, G.R. No. 154464, September 11, 2008**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus under Rule 65 challenging the RTC's denial of a law student, Ferdinand Cruz (Petitioner), to appear *pro se* in a civil case and the RTC Judge's refusal to inhibit herself.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Appearance of Non-Lawyers (Sec. 34, Rule 138 vs. Rule 138-A):** The core issue is whether the RTC erred in denying Cruz's appearance, arguing he didn't comply with Rule 138-A (Law Student Practice Rule), when Cruz based his claim on Sec. 34, Rule 138, which allows a party to conduct litigation personally.
    *   **Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) ruled in favor of Cruz, holding that Sec. 34, Rule 138 grants a party the right to represent themselves in court. The RTC erred in applying Rule 138-A, which is for law students practicing under supervision, not for a party representing themselves. The court also clarified that Rule 138-A does not supersede Rule 138.
    *   **Case Law:** Cites *Santos v. Lacurom, A.M. No. RTJ-04-1823, August 28, 2006, 499 SCRA 639, 648-649.* and *Maderada v. Mediodea, 459 Phil. 701, 716-717 (2003).*
*   **Judicial Inhibition:** Cruz also argued that the RTC Judge should have voluntarily inhibited herself due to bias, stemming from a comment made during pre-trial.
    *   **Holding:** The SC dismissed this claim, finding no grave abuse of discretion. The SC referenced its prior dismissal of an administrative case filed by Cruz against the judge based on the same incident.
    *   **Obligations & Liabilities:**  A judge's decision on whether to inhibit is discretionary but should be based on a rational assessment of the case circumstances.
    *   **Case Law:** Cites *People v. Ong, G.R. Nos. 162130-39, May 5, 2006, 489 SCRA 679, 688.* and *Abrajano v. Heirs of Augusto F. Salas, Jr., G.R. No. 158895, February 16, 2006, 482 SCRA 476, 487.*

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Petitioner's Lack of Legal Expertise:** The SC acknowledged that Cruz, as a non-lawyer, faces the "snares and hazards of his own ignorance" of legal procedure and evidence. This presents a significant risk to his case.
*   **Implication on Pro Se Litigants:** This case reinforces the right to self-representation, but it also highlights the potential disadvantages for litigants without legal training. While the court acknowledges the right, it implicitly cautions against it without emphasizing legal aid alternatives.

**Outcome:** The SC *partially granted* the petition, directing the RTC to admit Cruz's appearance as a *pro se* litigant, but upheld the RTC judge's decision not to inhibit herself.
