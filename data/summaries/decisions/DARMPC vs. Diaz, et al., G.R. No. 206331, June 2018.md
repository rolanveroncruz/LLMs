Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Department of Agrarian Reform Multi-Purpose Cooperative (DARMPC) v. Carmencita Diaz, et al.* G.R. No. 206331 (June 04, 2018).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied DARMPC's Petition for Review on Certiorari, upholding the Court of Appeals' decision finding illegal dismissal of the respondents (Diaz, Cabigting, and Samaniego).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The core issue is whether the employees (Respondents) were illegally dismissed. The CA found that DARMPC failed to prove *just cause* for dismissal and did not comply with *due process* requirements.
*   **Just Cause:** The CA rejected DARMPC's claim that the employees were involved in the misappropriation of funds by other employees. The Court emphasized the requirement of intentional participation in the act with a view to the furtherance of the common design and purpose.
*   **Due Process:** DARMPC failed to comply with the twin-notice and hearing requirements. Specifically, the CA found that after their preventive suspension, the employees were simply informed of their termination via Board Resolution No. 62.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** The Petition for Review was filed out of time. DARMPC's counsel misrepresented the date of receipt of the CA Resolution denying their Motion for Reconsideration. The actual receipt date was September 20, 2012, while the petition was filed on April 5, 2013.
*   **Consequences of Illegal Dismissal:** The CA awarded backwages, separation pay, and attorney's fees, citing Article 279 of the Labor Code, and Article 2208 of the Civil Code due to the illegal dismissal.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Article 279 (Rights of employees illegally dismissed), Article 282 (Grounds for Termination, just cause), paragraphs (a) and (c)
*   **Civil Code:** Article 2208 (Attorney's fees), awarding 10%
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 45 (Petition for Review on Certiorari), Rule 39 (Execution of Judgments), Section 1
*   **Magsino v. De Ocampo**, 741 Phil. 394 (2014) (liberal construction of rules)
*   **Asuncion v. NLRC**, 340 Phil. 36 (1997) (finality of judgments)

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Monetary Liability:** DARMPC faces significant monetary liability including backwages, separation pay, 13th month pay, unpaid leaves, and attorney's fees. The case is remanded to the Labor Arbiter for computation. DARMPC’s claim that this will cause bankruptcy is noted but not addressed as it does not affect the court's determination.
*   **Damage to Reputation:** Finding of illegal dismissal could negatively impact DARMPC's reputation.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Court did not explicitly mention the definition of the monetary equivalent of other benefits, instead remanding the case to the arbiter branch.
*   Atty. Tamaca's claim of misplacing the copy of the Court of Appeals September 12, 2012 Resolution.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision based on DARMPC's failure to prove just cause and observe due process in the dismissal of Diaz, Cabigting, and Samaniego. Crucially, the petition was dismissed due to the untimely filing, a misrepresentation of dates by the DARMPC’s counsel, and counsel's negligence is binding on the Cooperative.
