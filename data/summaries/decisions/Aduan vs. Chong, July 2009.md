**Case Summary: *Sps. Artemio and Esperanza Aduan vs. Levi Chong*, G.R. No. 172796, July 13, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing Department of Justice (DOJ) resolutions that discharged Esperanza Aduan from an Information for falsification of a public document.

**Facts:**

*   Levi Chong's wife, Nelia, issued a postdated check and executed a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage in favor of the Aduans to secure a loan. Chong later alleged coercion and forgery of his signature on the deed.
*   The check was dishonored, leading the Aduans to file BP 22 and Estafa charges against Nelia and Levi Chong.
*   The Chongs filed a forgery complaint against Esperanza Aduan and Ernesto Sagum, alleging Esperanza induced Sagum to forge Levi Chong's signature on the mortgage deed.
*   The Manila City Prosecutor found probable cause against Sagum and Esperanza for falsification of public document, filing an Information against them.
*   The DOJ reversed the City Prosecutor's resolution regarding Esperanza, ordering her discharge, based on Sagum's admission that he forged the signature without Esperanza's assistance and the absence of clear evidence of conspiracy.
*   The CA reversed the DOJ, reinstating the Information against both Sagum and Esperanza, reasoning that there was a strong indication of conspiracy.
*   The MeTC dropped Esperanza from the Information based on the DOJ resolution, pending appeal in the CA.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Falsification of Public Document:** The central issue is whether there is probable cause to indict Esperanza for falsification of a public document under the Revised Penal Code.  Specifically, did she conspire with Sagum?
*   **Probable Cause Determination:** The case hinges on the standard of "grave abuse of discretion" when reviewing the DOJ's determination of probable cause.
*   **Conspiracy:**  The CA found a "strong indication" of conspiracy based on Esperanza's potential benefit as mortgagee. The DOJ found no evidence of conspiracy. *Dans, Jr. v. People* (G.R. No. 127073, January 29, 1998, 285 SCRA 504) is cited by the court to emphasize the need for competent proof, independently and beyond reasonable doubt, for conspiracy.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Did the DOJ commit grave abuse of discretion in reversing the City Prosecutor's finding of probable cause? Cites *People v. Terrado, G.R. No. 148226, July 14, 2008* for definition of "grave abuse of discretion"
*   **Mootness:** Petitioners argued the CA case was moot as the MeTC dropped Esperanza from the Information based on the DOJ ruling. The Court ruled that with the grant of the writ of certiorari prayed for by the spouses Chong, the DOJ Resolution has been declared null and void, hence, all actions emanating from such Resolution are also null and void.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and reinstated the DOJ resolutions discharging Esperanza Aduan.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Deference to DOJ:** Courts should defer to the DOJ's determination of probable cause unless there is a clear case of grave abuse of discretion. (Cited *First Women's Credit Corporation v. Perez*, G.R. No. 169026, June 15, 2006, 490 SCRA 774, 777 and *UCPB v. Looyuko*, G.R. No. 156337, September 28, 2007, 534 SCRA 322, 331)
*   **Lack of Evidence of Conspiracy:** The DOJ's finding of no conspiracy was not a grave abuse of discretion. The mere fact that Esperanza stood to benefit from the mortgage did not establish conspiracy.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Erroneous Prosecution:** The CA decision, if upheld, would have subjected Esperanza to prosecution without sufficient evidence of conspiracy.
*   **Civil Suit:** The forged deed could create liabilities related to property ownership and mortgage rights. The outcome of the pending foreclosure action may be affected.
*   **Reversal on other issues:** the reversal of the decision does not insulate other issues from being raised such as the coercion of Levi Chongs wife, Nelia when signing the deed, etc.
