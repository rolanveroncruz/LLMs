## Legal Document Summary - Davao Oriental Electric Cooperative, Inc. vs. The Province of Davao Oriental

**Case:** G.R. No. 170901, January 20, 2009 (596 Phil. 705)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Davao Oriental Electric Cooperative, Inc. (DORECO)
*   **Respondent:** The Province of Davao Oriental

**Subject Matter:** Real Property Tax (RPT) delinquency collection for years 1984-1989.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

1.  **Tax Exemption Claim:** DORECO claimed tax exemption under PD 269, initially withdrawn by PD 1955 and subsequently "restored" by FIRB Resolution No. 24-87 effective July 1, 1987. DORECO argued that the restoration was retroactive, covering the entire period of alleged delinquency.

    *   **Court Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) ruling that FIRB Resolution No. 24-87 was **not retroactive**. The language of the resolution clearly stated a restoration effective July 1, 1987.
    *   **Relevance:** This directly impacts DORECO's liability for RPT prior to July 1, 1987. The SC applied the principle of strict interpretation against tax exemptions and the principle that statutes operate prospectively unless a contrary legislative intent is made manifest.

2.  **Validity of Assessment:** DORECO contested the assessment of its properties, arguing a lack of prior consultation and erroneous classification of certain assets (poles, towers, etc.) as real property.

    *   **Court Holding:** The SC ruled against DORECO, citing its failure to exhaust administrative remedies by failing to file a protest with the Board of Assessment Appeals (BAA) within the statutory period (Section 30 of PD 464). Failure to exhaust administrative remedies renders the assessment final and unappealable.
    *   **Relevance:** This means the assessed value of properties is final, and DORECO cannot now challenge the classification of its assets as real property.

**Obligations:**

*   DORECO is obligated to pay delinquent real property taxes from January 1, 1985, to December 31, 1989, plus penalties and surcharges, *except* for the period from July 1, 1987 (if it meets conditions stipulated in the FIRB resolution)

**Liabilities:**

*   DORECO is liable for the unpaid RPT for the specified period, subject to calculation of the precise amount due.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Interest and Penalties:** The accumulation of interest and penalties on the unpaid taxes could significantly increase the overall liability.
*   **Enforcement:** The Province could pursue legal remedies to enforce the judgment, potentially including seizure and sale of DORECO's assets.
*   **Misclassification of Assets (Mitigated):** While the court ruled that the tax assessment is final, there remains an underlying issue of whether certain assets such as poles and other equipment, may indeed be personal property rather than real property, in future assessments (but not in the current case).

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **PD 269:** National Electrification Administration Decree (creation of tax exemptions for electric cooperatives)
*   **PD 1955:** Withdrew tax exemptions for private business enterprises.
*   **EO 93:** Withdrew all tax exemptions granted to private entities.
*   **FIRB Resolution No. 24-87:** Purported restoration of tax exemptions for electric cooperatives (effective July 1, 1987).
*   **PD 464:** Real Property Tax Code (Section 30 - Board of Assessment Appeals; Section 64 - Payment under protest).
*   **Maceda v. Macaraig, G.R. No. 88291, May 31, 1991:** (Regarding delegation of legislative power)
*   **Paseo Realty & Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. No. 119286, October 13, 2004:** (Doctrine of strict interpretation in tax exemption claims)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The effectivity of FIRB Resolution No. 24-87 was the main point of contention. The SC's strict interpretation against retroactivity is a crucial aspect of the decision.
*   The exact nature of FIRB Resolution No. 24-87, in that it restores tax exemptions granted by law, versus being an independent grant of tax exemption itself, may be argued.

**Conclusion:**

The SC upheld the CA's decision, rendering DORECO liable for RPT from 1985-1989, except for the period starting July 1, 1987, subject to meeting conditions set by the FIRB Resolution. DORECO's failure to exhaust administrative remedies in challenging the tax assessment was fatal to its case. Future assessments of asset classifications may be a point of contestation.
