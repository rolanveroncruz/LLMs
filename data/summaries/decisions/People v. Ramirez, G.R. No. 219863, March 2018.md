**Legal Document Summary: People v. Ramirez (G.R. No. 219863)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA Decision affirming RTC conviction for Rape and Acts of Lasciviousness.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Criminal Case No. 07-0589 (Rape - Modified to Qualified Statutory Rape):** Conviction upheld. Establishes elements of statutory rape (Art. 266-A RPC): Complainant under 12, identity of accused, and sexual intercourse. Absence of consent is presumed. Complainant was 6 years old.
*   **Criminal Case No. 07-0284 (Acts of Lasciviousness - Acquitted):** Conviction overturned. Based on hearsay evidence (statements of alleged witnesses BBB and CCC) regarding the March 18, 2007 incident, violating accused's right to confront witnesses. Hearsay evidence, even if unobjected, has no probative value without falling into an exception to the rule on hearsay.

**Liabilities:**

*   Originally, the RTC's decision ordered Ramirez to serve *reclusion perpetua* and to pay "AAA" P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75.000.00 as moral damages and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages in Criminal Case No. 07-0284 (Acts of Lasciviousness).
*   And imprisonment of six (6) months of *arresto mayor*, as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of *prision correccional*, as maximum, and to pay "AAA" P30,000.00 as civil indemnity, P30,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages in Criminal Case No. 07-0589 (Rape).
*   After the Supreme Court ruling, Ramirez will serve *reclusion perpetua* for **Qualified Statutory Rape** (Art. 266-B RPC, as victim was under 7). Civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages increased to P100,000 each. 6% legal interest per annum from finality. He is acquitted for acts of lasciviousness.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Hearsay Evidence:** Reliance on hearsay evidence (testimony of BBB and CCC), which led to acquittal in one case. The Court emphasized the importance of direct testimony and the right of the accused to cross-examine witnesses.
*   **Age Discrepancy and Penalty:** Given the victim's age (6), the original charges were insufficient. The Court *motu proprio* corrected the error, applying Art. 266-B (Qualified Statutory Rape) because of the victim's age.
*   **Fallo Discrepancy:** The Court pointed out an error in the RTC's *fallo* (dispositive portion), where the convictions were mismatched to the corresponding crimes. This highlights the need for careful review of judgments.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 266-A, Revised Penal Code (Rape):** Defines rape and its elements.
*   **Art. 266-B, Revised Penal Code (Qualified Statutory Rape):**  Addresses the specific crime and penalty when the victim is under seven years old.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346 (Death Penalty Prohibition):** Prevents imposition of the death penalty, leading to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **People v. Gaa (G.R. No. 212934, June 7, 2017):**  Cited regarding the elements of statutory rape and setting the minimum amounts of damages.
*   **People v. Mamalias (385 Phil. 499 (2000)):** Emphasizes that admission of hearsay evidence in criminal cases is a violation of constitutional rights.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The key contentious issue was the credibility of "AAA's" testimony, particularly concerning the March 18, 2007 incident, which hinged on the testimonies of "BBB" and "CCC".
*   Another point of contention was the absence of hymenal lacerations, although the court clarified that it is not essential proof of rape and the medico-legal report did not exclude sexual abuse.
