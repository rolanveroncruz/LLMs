## Legal Document Summary: Legarda vs. De Castro, PET Case No. 003

**Document:** Resolution of the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET) in *Loren B. Legarda vs. Noli L. De Castro*, PET Case No. 003, January 18, 2008.

**Nature:** Election protest filed by Loren Legarda contesting the proclamation of Noli L. de Castro as Vice-President of the Philippines following the May 10, 2004 elections.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Protest Grounds:**
    *   **First Aspect:** "Erroneous, if not manipulated, and falsified results" in final canvass documents, seeking recomputation, recanvass, and retabulation in specific precincts. Claims the source ER results were not properly transferred.
    *   **Second Aspect:** Revision of ballots in specified precincts.
*   **Pilot Provinces:** Legarda selected Lanao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, and Surigao del Sur.  She later withdrew all pilot precincts in the first aspect except those in Lanao del Sur.
*   **Dismissal of Second Aspect:**  The Second Aspect (revision of ballots) was dismissed due to Legarda's failure to make the required cash deposit, citing **Rule 33 of the 2005 PET Rules.**
*   **Findings on First Aspect:**
    *   Legarda alleged a "dagdag-bawas" scheme (vote padding/shaving) via erroneous transposition of results from election returns (ERs) to Statements of Votes by Precinct (SOV-P).
    *   She claimed Congress-retrieved ERs were fake and spurious, alleging a cover-up.
    *   The Hearing Commissioner recommended dismissal of the First Aspect.
*   **Tribunal's Ruling:**
    *   **Dismissed the First Aspect:** The PET adopted the Hearing Commissioner's recommendation, finding Legarda failed to prove her case on the First Aspect.
    *   **Presumption of Regularity:** Congress-retrieved ERs, as public documents under **Section 19(a), Rule 132 of the Rules of Court**, enjoy a presumption of regularity, which Legarda failed to rebut with clear and convincing evidence (*Melchor v. Gironella, G.R. No. 151138, February 16, 2005, 451 SCRA 476*).
    *   **Abandonment:** Legarda's election and assumption of office as Senator constituted an abandonment or withdrawal of the protest, rendering it moot, citing *Defensor-Santiago v. Ramos, P.E.T. Case No. 001, February 13, 1996, 253 SCRA 559*.  The term of the Senator coincided with the term of the Vice-President, which was the subject of the protest.
    *   **Insufficient Evidence:** Even assuming the "dagdag-bawas" occurred in the pilot municipalities, the resulting vote difference would not overcome De Castro's lead.
*   **Overall Result:**  The entire protest was dismissed.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Legarda:**  Obligated to substantiate claims of fraud with clear and convincing evidence. Failure to provide the required deposits, resulted in dismissal of a part of the case.
*   **De Castro:**  Not subject to any liability as the protest was dismissed.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The strong reliance on the presumption of regularity of public documents might be challenged if evidence of systemic fraud were compelling.
*   **Abandonment Doctrine:** The application of the abandonment doctrine based on Legarda's senatorial position could be viewed as overly technical, potentially undermining the public interest in determining the true outcome of the vice-presidential election. This is a contentious point.
*   **Evidentiary Sufficiency:** The protestant argued that limited time prevented her adducing sufficient evidence. Although the court granted her time extensions, this highlights the risk associated with such a case proceeding to judgment, especially in light of her withdrawal of several pilot provinces and the dismissal of a part of her case because she failed to make the required deposits.
* The fact that Legarda's lawyers and Noli's lawyers made statements in the press. The Tribunal reminded both parties of not trying to sensationalize the case in the media.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 33 of the 2005 PET Rules:** Effect of failure to make cash deposit.
*   **Section 19(a), Rule 132 of the Rules of Court:** Definition of public documents and their evidentiary value.
*   *Melchor v. Gironella, G.R. No. 151138, February 16, 2005, 451 SCRA 476:* Case law regarding the presumption of regularity of public documents.
*   *Defensor-Santiago v. Ramos, P.E.T. Case No. 001, February 13, 1996, 253 SCRA 559:* Case law on abandonment of an election protest.
*   **Rule 63** Dismissal; when proper.

**Conclusion:**

The resolution reflects a rigorous but ultimately unsuccessful challenge to the vice-presidential election results. The PET relied heavily on procedural rules, presumptions, and the doctrine of abandonment to dismiss the protest. Any future attempt to overturn similar election results would require demonstrating overwhelming evidence to overcome the presumption of regularity and potentially arguing against the strict application of the abandonment doctrine.
