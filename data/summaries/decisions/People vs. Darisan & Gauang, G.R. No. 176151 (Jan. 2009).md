**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Darisan and Gauang*, G.R. No. 176151 (2009)**

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Lourderico Darisan and Pilar Gauang for violations of Sections 5 and 11 of Republic Act No. 9165 (RA 9165), the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. The case stemmed from a buy-bust operation where Darisan and Gauang were caught selling and possessing *shabu* (methamphetamine hydrochloride).

**Key Provisions and Charges:**

*   **Section 5 of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs):**  The appellants were convicted of selling *shabu* to a poseur-buyer. The penalty imposed was life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00. The critical element is the actual transaction/sale and presentation of the *corpus delicti*.
*   **Section 11 of RA 9165 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs):** The appellants were also convicted of possessing *shabu*. The penalty imposed by the lower courts was modified by the Supreme Court to include both imprisonment (12 years and one day to 14 years and eight months) *and* a fine of P300,000.00, consistent with the statutory requirement. Essential elements are: (1) possession of prohibited drug, (2) unauthorized possession, and (3) conscious awareness of possession.

**Key Obligations:**

*   Appellants are obligated to serve the sentences imposed for both charges.
*   Appellants are obligated to pay the fines as specified by the Court.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs under RA 9165.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Defense of Alibi:** The appellants' alibi was rejected by the RTC, CA, and Supreme Court.  Alibi is a weak defense, especially given positive identification by the prosecution witnesses.
*   **Credibility of Police Witnesses:** The appellants challenged the credibility of the police officers involved in the buy-bust operation, alleging inconsistencies in their testimonies. The Court found the inconsistencies to be minor and immaterial. The Court relied on the presumption that police officers performed their duties regularly. *People v. Navarro* (G.R. No. 173790, 11 October 2007) provides precedent for this presumption.
*   **Chain of Custody (Implicit):**  While not explicitly stated, the prosecution needed to establish an unbroken chain of custody to ensure the integrity of the seized *shabu* as evidence. Any significant break could create reasonable doubt. The decision implies that the prosecution successfully demonstrated a proper chain of custody, given that the drug presented at trial was determined to be the same drug seized from the appellants.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Specifically, Sections 5 and 11.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Navarro, G.R. No. 173790, 11 October 2007:** Supports the presumption of regularity in the performance of duties by police officers.
*   **People of the Philippines v. Hajili and Unday, 447 Phil. 283, 295 (2003):** Outlines the elements of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **People v. Nicolas, G.R. No. 170234, 8 February 2007, 515 SCRA 187, 204:** States that Trial courts have the distinct advantage of observing the demeanor and conduct of witnesses during trial.
*   **Suson v. People, G.R. No. 152848, 12 July 2006, 494 SCRA 691, 705:** States that the defense of alibi is viewed with disfavor for it can easily be concocted and is a common defense ploy in most prosecutions for violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary "contentious" aspect revolved around the credibility of the police witnesses and the minor inconsistencies in their testimonies.  However, the Court ultimately found these inconsistencies to be immaterial and upheld their credibility. The defense of alibi was also ineffective.
