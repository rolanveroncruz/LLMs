**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Patron v. Union Bank***

**Case:** G.R. No. 177348, October 17, 2008 (590 Phil. 752)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Spouses Ramon and Luzviminda Patron (Debtors)
*   **Respondents:** Union Bank of the Philippines (UBP) (Creditor, successor to Interbank), The International Corporate Bank (Interbank) (Original Creditor), and Quedan and Rural Credit Guarantee Corporation (Quedancor) (Guarantor)

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming with modification the RTC decision in consolidated cases regarding a loan obligation.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Loan History:** Series of quedan loans obtained by Spouses Patron from Interbank from 1988, guaranteed by Quedancor. The loans were repeatedly renewed and consolidated, culminating in Promissory Note No. AGL90-0011 for P5,000,000.
*   **Promissory Note No. AGL93-0004:** The relevant promissory note, setting interest at 23% *per annum*, compounded, with a 2% *per month* penalty. This note represents a renewal of previous obligations and matured on August 9, 1993.
*   **Promissory Note No. AGL93-0022:** A promissory note that was accomplished for the renewal of the loan but the renewal application was ultimately *disapproved* by UBP following Interbank's merger.
*   **Guarantee:** Quedancor paid UBP P3,771,348.89 on September 14, 1994, pursuant to its guarantee.
*   **Demand and Lawsuits:** UBP demanded payment of the remaining balance (P2,645,889.84) from the Patrons. Patrons filed suit for cancellation of documents and declaration of nullity (Civil Case No. 22072). UBP filed a collection suit (Civil Case No. 22105). Both cases were consolidated.
*   **Interest and Penalties:** Promissory Note No. AGL93-0004 stipulated 23% interest per annum, compounded, and a 2% per month penalty for default.

**Liabilities:**

*   RTC and CA initially found the Patrons liable for the balance of the loan plus interest.
*   Supreme Court: The Patrons are liable under Promissory Note No. AGL93-0004.
    *   SC reduced the interest rate to 12% *per annum* from 23% *per annum* because it was unconscionable, citing *Trade & Investment Development Corporation v. Roblett Industrial Construction Corp.*, G.R. No. 139290, May 19, 2006, 490 SCRA 1, 7-8.
    *   SC eliminated the 2% *per month* penalty charge as unconscionable, citing *Palmares v. Court of Appeals*, 351 Phil. 664 (1998)
    *   SC sets total liability at P1,634,464.44 to bear interest of 12% per annum from the time of extrajudicial demand on September 30, 1994 until fully paid.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The Patrons are liable for attorney's fees of P163,446.44 (10% of the principal).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Unconscionable Interest:** The initial 23% interest rate and 2% monthly penalty were deemed unconscionable, highlighting the risk of such provisions being struck down by courts.
*   **Reliance on Disapproved Renewal:** The CA's initial reliance on Promissory Note No. AGL93-0022, for which the loan renewal was disapproved, demonstrates a potential risk in basing liability on documents related to unconsummated transactions.
*   **Computation of Indebtedness:** The exact computation of the principal and interest will likely be subject to further scrutiny given the numerous renewals and partial payments.
*   **Guarantor's Rights:** The decision does not explicitly address Quedancor's rights as guarantor after having made a partial payment on the guaranteed loan.
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals** *G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994, 234 SCRA 78* governs the award of interest.
