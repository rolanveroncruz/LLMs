## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-08-2103 (Formerly OCA I.P.I. No. 07-2664-RTJ)

**Case:** *Edna S.V. Ogka Benito vs. Rasad G. Balindong*

**Nature:** Administrative disciplinary case against Judge Rasad G. Balindong for gross ignorance of the law and violation of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   Complainant (Acting Mayor Benito) filed administrative/criminal complaints against municipal officials with the Ombudsman (OMB-M-A-05-175-E).
*   Ombudsman found the officials guilty and ordered their suspension, implemented by DILG-ARMM D.O. No. 2006-38.
*   Suspended officials filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition (SCA No. 12-181) in respondent Judge Balindong's RTC to annul D.O. No. 2006-38.
*   Judge Balindong issued a TRO and preliminary injunction against the DILG-ARMM implementing the suspension and ultimately annulled D.O. No. 2006-38.
*   The CA annulled Judge Balindong's decision and injunction, citing lack of jurisdiction under RA 6770 and the Rules of Procedure of the Ombudsman.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Balindong:** Obligation to know and correctly apply the law and prevailing jurisprudence. Failure constitutes gross ignorance of the law.
*   **Respondent's Defence:** Claimed good faith and lack of corrupt motives.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6770 (Ombudsman Act of 1989), Sections 14 & 27:**  Prohibits courts (except the Supreme Court on pure questions of law) from hearing appeals or applications for remedy against Ombudsman decisions.
*   **Fabian v. Desierto, G.R. No. 129742:** Established that appeals from Ombudsman administrative disciplinary decisions should be taken to the CA.
*   **Administrative Order No. 17:** Amended Section 7, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 07, specifying appeal procedures from the Ombudsman decisions.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 140, Section 8 (as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC):** Governs penalties for gross ignorance of the law.
*   **CPR Canons 1, 5, 6 & 11:** Violated by the judge, outlining obligations to uphold the law, maintain competence, and show respect for courts.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Good Faith Defense:** While good faith is a potential defense, it's not applicable where legal principles are basic and evident. The court found the law here was clear.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The core issue is the RTC's lack of jurisdiction over actions challenging Ombudsman decisions.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** The case considers both administrative liability as a judge and disciplinary proceedings as a member of the bar.

**Outcome:**

*   Judge Balindong found guilty of gross ignorance of the law.
*   Fined P30,000 for gross ignorance.
*   Fined P10,000 for violating the Lawyer's Oath and Canons of the CPR.
*   Stern warning issued.

**Overall Summary:**

This case involves administrative sanctions against a judge for exceeding his jurisdiction by entertaining a case that should have been exclusively within the purview of the Ombudsman and the Court of Appeals. The decision reiterates the fundamental duty of judges to possess a thorough knowledge of the law and to adhere to established legal principles and procedural rules. Failure to do so, even if purportedly in good faith, can result in disciplinary action, including fines and warnings, as well as repercussions for the judge's standing as a member of the bar.
