## Legal Document Summary: *Vergara v. CDM Security Agency, Inc.* (G.R. No. 225862)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking reversal of CA decision upholding NLRC's dismissal of an illegal dismissal complaint.

**Facts:** Petitioner Vergara, a security guard, filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, SSS contribution non-remittance, and money claims after being relieved of his post following an alleged gun-pointing incident with a fellow employee. He signed a Quitclaim and Release with Motion to Dismiss after receiving P11,000. Vergara later alleged non-compliance with the agreement, specifically the return of his ATM card and SSS remittance issues.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**
*   **Quitclaim and Release:** Petitioner signed a Quitclaim and Release with Motion to Dismiss before the Labor Arbiter.
*   **Respondent Obligations per Agreement:** Return of ATM card, remittance of SSS contributions and payments, refraining from filing a case against petitioner.
*   **Memo of Disciplinary Action**: Petitioner was relieved of his post and asked to report to the main office for violation of Code of Ethics and grave threat.

**Liabilities:**
*   **Labor Arbiter Decision:** Initially found illegal dismissal and ordered reinstatement with backwages, attorney's fees. Reversed by NLRC and CA.
*   **Court Decision:** Ultimately ruled in favor of the respondents, upholding the validity of the Quitclaim and Release and determining no illegal dismissal occurred.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**
*   **Validity of Quitclaim:** The central issue is whether the Quitclaim and Release is valid given Vergara's later claims of non-compliance and potential unequal bargaining power. The Court found it valid due to Vergara's acknowledgement of its implications, credible consideration, and lack of proof of coercion or fraud.
*   **ATM Card Issue:** The unresolved issue of the ATM card, while part of the preliminary agreement, did not invalidate the Quitclaim as the court considered it a separate matter. This could be argued as a breach of the settlement agreement.
*   **Lack of Due Process:** The Memorandum of Disciplinary Action was issued without a prior investigation. This could be a procedural violation of due process in employment termination, *had* the court not ruled the dismissal legal due to the quitclaim agreement.
*   **"Verbal Termination"**: The Petitioner claimed of a verbal termination which was unsubstantiated and was insufficient evidence in the court's eyes.

**Relevant Case Law:**
*   **Radio Mindanao Network Inc., v. Amurao III, 746 Phil. 60, 68 (2014):**  Cited by the Supreme Court regarding the validity of quitclaims when voluntarily made with full understanding and credible consideration. The court highlighted that a party cannot disown a release with a change of mind.
*   **Mehitabel, Inc., v. Jufhel L. Alcuizar, G.R. No. 228701-02, December 13, 2017:**  Cited by the Supreme Court on the subject of the fact of dismissal must be established by positive and overt acts of an employer.

**Statutory References:**
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:**  Governs Petitions for Review on Certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **NLRC Rules of Procedure, as amended:** Cited by the Labor Arbiter in ordering reinstatement.
*   **Social Security System (SSS) law:**  Relevant to the claim of non-remittance of SSS contributions.

**Overall Assessment:**
The Court sided with the employer, CDM Security Agency, because the employee, Vergara, signed a valid Quitclaim and Release. While there were potential procedural issues and unresolved aspects of the settlement, the court found these insufficient to invalidate the release. There is now little recourse for Vergara absent new evidence of fraud, coercion, or a fundamental flaw in the execution of the Quitclaim that wasn't addressed in the proceedings. The ruling emphasizes the importance of understanding the implications of settlement agreements before signing them.
