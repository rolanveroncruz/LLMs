**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Joseph Agalot y Rubio*, G.R. No. 220884 (2018)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision which upheld the RTC conviction of Joseph Agalot y Rubio for Rape in relation to R.A. No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act). The accused-appellant was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of raping a 12-year-old girl (AAA).

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Rape under Art. 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 8353.
*   **Elements Proven:** The prosecution successfully proved:
    *   Carnal knowledge (penetration)
    *   Accomplished through force and intimidation based on AAA's testimony of being dragged, threatened with a knife, and feeling pain during penetration.
*   **Victim's Testimony:**
    *   AAA's testimony was deemed credible, consistent, and detailed, despite the cross-examination by the defense.
    *   Her account of the incident was consistent with her sworn statement taken before the Dapitan City Police Station.
    *    Victim reported promptly to BBB, CCC, FFF and FFF's husband about the incidents and submitted to medical examination.
*   **Medical Evidence:** Dr. Mandin's medical examination of AAA within 24 hours showed erythema (redness) and abrasions on her vulva, and admission of examining finger with pain, supporting the claim of force.
*   **Defense Rejected:** The accused-appellant's defenses of denial and alibi were deemed weak and inconsistent. The alibi failed due to conflicting testimonies between the accused-appellant and his witness, Nonito Palpagan.
*   **Credibility Assessment:** The Court gave weight to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, which found the victim credible and the accused-appellant's denial unconvincing.
*   **Negative Spermatozoa Result:**  The absence of spermatozoa did not negate the rape conviction, as the presence of spermatozoa is not an element of rape.
*   **Alibi:** The accused-appellant could not prove that it was impossible to have been present in the crime scene.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant Obligation:** Serving sentence of *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole.
*   **Accused-Appellant Liability:** Pay civil indemnity of P75,000.00, moral damages of P75,000.00, and exemplary damages of P75,000.00.
*   **Interest on Damages:** All civil liabilities (civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages) shall earn interest at 6% per annum from the finality of the judgment until fully paid.

**Statutory References:**

*   R.A. No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act)
*   Art. 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 8353
*   R.A. No. 9346 (Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines)
*   R.A. No. 4180 (Indeterminate Sentence Law)

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Focus on Witness Credibility:** The case relies heavily on the victim's testimony. Any future challenge to AAA's credibility could potentially impact the conviction.
*   **Lack of Physical Evidence:** While the medical exam supported force, the absence of spermatozoa is a common point of contention in rape cases. However, the court correctly noted the absence of spermatozoa is not an element of rape.

**Case Law Used:**

The court cited numerous precedents to support the application of principles regarding witness credibility, evaluation of evidence in rape cases, and the weakness of the defense of alibi.
