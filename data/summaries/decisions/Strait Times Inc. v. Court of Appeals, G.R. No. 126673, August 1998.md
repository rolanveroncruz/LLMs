## Legal Document Summary: *Strait Times Inc. v. Court of Appeals and Regino Peñalosa*, G.R. No. 126673, August 28, 1998

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals' decision dismissing Strait Times Inc.'s (STI) petition to annul a Regional Trial Court (RTC) order directing the issuance of a new owner's duplicate certificate of title to Regino Peñalosa.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   The RTC ordered the Register of Deeds to issue a new owner's duplicate certificate of title to Peñalosa for TCT Nos. T-3767 and T-28301, declaring the allegedly lost originals null and void. *Section 109 of Act No. 496, as amended*
*   STI, claiming prior purchase of the property covered by TCT No. T-28301, filed a petition to annul the RTC order based on extrinsic fraud.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Peñalosa's Liability:**  Potential liability for misrepresentation and perjury if he falsely claimed the title was lost.
*   **STI's Risk:**  Loss of claim to property and potential need to litigate ownership in a separate action.
*   **Void Title Risk:** The duplicate title issued to Penalosa is void as the original was not actually lost.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Case Law:**

*   **Extrinsic Fraud:** STI argued extrinsic fraud due to Peñalosa's alleged misrepresentation that the title was lost. The Court rejected this, citing *Palanca v. American Food Manufacturing Co.* (24 SCRA 819), holding that the alleged perjury during trial does not constitute extrinsic fraud, as it did not prevent STI from participating in the proceeding.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The central contention is the RTC's lack of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court, citing *Serra Serra v. Court of Appeals* (195 SCRA 482), *Demetriou v. Court of Appeals* (238 SCRA 158), and *New Durawood Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (253 SCRA 740) held that the RTC lacked jurisdiction to order the issuance of a new title since the original was not actually lost but was in STI's possession. The Court reiterated that under *Section 2, Rule 47 of the Rules of Court*, a final judgment may be annulled based on lack of jurisdiction.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act), Section 109:** Basis for the RTC's order to issue a new duplicate title.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 1529, Section 110:** Jurisdiction over judicial reconstitution of lost or destroyed titles.
*   **Republic Act 26:** Relates to the judicial reconstitution of lost or destroyed titles.
*   **Rules of Court, Section 2, Rule 47:** Grounds for annulment of a final judgment.

**Outcome & Implications:**

*   The Supreme Court **granted** STI's petition, reversed the CA decision, and annulled the RTC order, declaring the newly issued duplicate title void.
*   The decision *does not* settle the issue of ownership. Ownership must be litigated in a separate appropriate proceeding.

**Potential Next Steps:**

*   STI must file a separate action to establish its ownership over the property.
*   Peñalosa could defend his claim to ownership in such a proceeding.
