**Case Summary: *Cafranca v. People* (G.R. Nos. 244071 & 244208, May 15, 2024)**

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA decision affirming the RTC conviction of Petitioners for Homicide under Article 249 in relation to Article 4(1) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Facts:** A heated argument between neighbors (Cafranca's dog barking) led to the death of Oscar Duran. The prosecution alleged that the petitioners' threatening acts and vexatious words caused Duran to suffer cardiorespiratory arrest. The defense denied the charges. The RTC found petitioners guilty of homicide, finding a causal link between their actions and Duran's death under Article 4(1) RPC (praeter intentionem). The CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions and Analysis:**

*   **Article 4(1) RPC (Praeter Intentionem):** The SC analyzes whether the elements are satisfied: (1) a felony was committed; and (2) the wrong done was the direct consequence of the crime. The SC finds the prosecution failed to prove the elements of the crime.
*   **Proximate Cause:** The SC emphasizes the prosecution's burden to prove the causal link between the petitioners' actions and Duran's death. Cites *Yadao v. People*, *U.S. v. Embate*.
*   **Lack of Autopsy:** The SC stresses the importance of an autopsy to establish the cause of death. The SC highlights the lack of an autopsy is detrimental to the prosecution's case, especially when the alleged felony (verbal altercation) doesn't typically cause death. Cites *People v. Matyaong*, *People v. Palalon*.
*   **Death Certificate/Medical Opinion:** The Court gives little weight to the death certificate because the doctor admitted she never examined the victim and based her opinion on the relativesâ€™ statements.
*   **Information Defect**: The Court also notes the defect in the information as they found that the RTC and CA based their findings on light threats and ill-treatment, not homicide.
*   **Other Light Threats (Article 285 RPC):** The Court finds Shiela guilty of other light threats for threatening Oscar with a steel chair. The SC notes the conflicting defenses (denial vs. self-defense) and gives weight to the prosecution's witnesses. The penalty is *arresto menor* with the possibility of community service.
*   **Ill-treating Another by Deed (Article 266 RPC):** The Court acquits all petitioners of this charge. The threat to sue is not a crime. It held that ill-treating another by deed requires some physical violence or assault, not merely disrespectful language. The Court also applies *in dubio pro reo* and strict construction of penal statutes.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of Article 4(1) RPC hinged on establishing a clear causal link, which the prosecution failed to prove. The death certificate was deemed insufficient evidence.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Conviction of the homicide charge was risky given the lack of conclusive medical evidence (autopsy) linking the petitioners' actions to the victim's death.
*   Even if the cause of death was heart failure, the prosecution failed to establish that the actions of the petitioners was the proximate cause of the heart failure.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court acquitted the petitioners of homicide due to the prosecution's failure to prove the causal link between their actions and Duran's death beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court instead convicted Shiela of Other Light Threats. All Petitioners are acquitted of ill-treating another by deed, and the case highlights the importance of clear medical evidence (autopsy) and proximate causation in Article 4(1) cases.
