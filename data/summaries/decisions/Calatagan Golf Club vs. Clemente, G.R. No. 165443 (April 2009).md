## Legal Document Summary: Calatagan Golf Club, Inc. vs. Sixto Clemente, Jr.

**Case:** Calatagan Golf Club, Inc. vs. Sixto Clemente, Jr., G.R. No. 165443, April 16, 2009.

**Subject Matter:** Validity of the foreclosure and sale of a golf club share due to unpaid monthly dues.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Membership & Dues:** Calatagan's Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws mandate the payment of monthly dues by shareholders, constituting a first lien on the shares. (Art. of Incorp, Art. XII Sec 31-32 of By-Laws)
*   **Delinquency & Foreclosure:** Failure to pay dues for 60+ days leads to delinquency, potential foreclosure, and sale at public auction. (Art. XII Sec 31-32 of By-Laws)
*   **Notice Requirements:** The Corporate Secretary must notify the owner of the impending auction sale within 10 days of the board resolution.
*   **Sale & Proceeds:** The share is sold to the highest bidder, and the proceeds are used to cover outstanding debts, with any surplus returned to the former member.

**Obligations:**

*   **Clemente:** Obligated to pay monthly dues as per the club's Articles and By-Laws.
*   **Calatagan:** Obligated to provide proper notice of delinquency and impending auction sale, adhering strictly to its By-Laws. Specifically, must give or cause to be given, all notices required by law or by these By-Laws. Keep a record of the addresses of all stockholders, and notify the owner and advise the membership committee of the sale at auction.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Calatagan:** Found liable for failing to provide adequate notice to Clemente, acting in bad faith by sending final notice to a known closed address. Liable for moral and exemplary damages for violating Clemente's right to due process (Art 32 Civil Code) and causing him mental anguish (Article 2217 Civil Code), justifying exemplary damages under Article 2229 of the Civil Code.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Strict Compliance with By-Laws:** The case highlights the importance of strictly adhering to corporate By-Laws, especially concerning member rights and due process. Failure to do so can result in liability.
*   **Good Faith Requirement:** Underscores the obligation to act in good faith and with justice towards members (Articles 19, 20 and 21 of the Civil Code), even when contractual obligations exist. "A certificate of stock cannot be a charter of dehumanization".
*   **Notice Adequacy:** Reliance solely on a mailing address without exploring other available contact information (residential address, phone numbers) may be deemed insufficient notice, especially when the mailing address is known to be unreliable.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code:** Sections 68 and 69 regarding sale of delinquent stock were deemed inapplicable. Section 91 regarding termination of membership.
*   **Civil Code:** Articles 19, 20, 21 (Human Relations), Article 32 (Violation of due process), Article 1140 (Prescription for recovery of movables - 8 years), Article 2217 (Moral Damages), and Article 2229 (Exemplary Damages).
*   **Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Court of Appeals:** Cited regarding the importance of simple good-faith efforts to resolve disputes.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of Section 69 of the Corporation Code was contentious. The court ruled that it only applies to unpaid subscriptions to capital stock.
*   The interpretation of "due diligence" in providing notice was contested. Sending notice to a known closed address was not deemed diligent.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding that Calatagan acted in bad faith by failing to provide adequate notice to Clemente before foreclosing on his share. The court emphasized the importance of adhering strictly to the corporate by-laws and acting in good faith towards members. This case serves as a cautionary tale for corporations regarding the need for diligent and fair treatment of their members, even when enforcing contractual obligations. The award of damages was upheld due to the violation of Clemente's rights.
