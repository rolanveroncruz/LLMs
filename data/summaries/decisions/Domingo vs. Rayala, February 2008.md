## Legal Document Summary: Domingo v. Rayala

**Case:** Consolidated Petitions (G.R. Nos. 155831, 155840, 158700) regarding the dismissal of NLRC Chairman Rogelio I. Rayala for sexual harassment.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **RA 7877 (Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995):** Defines work-related sexual harassment and establishes employer duties to prevent and investigate such acts. Focuses on "demand, request or requirement of a sexual favor" which can be discerned from the actions of the offender.
*   **Administrative Order (AO) 250 (DOLE):** Rules and regulations implementing RA 7877 in the Department of Labor and Employment; provides procedures for investigation and defines forms of sexual harassment.  While cited, its applicability to the NLRC and presidential appointees is disputed.
*   **Republic Act (RA) 6713:** Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, violation of which constitutes disgraceful and immoral conduct.
*   **Labor Code, Article 215:** Conditions the NLRC Chairman's tenure on good behavior.
*   **Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Governs administrative penalties.

**Factual Background:**

*   Ma. Lourdes T. Domingo, a Stenographic Reporter at the NLRC, filed a complaint against then NLRC Chairman Rogelio I. Rayala for sexual harassment based on repeated instances of verbal and physical advances, inappropriate comments, and the giving of money under questionable circumstances.
*   The DOLE investigated, and the Office of the President (OP) ultimately dismissed Rayala for disgraceful and immoral conduct.
*   Rayala appealed, and the Court of Appeals (CA) initially affirmed the dismissal but later modified it to a one-year suspension.

**Core Legal Issues:**

1.  **Did Rayala commit sexual harassment?**
2.  **If so, what is the appropriate penalty?**

**Ruling and Analysis:**

*   **Sexual Harassment Found:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's finding that Rayala committed sexual harassment based on substantial evidence. The actions, though possibly lacking explicit demands for sexual favors, created an intimidating, hostile, and offensive work environment for Domingo, thereby meeting the criteria under RA 7877. The Court held that the *Aquino v. Acosta* case was inapposite due to the differing factual circumstances. Rayala's actions created a hostile work environment, were conducted mostly within the confines of his office with the Complainant. The court also clarified that since this was an adminstrative offense that did not follow criminal procedure. The case can proceed based on substantial evidence.
*   **Penalty Modified:** The SC found that the Office of the President erred in imposing the penalty of dismissal. Under Civil Service Rules and Administrative Order 250, the first offense of disgraceful and immoral conduct or sexual harassment is punishable by suspension of six months and one day to one year. The aggravating circumstance of Rayala taking advantage of his position only warrants the imposition of the *maximum* penalty of suspension, not dismissal, for a first offense.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Rayala:** Liable for sexual harassment. Subject to a one-year suspension from service.
*   **Office of the President:** Has the power to discipline presidential appointees, but this power is limited by law. Must impose penalties consistent with applicable rules and regulations.
*   **Employers/Heads of Office:** Have a duty to prevent sexual harassment, establish procedures for resolution, and promulgate appropriate rules and regulations (RA 7877).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Liability for Sexual Harassment:** Rayala could be subject to civil and criminal charges.
*   **Reversal on Appeal:** Although unlikely, the SC's decision could be challenged on appeal.
*   **Future Misconduct:** Rayala remains in a position where further misconduct could lead to dismissal.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7877:** Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995.
*   **RA 6713:** Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.
*   **AO 250:** Rules and Regulations Implementing RA 7877 in the Department of Labor and Employment
*   **Aquino v. Acosta:** Case cited by the respondent.
*   **Labor Code:** Section 215 covers security of tenure and good behavior, and covers NLRC chairmen.
*   **Civil Service Rules:** Section 22(o) Rule XVI, Section 52 A(15)
*   **Presidential Decree No. 442: THE Labor Code of the Philippines**
*   **Executive Order No. 292:**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Applicability of AO 250 to presidential appointees and the NLRC:** Rayala argued AO 250 expands the scope of RA 7877 and is not applicable to him. The Court sidestepped this issue, focusing instead on the overall violation of RA 7877.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately found against Rayala and upheld a penalty of one year of suspension from service for sexual harassment, modifying the earlier penalty of dismissal, which was viewed as excessive for a first offense.
