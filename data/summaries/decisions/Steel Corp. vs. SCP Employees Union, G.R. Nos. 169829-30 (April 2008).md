Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision (G.R. Nos. 169829-30), formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Steel Corporation of the Philippines vs. SCP Employees Union-National Federation of Labor Unions* (574 Phil. 716)

**Issue:**  The central issue is the legality of the strike conducted by SCPEU-NAFLU and the propriety of the NLRC orders directing SCP to recognize and bargain with the Union and reinstate dismissed employees.

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court (SC) *partially granted* SCP's petition, finding the strike illegal and reversing the order to reinstate the union officers who participated in it.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Illegality of the Strike:** The SC determined the strike was illegal for three primary reasons:
    *   **Union-Recognition Strike:** Aimed to force SCP to recognize SCPEU-NAFLU without a valid basis for demanding collective bargaining. The SC emphasized *Association of Independent Unions in the Philippines (AIUP) v. NLRC* as precedent for the impermissibility of recognition strikes without proper certification.
    *   **Violation of Art. 263(g) and Art. 264 Labor Code:** The strike occurred after the Secretary of Labor had assumed jurisdiction and certified the dispute to the NLRC for compulsory arbitration *and* in violation of the return-to-work order (RTW) from the Labor Secretary.  The SC cited *Philcom Employees Union v. Philippine Global Communications* regarding the broad discretion afforded to the Secretary of Labor. The strike was a prohibited activity under Art. 264 Labor Code.
    *   **Defiance of CA Order:** Staging a strike instead of abiding by the CA ruling.

*   **Termination of Union Officers:** Citing Art. 264 of the Labor Code, the SC upheld SCP's right to terminate union officers who knowingly participated in the illegal strike, noting the distinction between officers and rank-and-file members. The employer has the option to terminate union officers *Santa Rosa Coca-Cola Plant Employees Union v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc.*

*   **Res Judicata:** SCP argued res judicata based on a prior NLRC ruling concerning a previous strike. The SC ruling does not explicitly address if the NLRC decisions were final, but if so the doctrine applies.

*   **Return to Work:** The SC re-emphasizes *Telefunken Semiconductors Employees Union v. Court of Appeals* as a basis for ordering reinstatement of employees.

**Obligations:**

*   **SCP:** No longer obligated to recognize or bargain with SCPEU-NAFLU.
*   **SCPEU-NAFLU Officers:** Loss of employment.

**Liabilities:**

*   SCPEU-NAFLU may be liable for damages resulting from the illegal strike, although not explicitly stated.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Wrongful Dismissal Claims:** Risk exists if SCP terminated rank-and-file members without proving their specific illegal acts during the strike.
*   **Future Labor Disputes:** Underlying issues leading to prior strikes remain unresolved, potentially causing further unrest.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Knowing Participation":** The SC's decision rests on "knowing participation" of officers in the illegal strike. This could be a point of contention if factual disputes exist regarding an individual officer's knowledge of the strike's illegality or active involvement.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Association of Independent Unions in the Philippines (AIUP) v. NLRC*
*   *Philcom Employees Union v. Philippine Global Communications*
*   *Telefunken Semiconductors Employees Union v. Court of Appeals*
*   *Santa Rosa Coca-Cola Plant Employees Union v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc.*

**Statutory References:**

*   Labor Code of the Philippines, Articles 263(g) and 264.

**Recommendations:**

*   Review personnel files to ensure proper documentation of each employee's participation in the strike, especially regarding union officers, to support termination decisions.
*   Consider engaging in good-faith efforts to address the underlying labor concerns that prompted the strikes, to prevent future disputes.
*   Consult with labor counsel on any specific employee terminations to minimize the risk of wrongful dismissal claims.
