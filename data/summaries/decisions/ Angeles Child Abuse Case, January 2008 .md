**Case Summary: Re: Conviction of Judge Adoracion G. Angeles, A.M. No. 06-9-545-RTC**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Judge Adoracion G. Angeles, RTC Branch 121, Caloocan City, stemming from her conviction in Criminal Case Nos. Q-97-69655-56 for violation of RA 7610 (Child Abuse).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Conviction of RA 7610 (Child Abuse):** The core issue revolves around the administrative implications of Judge Angeles' conviction in a criminal case, specifically whether it warrants disciplinary action and preventive suspension, even pending appeal.

*   **Preventive Suspension:** The OCA initially recommended indefinite suspension pending the outcome of the criminal appeal. This Court considers whether grounds exist for such a suspension, given the presumption of innocence until final conviction. It notes that the existing rules on preventive suspension of judges are amorphous.

*   **Due Process:** Judge Angeles argued she was denied due process by the initial suspension order, which was issued without furnishing her a copy of the OCA complaint. This suspension was initially lifted, but the issue of suspending her was still considered by the court.

*   **Indirect Contempt:** Judge Angeles sought to cite Senior State Prosecutor (SSP) Velasco for indirect contempt based on statements in his pleadings, which she alleged degraded the administration of justice. This motion was denied, but SSP Velasco was cautioned to use more circumspect language in the future.

*   **Intemperate Language:** The Court criticized both Judge Angeles and SSP Velasco for using offensive and disrespectful language in their pleadings.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judges' Conduct:**  The decision emphasizes the high standards of conduct and temperament expected of judges, both in their official duties and personal lives. It cites previous case law and the Code of Professional Responsibility.

*   **Lawyers' Conduct:** It reminds lawyers to maintain respect for the courts and judicial officers, and to use dignified and respectful language in their professional dealings, citing the Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Abuse of Process:** The Court recognizes the risk of administrative or criminal charges being used to harass judges. It emphasizes that charges must be examined carefully and instituted only on lawful grounds and in pursuit of truth and justice.

*   **Influence of Position:**  SSP Velasco argued that Judge Angeles could use her position to influence the outcome of her criminal appeal, potentially impacting the integrity of the judiciary. This argument failed to persuade the court with the facts presented.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7610:** Child Abuse Law, basis for the criminal conviction.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 71, Section 4:** Procedure for initiating indirect contempt proceedings (verified petition required).
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Canons 8 & 11:**  Ethical duties of lawyers to use respectful language and maintain respect for the courts.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 807, sec. 41; 1987 Revised Administrative Code, Book V, Title I, Subtitle A, Chapter 6, Sec. 5:** Concerning preventive suspension.
*   **Emmanuel Ymson Velasco v. Judge Adoracion G. Angeles, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1908:** Previous administrative case involving the same parties, establishing that acts unrelated to judicial functions can give rise to administrative liability, and conviction in a criminal case will not automatically warrant a finding of guilt in the administrative case.  Criminal and civil cases are altogether different from administrative matters.
*   **Nu√±ez v. Atty. Arturo B. Astorga, A.C. No. 6131:** Mere existence of pending criminal charges is not grounds for disbarment/suspension.
*   **Mangubat v. Sandiganbayan, 227 Phil. 642, 646 (1986):** Constitution presumption of innocence prevails until promulgation of final conviction.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Amorphous" Rules on Preventive Suspension:** The court's acknowledgment that the rules regarding preventive suspension of judges are "amorphous" indicates a lack of clear guidelines, making it difficult to determine when such a suspension is appropriate, and leaving room for discretionary interpretation.
*   **"Cause Pressure to Bear":** SSP Velasco's language was not contemptuous but still disrespectful. The court considered the possibility of a judge influencing the appellate process and that the appellate judges or OSG were subject to influence, which can be construed as a criticism of the appellate process.

**Conclusion:**

The Court dismissed the administrative complaint and denied the motion to cite SSP Velasco for contempt. However, it reprimanded Judge Angeles for using intemperate language and warned both her and SSP Velasco to be more circumspect in their pleadings in the future. The Court directed the Court of Appeals to resolve the pending criminal appeal with dispatch. The key takeaway is the emphasis on maintaining high standards of conduct for both judges and lawyers, even amidst personal conflicts and legal disputes.
