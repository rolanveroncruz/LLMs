## Legal Document Summary: Fernandez v. HRET & Vicente (G.R. No. 187478)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition challenging the HRET's decision in a quo warranto case (HRET CASE No. 07-034) declaring Petitioner Fernandez ineligible for office as Representative of the First District of Laguna due to lack of residency.

**Key Issue:** Whether the HRET committed grave abuse of discretion in finding Fernandez ineligible due to lack of the constitutionally mandated one-year residency requirement (Art. VI, Sec. 6, 1987 Constitution). Specifically, whether the HRET erred in its interpretation and application of the residency requirement given the evidence presented. Also, the concurrent jurisdiction of HRET and COMELEC.

**HRET Decision:** Declared Fernandez ineligible based on a finding of insufficient residency in the First District of Laguna. The HRET questioned the validity of the presented lease contract and the credibility of witnesses supporting Fernandez's residency, emphasizing his domicile of origin in Pagsanjan.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Art. VI, Sec. 6, 1987 Constitution:** Establishes the one-year residency requirement for members of the House of Representatives in the district they represent.
*   **Art. VI, Sec. 17, 1987 Constitution:** Grants the HRET the *sole* jurisdiction to judge contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of members of the House.
*   **Rule 17, 1998 Rules of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal:** Establishes the rules regarding quo warranto petitions for members of the House.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Traditionally on the petitioner in a quo warranto case (Jesus Vicente). The HRET shifted the burden onto the respondent (Danilo Ramon S. Fernandez) to prove he had abandoned his domicile of origin.

**Potential Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Vacation of Office:** The original HRET decision ordered Fernandez to vacate his office.
*   **Electoral Instability:** Uncertainty regarding representation in the First District of Laguna.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. VI, Sec. 6 & 17, 1987 Constitution:** Constitutional basis for the residency requirement and HRET jurisdiction.
*   **COMELEC Rules & Regulations (regarding candidate qualifications):** Potentially relevant in interpreting residency requirements.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 131, Sec. 1:** Standard on burden of proof.
*   **Frivaldo v. COMELEC:**  Reiterates the importance of upholding the will of the electorate.
*   **Perez v. COMELEC:** Addresses the probative value of contracts of lease as evidence of residency.
*   **Aquino v. COMELEC:** Previously emphasized the importance of property ownership; the SC in this case distinguished this circumstance and found that not only did petitioner establish ties through business interests and school proximity, but, also purchased property in Santa Rosa.
*   **Domino v. COMELEC:** Where only purpose for residency appeared to be for election purposes.
*   **Mallari v. Alsol:** Validates leases even if they do not have notarization.
*   **Gallego v. Vera:** The purpose of law would not be thwarted by upholding the right to the office, the will of the electorate should be respected.
*   **Japzon v. COMELEC:** Domicile requirements for public office (animus revertendi).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Residence":**  The application of *animus manendi* (intent to remain) and *animus non revertendi* (intent to abandon) in determining domicile and residency.  The HRET's interpretation was seen as overly restrictive.
*   **Probative Value of Lease Agreements:** The HRET heavily scrutinized the lease agreement, questioning its validity and giving less weight to it than the Petitioner's domicile of origin.
*   **Burden of Proof:** While the petitioner for a quo warranto generally holds the burden of proof, the extent to which this burden shifts to the respondent after establishing a domicile of origin.
*   **Forum-Shopping:** The petitioner claimed that the COMELEC already passed judgement, but because the cases are distinct, that claim failed.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** GRANTED the Petition, reversed and set aside the HRET's decision and resolution. The SC held the HRET's interpretation of the residency requirement to be overly restrictive. They determined Fernandez did adequately prove his intent to reside and fulfill the residency requirement and that this court must exercise utmost caution before disqualifying a winning candidate, especially when the candidate is the clear choice of the constituents he or she wishes to represent.
