**Subject:** Summary of A.M. No. CA-09-48-J (Administrative Complaint Against Justice Dicdican)

**Overview:** This document is a Supreme Court Resolution dismissing an administrative complaint filed by The Law Firm of Chavez Miranda Aseoche against Justice Isaias P. Dicdican of the Court of Appeals for alleged violation of Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct relating to impartiality and the appearance of impropriety. The complaint stemmed from Justice Dicdican's initial involvement in CA-G.R. CEB-SP-No. 00440, a certiorari petition concerning disciplinary sanctions against a student.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Initial Involvement:** Justice Dicdican initially penned a TRO in favor of the school (St. Mary Mazzarello).
*   **Inhibition:** Justice Dicdican voluntarily inhibited himself after a motion alleging his prior representation of religious organizations created an appearance of bias.
*   **Alleged Continued Participation:** The core allegation is that Justice Dicdican *continued* to participate in the case after his inhibition, specifically signing a Resolution dated 21 November 2006.
*   **Violation Alleged:** Violation of Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct (impartiality and avoidance of impropriety). Rules 2.01 and 2.03 specifically mentioned.

**Defense & Findings:**

*   **Denial of Continued Participation:** Justice Dicdican denied any involvement after his inhibition, stating the case file was no longer with him.
*   **Typographical Error:** The court accepted the explanation that the appearance of his signature on the 21 November 2006 Resolution was a clerical error by a stenographer (supported by an apology letter).
*   **Reraffling:** The case was reraffled to Justice Lanzanas and later to Justice Barza.
*   **Failure of Proof:** The Supreme Court found that the complainant failed to provide sufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations. The presumption of regularity in the performance of duties applied.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judges' Obligation:** To avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety (Canon 2, Code of Judicial Conduct). The Code of Judicial Conduct is the relevant statutory reference.
*   **Complainant's Burden of Proof:** The complainant bears the burden of proving the allegations in administrative proceedings.  *Suarez-De Leon v. Estrella* (A.M. No. RTJ-05-1935, July 29, 2005) reinforces this principle.
*   **No Liability Established:** Justice Dicdican was found not liable for any violation.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Appearance of Impropriety:** Even though the complaint was dismissed, the initial concerns regarding prior representation and the subsequent signature error could still raise questions about the judiciary's impartiality.
*   **Procedural Errors:** The stenographer's error highlights the importance of careful record-keeping and review processes within the Court of Appeals.
*   **Inappropriate Use of Administrative Complaint:** The Court reiterates that an administrative complaint is not the appropriate remedy for perceived errors if other judicial remedies are available. Cites *Atty. Hilario v. Hon. Ocampo III* (422 Phil. 593) and *Santos v. Orlino*.
*   **Absence of Concrete Evidence:** The weakness of the complainant's case and reliance on circumstantial evidence proved fatal.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2, Rules 2.01, 2.03:** Governing standard for judicial conduct.
*   **Suarez-De Leon v. Estrella, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1935, July 29, 2005, 465 SCRA 37, 44:** Establishes the complainant's burden of proof.
*   **Atty. Hilario v. Hon. Ocampo III, 422 Phil. 593, 606 (2001):** States that administrative complaints should not be used if other judicial remedies exist. Cites *Dionisio v. Escano, A.M. No. RTJ-98-1400, February 1, 1999, 302 SCRA 411; See Geriatrics Foundation, Inc. v. Layosa, 416 Phil. 668 (2001).*
*   **Santos v. Orlino, Adm. Mat. No. RTJ-98-1418, September 25, 1998, 296 SCRA 101:** The same.

**Conclusion:** The administrative complaint against Justice Dicdican was dismissed due to a lack of sufficient evidence. The court accepted the explanation of clerical error and upheld the presumption of regularity. However, the case highlights potential risks associated with the appearance of impropriety and the importance of proper procedures in court administration.
