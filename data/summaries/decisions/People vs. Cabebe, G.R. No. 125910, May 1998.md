## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Cabebe*, G.R. No. 125910

**Nature:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) Decision convicting Efren Cabebe of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Conviction:** The RTC found Cabebe guilty beyond reasonable doubt of raping Ednalyn Daboc.
*   **Sentence:** Reclusion Perpetua, civil interdiction for life, perpetual absolute disqualification, and P50,000 civil indemnity to the victim.

**Victim Testimony:** Ednalyn Daboc's testimony was deemed credible and sufficient to establish guilt.

**Liabilities:** Cabebe is liable for:

*   Serving the sentence of Reclusion Perpetua.
*   Civil indemnity of P50,000 to Ednalyn Daboc.
*   Associated accessory penalties (civil interdiction, perpetual disqualification).

**Defense Arguments & Rebuttals:**

*   **Alibi:** Cabebe claimed he was at work at the time of the incident. The Court found this unconvincing because location was in proximity of the crime.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** The defense questioned the victim's delay in reporting the rape. The Court acknowledged that the child was intimidated and threats made.
*   **Lack of Cross-Examination:** Cabebe alleged he was denied the right to cross-examine a source of the information about the rape. Court refuted that she was required to present and Cabebe was free to subpoena.
*   **Lack of Penetration Evidence:** Cabebe argued that medical evidence (intact hymen) contradicted the rape claim. The Court cited existing jurisprudence and medical testimony that even slight penetration is enough for rape, and there doesn't need to be a rupturing of the hymen to constitute to crime of rape.
*   **Credibility:** The defense argued that the victim's veracity. The Court stated appellate courts will not disturb findings of trail courts.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Reliance on Victim Testimony:** The conviction heavily relies on the victim's testimony. The defense might challenge the application of the principles of this reliance.
*   **Alibi Failure:** The prosecution may challenge that the alibi raised has already been discredited.
*   **Intact Hymen:** The defense could continue to challenge penetration because of the intact hymen.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335, Revised Penal Code:** Defines rape and penalties.
*   **People vs. Catoltol, Sr., 265 SCRA 109, 117:** Confirms that the complaint of the victim is all that is need to determine the existence of the crime.
*   **People vs. Palicte, 229 SCRA 543, 547-548:** Medical evidence is just one piece of the determination if rape exists. It doesn't need deep penetration to be the crime.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Elasticity of Hymen:** The argument over whether or not the hymen broke is an example.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the RTC decision, affirming Cabebe's conviction for rape. The judgment hinged on the credibility of the victim's testimony, bolstered by the lack of any apparent motive for false accusation and failure to show alibi.
