**Case Summary: *Goretti Ong v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 165275 (2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC conviction of Petitioner for Estafa under Art. 315, para. 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Issue:** Whether the Petitioner was properly convicted of Estafa under Art. 315, para. 2(a) when the Information alleged facts constituting Estafa under Art. 315, para. 2(d) and whether the prosecution sufficiently proved all elements of estafa under Art. 315, para. 2(d)

**Facts:**
*   Petitioner (Ong) issued ten checks to the private complainant (Cabuso) in payment for jewelry.
*   The checks were dishonored due to "Account Closed."
*   Petitioner was charged with Estafa, without specifying the mode under Art. 315 RPC.
*   RTC convicted Ong of Estafa under Art. 315, para. 2(a) (false pretenses).
*   CA affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty.
*   The prosecution admitted to a partial payment made by the petitioner for the jewelry in the amount of P338,250

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Information:** The Information alleged Ong issued checks knowing she had insufficient funds, which alleges facts constituting Estafa under Art. 315, para. 2(d) (issuing bouncing checks).
*   **Art. 315, para. 2(a) vs. 2(d) RPC:** The Supreme Court emphasizes the critical distinction between these two modes of committing estafa. Para 2(a) requires false pretenses/fraudulent acts, and para 2(d) requires notice of dishonor and failure to deposit funds within three days, creating a *prima facie* presumption of deceit.
*   **Constitutional Right to be Informed:** The Court cites Section 14(2) of Article III of the Constitution, emphasizing the accused's right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation.
*   **Lack of Notice of Dishonor:** The Court found no evidence presented regarding notice of dishonor of all but one of the checks, a crucial element for establishing Estafa under Art. 315, para. 2(d).

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court **granted** the petition and **acquitted** Goretti Ong of the crime of Estafa.
*   Judgment bearing on civil liability is AFFIRMED

**Reasoning:**

*   Convicting Ong under Art. 315, para. 2(a) violates her right to be informed of the charges, as the Information clearly alleged facts under Art. 315, para. 2(d).
*   The prosecution failed to prove all elements of Estafa under Art. 315, para. 2(d), specifically notice of dishonor for majority of the checks. The *prima facie* presumption of knowledge of insufficient funds did not arise for most of the checks.
*   The Court finds Petitioner's defense of good faith credible, supported by partial payments made to the private complainant

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Almendral, G.R. No. 126025 (2004):**  Reinforces the constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation.
*   **People v. Ojeda, G.R. Nos. 104238-58 (2004):** Emphasizes the necessity of notice of dishonor for prosecution under both Art. 315, para. 2(d) RPC and B.P. 22.
*   **Garcia v. People, 457 Phil. 713 (2003):** Distinguished as inapplicable, as the issue there was not whether the Information accurately reflected the crime for which the accused was convicted.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Civil Liability:** Although acquitted of the crime, Ong remains civilly liable for the debt, representing a continued financial risk.
*   **B.P. 22 charges:** The decision mentions pending B.P. 22 charges against Ong. The SC acquittal on Estafa due to lack of notice of dishonor will likely impact those cases, potentially leading to acquittals there as well, *Ojeda* supports this conclusion as notice of dishonor is also required for conviction under B.P. 22

**Recommendations:**

*   Defend client against the civil liabilty, arguing any partial payments made.
*   Move to dismiss B.P. 22 cases based on the established lack of notice of dishonor.
