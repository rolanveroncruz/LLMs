**Summary of *Office of the Court Administrator vs. Vladimir A. Bravo***

**Case:** Consolidated administrative cases (A.M. No. P-17-3710 and A.M. No. P-18-3822) regarding the habitual absenteeism of Vladimir A. Bravo, a Court Interpreter II.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Violation:** Bravo is charged with habitual absenteeism for the periods September 2012 to February 2013, and March 2013 to May 2013. He incurred 72.5 absences in 2012 and 61 absences in 2013.
*   **CSC Memorandum Circular No. 4, Series of 1991:** Defines habitual absenteeism as exceeding allowable leave credits (2.5 days/month) for at least three months in a semester or three consecutive months in a year.
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service. Due to Bravo's resignation, the penalty is forfeiture of all benefits (except accrued leave credits) and disqualification from re-employment in any government agency, including GOCCs.
*   **Admission by Silence:** The Court Administrator considered Bravo's failure to comment on the charges as an admission of guilt, citing *Mendoza v. Tablizo, 614 Phil. 30, 39 (2009)*.

**Obligations:**

*   Court employees are obligated to observe official time and avoid unauthorized absences.

**Liabilities:**

*   Bravo is liable for habitual absenteeism.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The penalty is applied despite Bravo's resignation. While resignation might typically moot an administrative case, the Court here applied the penalty to prevent future government employment.
*   No mitigating circumstances were considered.
*   **Statutory/Regulatory References:** Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular No. 4, Series of 1991, Administrative Circular No. 14-2002 and The Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service
*   **Case Law:** *Re: Habitual Absenteeism of Mr. Fernando P. Pascual, 507 Phil. 546, 549 (2005); Mendoza v. Tablizo, 614 Phil. 30, 39 (2009); Judge Arabani, Jr. v. Arabani, A.M. Nos. SCC-10-14-P, SCC-10-15-P & SCC-11-17, February 21, 2017; Office of the Court Administrator v. Alfonso, A.M. No. P-17-3634, March 1, 2017; RE: Habitual Absenteeism of Eva Rowena J. Ypil, Court Legal Researcher II, Regional Trial Court, Branch 143 Makati City, 555 Phil. 1, 7-8 (2007); Balloguing v. Dagan, A.M. No. P-17-3645, January 30, 2018.*

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court found Bravo guilty of habitual absenteeism and imposed the penalties of forfeiture of benefits and disqualification from future government employment, despite his resignation. The decision reinforces the strict adherence to official time and attendance expected of court personnel and demonstrates that resignation is not necessarily a bar to administrative sanctions.
