## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Medina* (G.R. No. 113691)

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Alberto Medina y Catud*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, First Division

**Citation:** 349 Phil. 718 (1998)

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of a conviction for murder. The key issues on appeal are the defenses of insanity, lack of premeditation, and claim of voluntary surrender.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** The lower court convicted Medina of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* and ordering him to pay damages to the heirs of the victim, Andres Dalisay.
*   **Insanity Defense (Art. 12, par. 1, RPC):** The Supreme Court rejected the appellant's insanity defense. The court heavily relies on the presumption of sanity and notes that the burden of proof is on the defendant to show a complete loss of reason or discernment *at the time of the commission of the crime*. The defense failed to meet this burden. The expert testimony of Dr. Adigue, a psychologist, was deemed insufficient, with emphasis on the fact that (1) tests revealed accused mental activity was functioning on a normal level at the time of evaluation; (2) he comprehended instructions fast and [was] never hesitant to take the said examinations.
    *   The Court cites *People v. Formigones* (87 Phil. 658) and *People v. Rafanan* (204 SCRA 65) to highlight the requirement of *complete* deprivation of rationality.
    *   Distinguishes from *People v. Bonoan* (64 Phil. 87) where alienist reports confirmed mental disorders, and notes that Medina was only diagnosed with mild depression.
    *   References Art. 800 of the Civil Code regarding the presumption of sanity.
*   **Treachery (Qualifying Circumstance):** The Court upheld the lower court's finding of treachery based on the testimony of a witness (Andal) who stated that the attack was sudden and unexpected, with Medina ambushing the victim and inflicting multiple wounds even after the victim was incapacitated. Cites cases *People vs. Marolano, People vs. Sol*
*   **Evident Premeditation (Aggravating Circumstance):** The Court reversed the lower court's finding of evident premeditation, stating that the short time between Medina leaving his sister's house and the attack did not allow for sufficient reflection on the consequences of his actions. Cites *People vs. Estrellanes, People vs. Layno*
*   **Voluntary Surrender (Mitigating Circumstance):** The Court recognized the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, finding that Medina surrendered to authorities (Wilfredo Sevillano) shortly after the incident, fulfilling the elements of non-arrest, surrender to authority, and voluntary action. Cites *People vs. Isleta, People vs. Castillo*

**Penalties and Liabilities:**

*   Initially sentenced to Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Modified Penalty:** Due to the presence of the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, the Supreme Court modified the sentence, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4103). Medina was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of ten years and one day of *prisión mayor* maximum (minimum) and seventeen years, four months, and one day of *reclusión temporal* maximum (maximum).
*   The payment of 50,000 pesos to the victim's heirs was sustained.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Standard for Insanity:** The case reaffirms a high threshold for proving insanity as an exempting circumstance, requiring a complete deprivation of reason, making it difficult for defendants with mental health issues to successfully raise this defense.
*   **Subjectivity of Expert Testimony:** The Court's rejection of the psychologist's testimony highlights the subjectivity involved in assessing expert witnesses and the potential for judicial discretion to undermine such evidence.
*   **Application of Indeterminate Sentence Law:** The correct application of penalty periods within the Revised Penal Code, specifically Art. 64, highlights the complexities and potential for misinterpretation in sentencing. This case clarifies the inapplicability of Art. 63 (indivisible penalties) due to the availability of a range of penalties based on mitigating circumstances.
*   **Timing for determination of Insanity:** It is important to note that in the Medina case the testing was done 4 months prior to the crime.
