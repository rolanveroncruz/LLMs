**Case Summary: China Banking Corporation v. Asian Construction and Development Corporation (ACDC), G.R. No. 158271, April 8, 2008**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari (treated as a Petition for Certiorari) regarding an interlocutory order by the Court of Appeals (CA).

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in denying China Bank's motion for authority to sell attached properties of ACDC *pendente lite* (before final judgment) in a collection suit.

**Facts:**

*   China Bank granted ACDC a P90M credit line.
*   China Bank filed a collection suit against ACDC alleging misappropriation of receivables.
*   A writ of preliminary attachment was issued and levied on ACDC's personal properties (vehicles, equipment, office machines).
*   RTC granted Summary Judgment to China Bank. ACDC appealed.
*   China Bank sought permission to sell the attached properties before the final judgment. The CA denied this motion.
*   China Bank filed a petition with the Supreme Court, questioning the denial.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 57, Section 11 of the Rules of Court:** Governs the sale of attached property before entry of judgment. The court may order a sale if the property is perishable or if the interests of all parties will be subserved.
*   **Rule 57, Section 4 of the Rules of Court:** Applicant is obligated to provide a bond to the adverse party in the amount fixed by the court and conditioned that the latter will pay all the costs which may be adjudged to the adverse party and all the damages which he may sustain by reason of the attachment, if the court shall finally adjudge that the applicant was not entitled thereto

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Depreciation of Assets:** China Bank argued that the attached properties are depreciating and exposed to the elements. They will continue to lose their worth thereby rendering the rules on preliminary attachment nugatory.
*   **ACDC's Potential Damages:** If the attachment is deemed wrongful, China Bank is liable on its bond for ACDC's damages resulting from the attachment *itself*, not the sale of the attached properties before a final judgment.
*   **Possible reversal on appeal** If the decision of the lower court is reversed and a final judgment rendered in favor ACDC, great prejudice will result if the attached properties were already sold.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 57, Sections 4 and 11, Rules of Court:**  The core procedural rules governing preliminary attachment and sale of attached properties.
*   **Witherspoon v. Cross, 135 Cal. 96, 67 Pac. 18 (Dec. 14, 1901):**  Definition of "perishable property" (cited by China Bank; goods which decay and lose their value if not speedily put to their intended use; but where the time contemplated is necessarily long, the term may embrace property liable merely to material depreciation in value from other causes than such decay.)
*   **Mossler Acceptance Co. v. Denmark, 211 La. 1078, 31 So. 2d 216 (1947):** Automobiles are not perishable under attachment statutes.
*   **McCreery v. Berney National Bank, 116 Ala. 224, 22 So. 577 (1897):** Interprets "perishable" property broadly to include items that will likely become worthless to the creditor if kept until litigation ends.
*   **Millard’s Admrs. v. Hall, 24 Ala. 209 (1854):** An attached property is perishable “if it is shown that, by keeping the article, it will necessarily become, or is likely to become, worthless to the creditor, and by consequence to the debtor, then it is embraced by the statute.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Definition of "Perishable Property":**  Whether vehicles and office equipment qualify as "perishable" under Rule 57, Section 11. The SC cites conflicting US jurisprudence. The facts presented by the petitioner were also presented for the first time during appeal.
*   **Balancing Interests:** Balancing China Bank's interest in preserving asset value against ACDC's interest in preserving its assets for business operations, should ACDC prevail on appeal.
*   **Equitable Remedy:** Sale of attached property before final judgement is an equitable remedy provided for the convenience of the parties and preservation of the property.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

*   The Petition is DENIED. The CA Resolutions are AFFIRMED.
*   The SC held that the issue of whether the sale of attached properties is for the convenience of the parties and that the interests of all the parties will be subserved by the said sale is a question of fact.
*   The SC did not find grave abuse of discretion by the CA. The CA properly weighed the interests of both parties.

**Legal Analysis & Potential Arguments:**

*   **China Bank's Weakness:** The failure to present evidence of depreciation before the CA severely hampered its case.
*   **ACDC's Strength:** The CA recognized that it is a corporation engaged in a construction business, the preservation of the properties is of paramount importance; and that in the event that the decision of the lower court is reversed and a final judgment rendered in favor ACDC, great prejudice will result if the attached properties were already sold.
*   **Future Litigation Strategy:** In future cases, meticulous documentation of asset condition *before* seeking sale authorization is essential. Consider independent appraisals and expert testimony.
