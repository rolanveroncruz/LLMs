## Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 166570, December 18, 2009

**Case:** *Efren M. Herrera and Esther C. Galvez vs. National Power Corporation, et al.*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Issue:** Whether former employees of the National Power Corporation (NPC), separated due to the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (EPIRA, RA 9136), are entitled to both separation pay under the EPIRA and retirement benefits under Commonwealth Act No. 186 (CA 186), as amended.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the lower court's decision that the petitioners are not entitled to both separation pay under RA 9136 *and* retirement benefits under CA 186, as amended.  The Court held that absent specific statutory authorization, receiving both constitutes double compensation, violating Section 8, Article IX(B) of the Constitution.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 9136, Section 63 (EPIRA):** Provides separation benefits for displaced NPC employees. Entitlement is *either* a separation pay and other benefits under existing laws *or* a separation plan (1.5 months' salary/year of service). This is interpreted as an *either/or* alternative, not cumulative.
*   **RA 9136 Implementing Rules, Rule 33, Section 3(f):** Defines "separation" as severance of employment of employees "who [are] neither qualified under existing laws, rules and regulations nor ha[ve] opted to retire under existing laws..." This reinforces the 'either/or' interpretation.
*   **CA 186, as amended (Retirement Law):** Provides for retirement benefits. Generally, a government employee with a 20-year service record can retire and receive monthly benefits. This also requires the refund to employees of their contributions to the fund should separation from service occur prior to official retirement.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **NPC's Liability:** Initially faced a potential liability for retirement benefits in addition to the already disbursed separation pay. The ruling clarifies the NPC does *not* have to pay both, other than the required contributions reimbursement, but could face legal challenges if it deviates from the court's interpretation.
*   **Petitioners' Loss:** The separated employees lost their claim for retirement benefits under CA 186, as they chose and received the separation plan under RA 9136.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 8, Article IX(B) of the Constitution:** Prohibits additional, double, or indirect compensation unless specifically authorized by law.
*   **RA 6656, Section 9:** Addressed in petitioners' argument, but the court rejected their interpretation.
*   **CSC Resolution No. 021112 & 00-1957:** Cited to demonstrate that the Civil Service Commission also interprets "separation pay and retirement" as alternative, not cumulative, benefits.
*   ***Cajiuat v. Mathay* (209 Phil. 579):** Held that gratuity laws should be construed against double compensation unless explicitly stated otherwise.  This case reinforces the need for clear statutory authorization for double benefits.
*   ***Laraño v. Commission on Audit* (G.R. No. 164542):** Distinguished; *Laraño* involved an Early Retirement Incentive Plan explicitly providing for both separation package and retirement benefits, unlike the present case.  There must be specific authority for the grant of both separation pay and retirement benefits
*   ***Development Bank of the Philippines v. Commission on Audit* (467 Phil. 62 (2004):** Clarified that right to retirement benefits accrues only upon certain prerequisites and the fulfillment of the conditions imposed by the applicable law, as well as actual retirement.
*   ***Centeno v. Villalon-Pornillos*, G.R. No. 113092:** Emphasized when `or' is used, the various members of the enumeration are to be taken separately.
*   ***Sadueste v. Municipality of Surigao*, 72 Phil. 485 (1941):** The authority required by the Constitution to receive double or additional compensation is a specific authority given to a particular employee or officer of the Government because of peculiar or exceptional reasons warranting the payment of extra or additional compensation.
*   ***Santos v. Court of Appeals*, 399 Phil. 282 (2000):** The Court categorically answered this question in the negative, holding that: "to credit his years of service in the Judiciary in the computation of his separation pay under R.A. No. 7924 notwithstanding the fact that he had received or has been receiving the retirement benefits under R.A. No. 910, as amended, would be to countenance double compensation for exactly the same services.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "separation pay and other benefits" in RA 9136, Section 63:** The petitioners argued this meant *both* separation pay under the separation plan *and* retirement benefits. The Court disagreed, interpreting it as only one of the two options being available to the petitioners.

**Summary of Separate Concurring Opinion (Brion, J.):**

Justice Brion concurs, emphasizing that: (1) there was only one exit from service, and therefore only one separation benefit should be paid; and (2) granting both separation pay and retirement benefits amounts to prohibited additional compensation. He distinguished the Laraño case and argued that the petitioners never actually exercised their right to retire under CA 186.
