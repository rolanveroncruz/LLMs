**Case Summary: *Arthur Zarate vs. Regional Trial Court***

**Citation:** 609 Phil. 288 (G.R. No. 152263, July 3, 2009)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to overturn the Court of Appeals' decision which affirmed the RTC's conviction of Arthur Zarate for Frustrated Homicide.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Zarate was initially charged with Frustrated *Murder* under an Information alleging treachery and evident premeditation. The RTC convicted him of Frustrated *Homicide* instead, finding no proof of treachery or evident premeditation.
*   **Incident:** Zarate stabbed Ernesto Guiritan (a homosexual man), who sustained critical injuries requiring surgery. The incident occurred on Good Friday evening.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Guiritan identified Zarate as the assailant. He gave an ante-mortem statement identifying Zarate. The prosecution argued the statement was admissible as part of *res gestae*.
*   **Defense:** Zarate presented an alibi, claiming he was helping decorate an altar at the time of the stabbing.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:**
    *   **RTC:** Found Zarate guilty of Frustrated Homicide. Rejected the alibi due to proximity.
    *   **Court of Appeals:** Affirmed the RTC decision, upholding the admissibility of Guiritan's statement as *res gestae*.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** Affirmed the CA decision, upholding the conviction for Frustrated Homicide.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Zarate's Liability:**  Criminally liable for Frustrated Homicide. Required to serve an indeterminate sentence of 4 years, 2 months and 1 day of *prision correccional* to 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor*. Civilly liable to indemnify Guiritan for medical expenses (P11,580.50).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Res Gestae Argument:** The admissibility of the ante-mortem statement as *res gestae* was a central issue. The Court found the statement was a reflex product as it was taken hours after an operation, even though Guiritan had regained consciousness.
*   **Alibi:** The defense of alibi failed because Zarate couldn't prove physical impossibility to be at the crime scene, given its proximity to where he claimed he was.
*   **Lack of Evident Premeditation & Treachery:** The prosecution failed to prove these elements, leading to the reduction of the charge from Frustrated Murder to Frustrated Homicide.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 42 (Res Gestae):** Sets out the requirements for a statement to be admitted as part of the *res gestae*. The Court applied the *People v. Pe√±a* doctrine, which specified when a statement is deemed as part of res gestae.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 249 (Homicide):** Defines the crime of Homicide.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 50 (Frustrated Felony):** Specifies the penalty for a frustrated felony being one degree lower than the consummated crime.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Governs the imposition of indeterminate sentences. The court outlined the permissible range given the crime and lack of mitigating or aggravating circumstances.
*   **People v. Bulan:** Upheld the principle that conviction can be based on the testimony of a single, credible witness.
*   **People vs Juan:** Used the case's ruling in it's decision to establish the requirements for a successful defense using alibi.
*   **People vs Aliben:** Reinforced the precedence and reliability of positive identification of the defendant.
*   **People v. Segobre:** Upheld the weight and reliability that trial courts hold in determinations of witness credibility.
*   **Revised Penal Code Article 64(1):** Sets out rules for when there are no aggrivating or mitigating circumstances.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, emphasizing the positive identification by the victim, the admissibility of the statement as *res gestae*, and the failure of the alibi. The prosecution's inability to prove treachery or evident premeditation was critical in limiting the conviction to Frustrated Homicide.
