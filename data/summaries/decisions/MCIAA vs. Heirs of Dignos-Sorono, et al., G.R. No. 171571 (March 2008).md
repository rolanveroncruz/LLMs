## Legal Document Summary: *Republic of the Philippines vs. Heirs of Francisca Dignos-Sorono et al.* (G.R. No. 171571, March 24, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's decision in a Quieting of Title and Legal Redemption case.

**Key Facts:**

*   **Subject Property:** Lot Nos. 2296 and 2316, Opon Cadastre, Lapu-lapu City. Adjudicated in 1929 to four groups of heirs.
*   **Central Issue:** Validity of the sale of the entire lots by one group of heirs (heirs of Tito Dignos) to the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), predecessor of Mactan Cebu International Airport Authority (MCIAA), in 1957, without the consent of the other co-owners/heirs.
*   **Plaintiffs:** Heirs of Francisca Dignos-Sorono, Juan L. Amistoso, Brigilda D. Amistoso, Pastor Dignos, Isabel Dignos, Donata Dignos, Segunda Dignos, Gregoria Dignos, Domingo Fuentes, and Isabelo Dignos (Respondents).
*   **Defendant:** Republic of the Philippines, represented by Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority (MCIAA) (Petitioner).

**Key Provisions and Legal Analysis:**

*   **Co-ownership:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the established principle under Article 493 of the Civil Code and *Bailon-Casilao v. CA* (G.R. No. 78178, April 15, 1988, 160 SCRA 738), that a co-owner can only sell their *pro rata* share. The sale by the heirs of Tito Dignos was valid only with respect to their ¼ share.
*   **Acquisitive Prescription:** MCIAA's claim of ownership through acquisitive prescription (both ordinary and extraordinary) was rejected because the land is registered, as evidenced by the "Extrajudicial Settlement and Sale" document itself.
*   **Registration of Deed:** The registration of the "Extrajudicial Settlement and Sale" under Act No. 3344 (governing unregistered lands) instead of Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act, governing registered lands) in 1957 did not operate as constructive notice to the other co-owners. This is a critical finding, as proper registration would have started the prescriptive period.
*   **Laches and Prescription of Action:** The defenses of laches and prescription were rejected because the respondents were in possession of the property and only learned of the sale in 1996, when the petitioner put up the security fence and relocated families. The Court reiterated the jurisprudential rule that an action to quiet title does not prescribe when the plaintiff is in possession.
*   **Legal Redemption:** The SC upheld the right of legal redemption under Article 1088 of the Civil Code. The other co-heirs can redeem the sold share by reimbursing the purchaser (MCIAA) for the *price of the sale*. The one-month period for redemption has not lapsed because the heirs of Tito Dignos never provided written notice of the sale to the other co-heirs.
*   **Redemption Price:** The redemption price is based on the original purchase price paid by the CAA in 1957, not the current market value.
*   **Warranty:** The SC noted that the "Extrajudicial Settlement and Sale" contains a warranty clause. This allows MCIAA to pursue claims against the heirs of Tito Dignos for any disturbance in its possession.

**Obligations:**

*   **MCIAA:** Obligated to reconvey the ¾ shares in Lot Nos. 2296 and 2316 to the respondents.
*   **Respondents:** Obligated to pay MCIAA P640.00 (¼ of the original purchase price) for the redemption of the Tito Dignos share.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Heirs of Tito Dignos:** Potentially liable to MCIAA for breach of warranty due to the partial failure of title.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Disputes regarding the exact boundaries and areas of the co-owned shares after partition.** A formal survey and partition of the properties may be necessary to avoid future disputes.
*   **Litigation Costs:** While the respondents prevailed, further litigation may arise during the partition process.
*   **Valuation Disputes:** Despite the court's ruling, disputes regarding the valuation of improvements made by MCIAA on the property during the partition may arise.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code, Articles 493, 1088, 1620, and 1623.
*   Act No. 3344.
*   Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The fact that the original titles were allegedly lost during WWII and were never reconstituted may be a source of future problems and will require diligent effort to reconstruct.

**Case Law:**

*   *Bailon-Casilao v. CA* (G.R. No. 78178, April 15, 1988, 160 SCRA 738).
*   *Punsalan v. Boon Liat* (44 Phil. 320 (1923)).
*   *Ramirez v. Bautista* (14 Phil. 528 (1909)).
*   *Mainit v. Bandoy* (14 Phil. 730 (1910)).

**Conclusion:**

The SC upheld the principle of co-ownership and the right of legal redemption. MCIAA's claim of ownership through acquisitive prescription failed. The respondents can redeem the Tito Dignos share at the original purchase price. MCIAA may pursue a claim against the heirs of Tito Dignos for breach of warranty. This decision may be without prejudice to a complaint of MCIAA to the HEIRS of Tito Dignos and their successors-in-interest.
