**Case:** *Career Executive Service Board (CESB) v. Commission on Audit (COA)*, G.R. No. 212348, June 19, 2018.

**Summary:**
The Supreme Court ruled on a petition filed by the CESB challenging a COA decision that affirmed the disallowance of monetary benefits granted to CESB employees from agency savings pursuant to a Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Disallowance by COA of monetary benefits (fringe benefits, rice subsidy, birthday cash gift, christmas grocery, loyalty award, retirement benefit and funeral assistance) granted by CESB to its employees in CY 2002 and 2003, paid out of savings based on Section 2, Article V of the CNA with SANDIGAN (employee organization).
*   **COA's Argument:** The COA disallowed the payments based on:
    *   Benefits were not subject to negotiation under E.O. 180 and its IRR.
    *   CESB lacked the legal authority to use savings for CNA benefits.
*   **CESB's Argument:** The CESB argues that National Budget Circular 487 (implementing R.A. 9206, the General Appropriations Act of 2003) authorized the use of savings for CNA incentives and that these benefits fell under the exception outlined in Section 12 of R.A. No. 6758 (Salary Standardization Law).

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court upheld the COA's disallowance.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   The DBM did not determine the benefits and incentives, making standardization not automatic.
    *   Executive Order 180 and IRR prohibit negotiation for benefits needing appropriation, such as those given in this case.
    *   CESB lacked the constitutional and statutory authority to augment appropriations from savings, a power reserved for specific officials listed in the Constitution.
*   **Modified Ruling:** Court held that the officials who authorized the payment and employees receiving the benefits *were not* required to reimburse the disallowed amounts due to good faith, relying on *De Jesus v. COA*. The court cited that the lack of prior jurisprudence prohibiting the specific benefits, coupled with a good-faith belief in the legality of the payments under the CNA and the DBM circular, mitigated against holding the individuals personally liable.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Primary Liability:** The Court did not determine who was primarily liable. The decision focused on whether good faith exempted the individuals from reimbursement liability. If primary liability was determined, those who authorized the payment would be the liable persons.
*   **Recipients:** Normally, recipients are liable for disallowed benefits; however, this case granted them exemption due to good faith, based on the factors outlined in *PEZA v. COA* (honesty of intention, absence of knowledge of circumstances that should put one on inquiry, no prior jurisprudence).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Good Faith Reliance:** The application of "good faith" relies heavily on the specific circumstances and the absence of prior warnings or jurisprudence. Future similar situations may be evaluated differently if the guidelines are more clearly defined.
*   **CNA Negotiation Limits:** This case reinforces the limited scope of negotiable items under E.O. 180 and its IRR, particularly those requiring appropriations. This creates risk for future CNAs that include similar types of monetary benefits.
*   **DBM Circular vs. Statutory Authority:** The ruling underscores that DBM circulars cannot override the express limitations on the augmentation of appropriations as outlined in the Constitution and applicable statutes.
*   **Ambiguity:** There is no clear outline for the extent of fiscal autonomy that CESB exercises. As they are still attached to the CSC, they do not have the power to authorize the augmentation of items of its appropriations from savings in other items of its appropriations.
