**Summary of *Gonzales-Saldana v. Niamatali*, G.R. No. 226587, November 21, 2018**

**Core Issue:** Recovery of a sum of money (₱3,000,000.00) remitted by Respondents (Niamatali spouses) to Petitioner (Gonzales-Saldana) for the purchase of a property in Las Piñas. The intended purchase failed, and Petitioner used the funds to acquire properties in Manila and Parañaque without Respondents' explicit consent.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Implied Agency:** The Court found an implied agency relationship existed between the Respondents (principals) and the Petitioner (agent) specifically for the purchase of the Las Piñas property.
    *   **Reference:** Article 1868, Civil Code.
*   **Breach of Agency:** Petitioner acted *ultra vires* by purchasing different properties (Manila and Parañaque) without the prior approval of the principals, exceeding her authority.
*   **Restitution:** Petitioner is obligated to return the ₱3,000,000.00 due to the failed intended purchase and her unauthorized actions, stemming from breach of agency.
*   **Compensatory Interest:**  Compensatory interest at 6% per annum is imposed from the date of filing of the complaint (March 6, 2006) until finality, and another 6% per annum from finality until full satisfaction. This is based on Article 2209 of the Civil Code.
    *   **Reference:** *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 304 Phil. 236 (1994) as reiterated in *Nacar v. Gallery Frames*, 716 Phil. 267 (2013)

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner is liable to pay Respondents the principal amount of ₱3,000,000.00 plus compensatory interest.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Judicial Admission:** The CA (and ultimately the Supreme Court) heavily relied on admissions made by Petitioner in her Answer.  Petitioner argued that these were not admissions but defenses. The court rejected this argument.
    *   **Statutory Reference:** Rule 129, Section 4 of the Rules of Court (regarding judicial admissions).
*   **Unjust Enrichment:**  While the CA mentioned unjust enrichment, the Supreme Court anchored the decision primarily on breach of agency and the resultant obligation to return the funds.
    * The Supreme Court emphasized that the obligation to return the money is a consequence of her failure to comply with her principal obligation.
*   **Interest Calculation:** The application of *Eastern Shipping Lines* and *Nacar v. Gallery Frames* fixes the interest rate.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals***:  Established rules on the imposition of legal interest, clarifying monetary vs. compensatory interest.  Cited for the specific application of 6% interest *per annum* in the absence of stipulated rates, applicable to damages for breach of contract.
*   ***Nacar v. Gallery Frames***: Reiteration of the rules on legal interest as laid down in *Eastern Shipping Lines*.
*   ***Siga-an v. Villanueva***: Differentiates monetary interest and compensatory interest.
*   ***Alfelor v. Halasan***: Defines Judicial Admission

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, albeit with a modification on the interest calculation's starting point. The Petitioner's arguments were deemed unpersuasive due to her judicial admissions and the established breach of agency.
