## Legal Document Summary: *Corpus v. Pamular* (G.R. No. 186403, September 05, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing the RTC's order granting the prosecution's motion to amend the Information for murder against Samonte to include Corpus as a co-accused and directing the issuance of a warrant of arrest against Corpus.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Amendment of Information:**
    *   **Rule 110, Section 14, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure (ROC):** Governs amendment or substitution of complaints or information. Before plea, amendment is allowed; after plea, only formal amendments not prejudicial to the accused are allowed.
    *   The Supreme Court held that alleging conspiracy when not previously included is a formal amendment if it doesn't change the basic theory of the prosecution (citing *People v. Court of Appeals*, 206 Phil. 637 (1983)).
    *   **Contentious Clause:** Whether adding a conspiracy charge against Samonte after his arraignment is a prejudicial *substantial* amendment (as petitioners contend, citing *People v. Montenegro*, 242 Phil. 655 (1988)) or a permissible *formal* amendment.
    *   **Risk:** Exposure of Samonte to greater liability through the "act of one is the act of all" doctrine if conspiracy is proven.
*   **Probable Cause & Warrant of Arrest:**
    *   **Article III, Section 2, 1987 Constitution:** No warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined *personally* by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation.
    *   **Rule 112, Section 6, ROC:**  Judge must personally evaluate the prosecutor's resolution and supporting evidence. May dismiss if evidence clearly fails to establish probable cause.
    *   Petitioners allege the judge failed to personally determine probable cause, relying solely on the prosecutor's resolution.
    *   **Case Law:**  Cites *Soliven v. Makasiar*, 249 Phil. 394 (1988) regarding the judge's duty to personally determine probable cause but not necessarily personally examine witnesses. Also *Lim v. Felix*, 272 Phil. 122 (1991), highlighting the need for the judge to have a basis for personal determination.
    *   **Risk:**  Unlawful arrest and detention of Corpus if probable cause was not properly determined.
*   **Suspension of Arraignment:**
    *   **Rule 116, Section 11(c), ROC:** Arraignment shall be suspended if a petition for review of the prosecutor's resolution is pending at the DOJ, for a maximum of 60 days.
    *   Petitioners argue the RTC should have suspended proceedings (including warrant execution) pending DOJ review, citing *Ledesma v. Court of Appeals*, 344 Phil. 207 (1997) and *Tolentino v. Bonifacio*, 223 Phil. 558 (1985).
    *   **Risk:**  Premature arraignment and trial of Corpus before final resolution by the DOJ.
*   **Procedural Issue:**
    *   Failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration before filing the Petition for Certiorari (violates Rule 65).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Pamular:** Duty to personally determine probable cause before issuing the warrant, evaluate supporting documents.
*   **Prosecutor Florendo:** Duty to ensure information is properly amended in accordance with ROC.
*   **Carlito Samonte:** Criminal liability for Murder.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Whether adding the conspiracy charge against Samonte is a formal or substantial amendment.
*   The extent to which the judge "personally" determined probable cause.

**Holding:** Petition partially granted. The case is remanded to the Regional Trial Court of Guimba, Nueva Ecija for its preliminary examination of probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest and thereafter proceed to the arraignment of petitioner Amado Corpus, Jr.

**Key Takeaways:**

The SC reiterated the importance of procedural rules for the amendment of an information and the proper determination of probable cause for issuance of a warrant of arrest. However, it also clarified the distinction between executive and judicial determination of probable cause. Of note, the ruling may have been affected by a late development: an affidavit executed by Samonte implicating Corpus in ordering the killing of Angelito, and the fact that the Court is not a trier of facts, leading to a remand to the RTC for consideration of the additional evidence.
