## Legal Document Summary: *Ayson v. Spouses Paragas* (G.R. No. 146730)

**Nature of Document:** Decision by the Supreme Court affirming the Court of Appeals' decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 59645, which upheld the RTC's declaration that a Deed of Absolute Sale was an equitable mortgage and ordered reconveyance.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Equitable Mortgage:** The core holding is that the 1955 Deed of Absolute Sale between Spouses Paragas and Blas F. Rayos and Amado Ll. Ayson is deemed an equitable mortgage under Articles 1602 and 1604 of the Civil Code due to Spouses Paragas remaining in possession, the circumstances surrounding the agreement (threat of prosecution due to Felix Paragas's defalcation), and subsequent payments exceeding the initial debt. This is despite the deed's explicit nature as a sale.
*   **Nullification of TCTs:** The court upheld the annulment of Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) No. 57684 (Amado Ll. Ayson) and No. 59036 (Amado Z. Ayson) derived from the flawed deed, except as it affects the interest of Spouses Delfin and Gloria Alog, who were deemed innocent purchasers for value.
*   **Reconveyance:** Amado Z. Ayson is ordered to reconvey the property covered by TCT No. 59036 to Spouses Paragas.
*   **Damages:** Amado Z. Ayson and the estate of Blas F. Rayos are jointly and severally liable for the amount paid by Spouses Delfin and Gloria Alog to the late Blas F. Rayos, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P10,000.00 as attorney's fees.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Amado Z. Ayson:** Obligated to reconvey the property and is jointly and severally liable for financial damages alongside the Estate of Blas F. Rayos.
*   **Estate of Blas F. Rayos:** Jointly and severally liable for the financial damages.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Impact on Spouses Alog:** While the decision protects the interests of the spouses Alog, it's unclear if the Spouses Paragas will receive financial compensation on that account.
*   **Valuation of Damages:**The Court order the Estate of Blas F. Rayos and Ayson to pay the Spouses Paragas for the value of the land. The value is ambiguous here because the current market value of the property is subject to change.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Articles 1602 & 1604:** Core statutory basis for the determination of the deed as an equitable mortgage.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1391:** Defines the prescriptive period for annulment of voidable contracts.
*   ***Spouses Malison v. Court of Appeals***:  Cited regarding the limited effect of an ejectment judgment on ownership.
*   ***Macapinlac v. Gutierrez Repide***: Cited regarding the admissibility of parol evidence in determining whether an instrument was in truth and in fact given merely as a security for the repayment of a loan
*   ***Tolentino, A.M., Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Civil Code of the Philippines, Vol. V (1992)***: Cited regarding enforcing the agreement or understanding in regards to the intent of the parties at the time the contract was executed
*   ***Roman Catholic Archbishop of Caceres v. Heirs of Manuel Abella***: Cited regarding the right of possession being a necessary incident of ownership.

**Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Prescription & Laches:** The petitioner argued prescription and laches, claiming the action to annul the deed was filed too late. The Court rejected this, citing the continuing undue influence exerted upon the respondents and the fact that the defect in consent never ceased up to the time of the signing of the Affidavit on April 8, 1992.
*   **Judicial Admissions:** Petitioner argued the respondents were bound by their admissions in the ejectment case. The Court clarified that the ejectment judgment only concerned physical possession and did not bar a separate action for ownership.
*   **Good Faith Purchaser:** Petitioner claimed he was a good faith purchaser. The Court implicitly rejected this, emphasizing the inherent flaw in the title chain stemming from the equitable mortgage.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court sided with the respondents, Spouses Paragas, finding that the Deed of Absolute Sale was in reality an equitable mortgage. The ruling emphasizes the Court's willingness to look beyond the surface of contracts and consider the true intent of the parties, especially when circumstances suggest unequal bargaining power and potential coercion. The decision highlights the importance of possession as an indicator of true ownership and underscores the limited effect of an ejectment judgment on ownership claims. The petitioner bears the burden of reconveying the land and compensating the respondents.
