## Legal Document Summary: *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Kumassie Plantation Co., Inc.*

**Case:** G.R. No. 177404 & G.R. No. 178097 (Consolidated)

**Court:** Supreme Court, Special Third Division

**Date:** December 4, 2009 (Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration)

**Parties:** Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) v. Kumassie Plantation Company Incorporated (KPCI) & Secretary of DAR

**Subject Matter:** Just compensation for KPCI's land compulsorily acquired under agrarian reform.

**Prior History:**

*   RTC initially valued the land at P100,000/hectare.
*   Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision.
*   Supreme Court initially reversed CA, approving LBP's valuation of P41,792.94/hectare (based on DAR AO No. 6, Series of 1992).

**Motion for Reconsideration:** KPCI argued that the DAR valuation formula should not be binding on courts and that LBP's computation was flawed by excluding cacao production.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Judicial Determination of Just Compensation:** While just compensation is a judicial function, courts *must* adhere to the factors in Section 17 of RA 6657 and the formula in DAR AO No. 6, Series of 1992 (as amended), which have the force and effect of law. Citing *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Banal* and *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada*.
*   **Erroneous Exclusion of Cacao Production:** The Supreme Court found merit in KPCI's argument that LBP erred by not including cacao production in its Capitalized Net Income (CNI) calculation. LBP's justification of "no production data available" was deemed insufficient given its mandate and access to industry data sources according to Items B.1 and B.2 of DAO No. 6.
*   **Inclusion of Lessee-Planted Crops:** DAO No. 6 does not differentiate between crops planted by the landowner and those planted by a lessee (Philippine Cocoa Estates Corporation - PCEC) when calculating the CNI. The court held that all crops contributing to net income should be considered.
*   **Relevance of LBP Internal Memorandum:** A previously unpresented LBP Memorandum dated July 25, 2000, approving upward adjustment to include "2% Cacao Gross Sale," was considered despite not being formally offered as evidence because: (a) It was issued after the RTC trial; (b) it indicated a prior LBP acknowledgment of the cacao component; and (c) it corroborated the court's finding of LBP's erroneous exclusion of cacao production.
*   **Remand to RTC:** Due to insufficient evidence to definitively calculate just compensation, the case was remanded to the RTC to re-compute based on DAO No. 6, Series of 1992 (as amended), including cacao production. Citing *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Lim*.
*   **Cacao Tree Ownership Dispute:** The issue of ownership and compensation for the cacao trees planted by PCEC is a contractual matter outside the jurisdiction of the Special Agrarian Court and should be resolved separately between KPCI and PCEC.

**Obligations:**

*   **LBP:** To provide accurate and complete valuation data, including verifiable data for cacao production per DAO No. 6.
*   **RTC:** To determine just compensation based on RA 6657, DAO No. 6, and the inclusion of cacao production.

**Potential Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **LBP:** Potential underpayment of just compensation, leading to further litigation and possible constitutional challenges.
*   **KPCI:** Risk that the re-computed just compensation may not significantly increase or fully reflect the value of its land.
*   **PCEC:** Risk that a separate legal claim against KPCI for value of Cacao trees will be unsuccessful.

**Statutory & Regulatory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law) - Section 17: Factors for just compensation.
*   DAR Administrative Order No. 6, Series of 1992 (as amended by DAO No. 11, Series of 1994): Valuation Formula.

**Contentious Clauses & Ambiguities:**

*   The exact method LBP used in its Memorandum dated July 25, 2000, in calculating additional payment of P8,116,919.09 is ambiguous.
*   The ultimate valuation of the cacao production in accordance with industry data (Item B.1 of DAO No. 6) may lead to disagreement.

**Case Law Relied Upon:**

*   *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Banal,* 478 Phil. 701 (2004): Judicial discretion in just compensation must be exercised within the bounds of law.
*   *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada,* G.R. No. 164876, 23 January 2006, 479 SCRA 495, 507: DAR AO partakes the nature of law, unless invalidated.
*   *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Lim,* G.R. No. 171941, 2 August 2007, 529 SCRA 129: Courts must adhere to DAO No. 6; cases may be remanded for proper computation.

**Outcome:** The Motion for Reconsideration was *partially granted*. The case was remanded to the RTC for re-computation of just compensation, explicitly including the land's cacao production, using the formula in DAO No. 6. The issue of cacao tree ownership between KPCI and PCEC remains a separate matter for resolution in appropriate proceedings.
