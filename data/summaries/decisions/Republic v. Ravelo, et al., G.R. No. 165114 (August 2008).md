## Legal Document Summary: Republic vs. Ravelo, et al. (G.R. No. 165114)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking cancellation of title and reversion of real property granted under a sales patent.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in declaring the Redondos as innocent purchasers in good faith, thus upholding the validity of their title despite alleged fraud in the original grant of the sales patent to Ravelo.

**Facts:**

*   Ravelo was granted Sales Patent No. 12458 and OCT No. P-4517 for Lot No. 16.
*   The Republic filed a complaint for cancellation of title, alleging violation of DENR Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 20 (improper venue for application) and fraud (misrepresentation regarding occupancy and public domain status) by Ravelo.
*   A notice of *lis pendens* was inscribed on Ravelo's title.
*   Prior to the *lis pendens*, Antonio Chieng obtained a judgment against Ravelo and acquired the property through an execution sale, registering a Notice of Levy and Certificate of Sale.
*   Wilson Chieng, Antonio's son, acquired the title through a deed of sale.
*   The Redondos purchased the property from Wilson Chieng. Deeds of sale were executed before and after TCT transfer to Chieng and registration of *lis pendens*.

**Trial Court:** Ruled in favor of the Republic, cancelling all titles and ordering reversion based on fraud and violation of C.A. No. 141 (Public Land Act) regarding restrictions on alienation within ten years of the patent grant. It deemed Redondos not to be in good faith as they didn't check RTC records regarding existing cases.

**Court of Appeals:** Reversed, declaring the Redondos innocent purchasers in good faith, holding that the sale was perfected before the *lis pendens* and that they verified the title. Even if Raveloâ€™s title was tainted with fraud, the appellate court believed it could be the source of a valid title to an innocent purchaser for value.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** **Reversed** the Court of Appeals' decision.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 91 of CA No. 141:** False statements in a land application result in *ipso facto* cancellation of the title.
*   **Section 51 of PD No. 1529:** (Land Registration Decree) Registration is the operative act to convey registered land. Unregistered conveyances only operate as a contract between parties.
*   **Section 76 of PD No. 1529:** Provides for the *lis pendens* doctrine.

**Liabilities:**

*   Ravelo's title is void due to misrepresentation in the sales application.
*   Redondos were not innocent purchasers in good faith because:
    *   They contracted to purchase the property from Chieng *before* he even acquired title, and when Chieng acquired the title and transferred it to them the lis pendens was already in place.
    *   The notice of *lis pendens* placed them on notice of the pending litigation when they ultimately executed a deed of sale after Chieng was registered and they took their own title.
* Redondos are subject to the outcome of the reversion case.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Good Faith vs. Notice of Lis Pendens:** The core contention revolves around whether the Redondos can claim good faith despite the notice of *lis pendens*. The SC emphasizes that *lis pendens* puts subsequent purchasers on notice of the pending litigation, negating a claim of good faith.
*   **Impact of Prior Encumbrances:** The significance of the prior Notice of Levy and Certificate of Sale in favor of Chieng is crucial.  Chieng's position as an innocent purchaser at the execution sale is relevant, but does not automatically extend to the Redondos given the lis pendens.
*   **Misrepresentation in Original Application:** The SC highlights that Ravelo's failure to present evidence contesting the government's allegations of misrepresentation essentially conceded the point. This forms a strong basis for cancellation and reversion.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court held that the Redondos are not innocent purchasers in good faith because they were placed on notice of the Republic's claim due to the lis pendens. Ravelo's original title was void because of misrepresentation in the sales application, and the property must revert to the public domain. The Court places significant emphasis on the legal effect of the notice of *lis pendens* and the Redondos' failure to establish their status as innocent purchasers for value in light of this notice.
