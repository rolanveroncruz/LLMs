## Legal Document Summary: *XXX v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 268457

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmation of the RTC's conviction of Petitioner for three counts of violation of Section 10(a) of RA 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act).

**Facts:** Petitioner XXX, father of AAA (12) and BBB (10), was charged with child abuse in three separate Informations relating to incidents in 2017 and 2018.  The Informations detailed instances where XXX physically assaulted AAA and BBB, causing injuries and using abusive language.  The RTC convicted XXX, which the CA affirmed with modifications on damages. XXX appeals, claiming lack of intent to debase, degrade, or demean his children.

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 10(a) of RA 7610:**  Criminalizes acts of child abuse, cruelty, or exploitation not covered by the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Section 3(b)(2) of RA 7610:** Defines child abuse as acts or words that debase, degrade, or demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being.
*   **Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603 (Child and Youth Welfare Code):** Referenced in Sec 10(a) but not directly relevant to the core issue.
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):**  Relevant as an alternative if the specific intent for child abuse is not proven, potentially leading to charges of slight physical injuries.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied to determine the range of imprisonment.
*   **Legal Interest (6% per annum):** Imposed on damages from finality of decision until full payment.
*   **Section 31(f) of RA 7610:** Supports the CA's order for the accused to pay a fine.

**Issue:** Whether the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that XXX committed child abuse under Section 10(a) of RA 7610, specifically proving the intent to debase, degrade, or demean the children.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court **DENIED** the Petition and affirmed the CA decision. The Court held that the prosecution adequately demonstrated XXX's intent to debase, degrade, or demean his children based on:

*   The testimonies of AAA and BBB regarding the physical assaults.
*   The excessive and violent nature of the disciplinary measures employed (hitting with a nail-embedded rod, kicking, hitting with a dustpan).
*   The disproportionate relationship between the "offenses" and the punishments.
* Medical Certificates substantiating the children's physical injuries.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Conviction for three counts of child abuse.
*   **Penalties:** Indeterminate sentence of four years, nine months, and 11 days of *prision correccional* (minimum) to six years, eight months, and one day of *prision mayor* (maximum) for each count. Fine of PHP 15,000.00 for each count.
*   **Civil Liability:**  Ordered to pay AAA and BBB PHP 20,000.00 each as moral damages, PHP 20,000.00 each as exemplary damages, and PHP 20,000.00 each as temperate damages for each count of child abuse.
*   **Interest:** All monetary awards to earn 6% interest per annum from the finality of the Decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Precedent:** Reinforces the interpretation of Section 10(a) RA 7610, particularly the requirement of specific intent to debase, degrade, or demean a child and how it can be inferred from circumstances.
*   **Enforcement:**  Cancellation of bail bond and order for arrest and service of sentence.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***People v. Calaoagan*, 850 Phil. 183 (2019):**  Defines "debase," "degrade," and "demean" within the context of RA 7610.
*   ***Brinas v. People*, G.R. No. 254005, June 23, 2021:**  Emphasizes the requirement of specific intent to debase, degrade, or demean a child for conviction under RA 7610.
*   ***Bongalon v. People*, 707 Phil. 11 (2013):** Established that not all laying of hands constitutes child abuse; intent must be proven. Led to conviction for slight physical injuries.
*   ***Jabalde v. People*, 787 Phil. 255 (2016):** Similar to Bongalon; conviction for slight physical injuries.
*   ***Torres v. People*, 803 Phil. 480 (2019):** Affirmed conviction for child abuse due to excessive force, indicating specific intent.
*   ***Rosaldes v. People*, 745 Phil. 77 (2014):** Conviction for child abuse even with claim of disciplinary action; actions were unnecessary and excessive.
*   ***Talocod v. People*, 887 Phil. 793, 803 (2020) :** The Court may consider the circumstances of the case and the manner by which the offender committed the act complained of

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contention revolved around the application of the "specific intent" requirement in proving child abuse. The defense argued the acts were for discipline, while the prosecution successfully argued the force used was excessive and indicative of intent to debase.
*   The court rejected the defense's argument that filing was for support, citing XXX's existing financial support.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, finding sufficient evidence to prove the intent to debase, degrade, or demean, thereby affirming the criminal and civil liabilities of XXX under RA 7610. This case underscores the importance of proving specific intent in child abuse cases and the consequences of employing excessive force in disciplinary actions. The Supreme Court highlights that a conviction may prosper if it is established that physical injuries against a minor were done with the specific intent to debase, degrade, or demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of the child as a human being.
