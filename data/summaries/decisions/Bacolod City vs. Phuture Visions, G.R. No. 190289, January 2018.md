## Legal Document Summary: *The City of Bacolod vs. Phuture Visions Co., Inc.* (G.R. No. 190289)

**Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision reinstating Phuture Vision's (Phuture) claim for damages against the City of Bacolod (City) due to the closure of its bingo operations.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Background:** Phuture, after amending its Articles of Incorporation (AOI), obtained a provisional Grant of Authority (GOA) from PAGCOR and an Award Notice from SM Prime to operate bingo games at SM Bacolod. It applied for a Mayor's Permit but allegedly started operations before receiving the actual permit.
*   **Closure Order:** The City Legal Officer issued a Closure Order based on City Tax Ordinance No. 93-001 (operating a business without a permit) and closed Phuture's bingo outlet. The City argued that the claim slip provided to Phuture was an error and that Phuture's actual application was for a renewal of a permit for a different business at a different location.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** The RTC denied Phuture's request for a temporary mandatory order to reopen the outlet and dismissed the entire case. The CA affirmed the denial of the mandatory order (deemed moot) but reversed the dismissal of the damages claim, remanding it to the RTC for further proceedings.
*   **Issue:** Can the City and its officials be held liable for damages related to the closure of Phuture's bingo operations?
*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) granted the City's petition, annulling the CA decision and reinstating the RTC decision. The SC held that the City cannot be sued without its consent, as enshrined in the Constitution (Art. XVI, Sec. 3).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The main question is whether Phuture can claim damages from the city of Bacolod and whether the actions were legally authorized by the city ordinances.
*   There is the question of the claim ticket that was issued by the office of the Mayor.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Immunity from Suit:** The most significant issue is the City's immunity from suit. The SC held that issuing business permits is a governmental function, not a proprietary one. Therefore, the City's consent to be sued cannot be implied from the power to issue permits. This is crucial for all government entities.
*   **Lack of Cause of Action:** The Court, citing Justice Barreda in *Insurance Co. of North America v. Osaka Shosen Kaisha*, emphasized that a suit against the state without consent inherently fails to state a cause of action. This can be raised at any stage, even on appeal.
*   **Damnum Absque Injuria:** The SC found that Phuture had no clear legal right to operate bingo games at the time of the closure. Therefore, even if Phuture suffered damages, it was *damnum absque injuria* (damage without legal injury), for which no legal remedy exists.
*   **Unclear Right to Operate** The court noted that the amendment to Phuture's AOI was amended to reflect bingo operations on February 14, 2007 or more than a month after it had supposedly applied for a license for bingo operations with the Office of the Mayor.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "claim slip" issued to Phuture was contentious. The City claimed it was an error, while Phuture argued it evidenced a valid application.
*   The exact nature of Phuture's application, and whether it clearly indicated an intent to operate bingo games at SM Bacolod, was disputed.

**Legal Precision and Advice:**

This case reinforces the principle of state immunity from suit, even when a local government unit has been conferred with corporate powers. It highlights that activities conducted under police power (such as issuing permits) do not constitute a waiver of immunity. Any claim for damages against the City must demonstrate the City's explicit consent to be sued. The case also emphasizes the importance of demonstrating a clear legal right before claiming damages for alleged wrongful actions by the government. Further research and analysis would be needed to examine the validity of the Local Tax Ordinance to see whether it contains provisions for closure. Finally, analysis of the requirements of the AOI of a corporation is needed to see whether failure to follow those procedures could give cause for suit.
