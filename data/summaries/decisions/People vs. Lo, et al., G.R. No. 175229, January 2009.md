## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Lo, Calimon, and Comila*

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Lourdes Lo, Grace Calimon, and Aida Comila* (G.R. No. 175229, January 29, 2009)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modifications the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale (RA 8042, Sec. 6 & 7) and Estafa (RPC, Art. 315, par. 2(a)).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Illegal Recruitment:** Accused Lo, Calimon, and Comila recruited Magnaye, Agramon, and Devanadera for overseas employment in Italy, collecting placement fees without the required license or authority from the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE)/POEA.
*   **Estafa:**  Accused misrepresented their ability to secure overseas jobs, inducing complainants to pay placement/processing fees with no intention of deployment, resulting in financial loss.
*   **Accused Lo:** Still at large, not part of the current appeal.
*   **Accused Calimon:** Represented herself as a sub-agent of a legitimate recruitment agency (AISC), confirmed by someone over the phone when Devanadera verified it. Received payments and processed documents.
*   **Accused Comila:** Allegedly introduced to Devanadera by Calimon; showed her the complainantsâ€™ files and informed her of the need to secure a visa from the Italian Embassy.
*   **POEA Certification:**  Calimon and Comila were not licensed or authorized to recruit.
*   **Conviction:** RTC convicted Calimon of illegal recruitment in large scale and estafa (multiple counts). Comila was convicted of simple illegal recruitment and one count of estafa.
*   **CA Modification:** Affirmed Calimon's illegal recruitment conviction but modified the fine to P1,000,000. Adjusted penalties for estafa to match amounts defrauded. Held Calimon and Comila jointly and severally liable to indemnify one of the complainants, Devanadera, for the damages she caused to her.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Calimon:** Liable for life imprisonment and a fine of P1,000,000 for illegal recruitment in large scale. Liable for estafa, with penalties varying depending on the amount defrauded (prision correccional to prision mayor). Liable for reparation to Magnaye (P35,000) and jointly and severally with Comila to Devanadera (P17,500) and Agramon (P10,000) for damages.
*   **Comila:** Liable for imprisonment (8-10 years) and a fine of P300,000 for simple illegal recruitment. Liable for estafa, with a penalty dependent on the amount defrauded.  Jointly and severally liable with Calimon to indemnify Devanadera (P17,500) and Agramon (P10,000).

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Testimonial Evidence:** Conviction relies heavily on the credibility of the private complainants' testimonies.
*   **Conspiracy:** The Information did not allege conspiracy between Calimon and Comila for the Illegal Recruitment charge; thus, Comila was only convicted for simple Illegal Recruitment.
*   **Mitigating/Aggravating Circumstances:**  The penalty for estafa varied according to whether modifying circumstances were present. Any overlooked evidence of these could impact sentencing.
*  **AIDA COMILA was acquitted by the RTC in Criminal Case No. 00-180521, and in view of her acquittal by the RTC, this matter can no longer be questioned in this appeal on the ground of double jeopardy
