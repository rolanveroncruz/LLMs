## Legal Document Summary: People v. Hernando, G.R. No. 186493 (2009)

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Reynaldo Hernando y Aquino

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming RTC conviction for Murder (Article 248, Revised Penal Code).

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Conviction Upheld:** The Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Reynaldo Hernando for the murder of Victoria Sturch.
*   **Positive Identification:** Key evidence was the positive identification of the accused by two eyewitnesses (Dirige and David). The court applied the "totality of circumstances" test, referring to *People v. Teehankee, Jr.*, finding the out-of-court identification reliable due to proximity, clarity of view, and lack of suggestion by police.
*   **Independent In-Court Identification:** The court stressed that even if the out-of-court identification was flawed, the independent in-court identification by the witnesses cured any defects, citing *People v. Rivera*. This established identity beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Defense of Alibi Rejected:** The defense of alibi was rejected, as the accused failed to prove it was physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene. The court noted the travel time from Pangasinan to Baguio.
*   **Rejection of Alternate Perpetrator Theory:** Testimony attempting to implicate other individuals (Robbie Imperial and Eddie Boy Padilla) was deemed circumstantial and insufficient to exonerate the accused.
*   **Treachery:** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' finding of treachery, qualifying the killing as murder. The victim was shot from behind, ensuring execution without risk to the accused.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua imposed, consistent with Article 248 and Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code as there were no aggravating or mitigating circumstances.
*   **Damages:**
    *   **Civil Indemnity:** P50,000.00 (no proof required beyond fact of death and responsibility, consistent with jurisprudence).
    *   **Moral Damages:** P50,000.00 (granted due to violent death, no proof of suffering required).
    *   **Actual Damages:** Modified from P208,000 to P100,000, based only on receipted expenses for funeral services.
    *   **Exemplary Damages:** P30,000.00 awarded due to the presence of treachery, citing *Esqueda v. People*.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant:**  Serves Reclusion Perpetua; pays civil indemnity, moral damages, actual damages, and exemplary damages to the heirs of the victim.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Eyewitness Identification:** While the court found the eyewitness identification convincing, challenges to eyewitness testimony are always a risk, especially regarding initial descriptions and potential suggestiveness during the identification process. Future appeals may hinge on re-examining these aspects.
*   **Alibi:** Defense attorneys should always be prepared to present irrefutable evidence supporting an alibi, ideally with corroborating evidence that eliminates any possibility of presence at the scene.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence for Alternate Suspects:** The court found the offered testimony about alternative suspects to be insufficient, showing the high bar for presenting an effective alternative theory.
