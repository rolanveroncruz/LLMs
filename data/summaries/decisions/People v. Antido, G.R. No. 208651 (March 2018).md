## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Antido* G.R. No. 208651

**Document Type:** Resolution of the Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court (SC) reconsiders and sets aside its earlier resolution affirming the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision finding Romeo Antido guilty of rape. The accused-appellant, Romeo Antido, died before the SC's initial resolution was promulgated.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Extinguishment of Criminal Liability:** Death of the accused pending appeal (before final conviction) extinguishes criminal liability, as mandated by Article 89(1) of the Revised Penal Code. This aligns with the doctrine articulated in *People v. Culas* (G.R. No. 211166, June 5, 2017).
*   **Extinguishment of Civil Liability *Ex Delicto*:**  The civil liability arising *solely* from the crime (civil liability *ex delicto* in *senso strictiore*) is also extinguished. *People v. Culas*.
*   **Survival of Civil Liability Based on Other Sources:** Civil liability may survive if it stems from sources other than the criminal act itself (e.g., quasi-delict, contract).  Article 1157 of the Civil Code outlines these alternative sources of obligation.
*   **Right to File Separate Civil Action:** The private offended party may pursue a separate civil action against the estate of the accused if the civil liability has another source apart from the delict. Rule 111 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure. Statute of limitations is deemed interrupted during the pendency of the criminal case. Article 1155, Civil Code.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Criminal Prosecution:**  The State loses the ability to prosecute the accused for the crime.
*   **Loss of Civil Claim *Ex Delicto*:** The victim loses the ability to recover damages predicated solely on the criminal conviction.
*   **Risk of Failing to Pursue Alternative Civil Remedies:** The victim must timely file a separate civil action based on other potential sources of obligation (e.g., Art. 2176, Civil Code - Quasi Delict) to recover damages. Failure to do so may be barred by the statute of limitations.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 89(1), Revised Penal Code:** Extinguishment of criminal liability by death.
*   **Article 1157, Civil Code:** Sources of obligations.
*   **Article 1155, Civil Code:** Interruption of prescriptive period.
*   **Rule 111, 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Civil action separate from criminal action
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 7610:** Protection against child abuse.
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 9262:** Violence against women and children.
*   **People v. Culas, G.R. No. 211166, June 5, 2017:** Clarifies the effects of the death of an accused pending appeal on liabilities.
*   **People v. Layag, G.R. No. 214875, October 17, 2016, 806 SCRA 190, 195-196.**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The resolution does not delve into the *potential* sources of civil liability beyond the crime of rape itself.  This creates uncertainty for the victim, who must now prove a separate cause of action (e.g., quasi-delict based on negligence).
*   The resolution mentions RA 7610 and RA 9262 relating to violence against women and children, but the facts and arguments pertaining to the conviction are not discussed.

**Conclusion:**

The SC correctly applied established jurisprudence regarding the extinguishment of criminal liability due to the death of the accused. However, the victim's right to recover damages hinges on the existence of a separate cause of action and the timely filing of a civil suit against the estate. Legal counsel should advise the victim to promptly assess and pursue these alternative avenues for redress.
