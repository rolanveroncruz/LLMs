## Legal Document Summary: Muller vs. PNB (G.R. No. 215922)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which reversed the RTC and reinstated with modification the MTCC decision in an ejectment case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Ejectment:** PNB sought to eject the Mullers from properties they occupied after the expiration of a lease agreement.
*   **Rental Arrears:** PNB claimed rental arrears from June 1984 up to August 2007, when the Mullers vacated the premises.
*   **Demands to Vacate:** PNB sent multiple demands to vacate, including one on March 17, 1988, and a final demand on July 17, 2006.
*   **Rental Rate:** Contention over the appropriate rental rate and whether the MTCC could take judicial notice of it. MTCC awarded rent at PHP 2,000 then 2,500. RTC reduced it to PHP 1,000. CA reinstated MTCC's decision.
*   **Interest:** The CA ordered the Mullers to pay interest at 6% per annum from the initial demand (May 26, 1987) until finality, and 12% thereafter. The Supreme Court modified this to 6% after finality of the decision citing Nacar v. Gallery Frames.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Mullers:** Obligation to pay rent from the time of the initial demand for payment of rental arrears, not just the latest demand to vacate.
*   **Mullers:** Liability for interest on unpaid rentals.
*   **PNB:** Obligation to allow the Mullers to occupy the premises provided rent is paid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Prescription:** The Mullers argued that PNB's claim for rentals had prescribed. The Court found that the claim had not prescribed because the parties continued lease agreement even after written expiration of the lease..
*   **Damages:** Whether the damages are merely incidental to the illegal occupation of the property.
*   **Judicial Notice:** The RTC erred in reversing the MTCC findings.
*   **Interest Rate:** The legal interest rate after finality of the judgment needs to be updated to be in line with current jurisprudence (6% per annum per *Nacar v. Gallery Frames*).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 1144 & 1145:** Cited by the Mullers regarding prescription of actions based on written and oral contracts, respectively.
*   **Civil Code Articles 19 & 20:** Cited by court as reason for ruling that Mullers cannot be allowed to use PNB's property without payment of compensation.
*   **Civil Code Article 1670:** Deals with implied new lease.
*   **Rule 70, Section 17 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Pertains to damages recoverable in ejectment cases (rent, fair rental value, or reasonable compensation).
*   **Araos v. Court of Appeals:** Cites this case for proposition that damages recoverable in unlawful detainer cases, are the rentals or fair rental value.
*   **Spouses Catungal v. Hao:** This case was cited for ruling that the plaintiff in an ejectment case is entitled to damages caused by his loss of the use and possession of the premises.
*   **Mapua v. Suburban Theaters, Inc.:** Relates to amount demandable and recoverable from a defendant in ejectment proceedings.
*   **Nacar v. Gallery Frames:** Case cited for purposes of interest rates after finality of judgment.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** The primary area of contention revolved around the date from which rental arrears should be calculated and the applicability of prescription. The factual determination of a fair rental value remained contentious, with different courts arriving at different figures.
