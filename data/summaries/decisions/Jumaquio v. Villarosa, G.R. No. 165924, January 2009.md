Here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court decision, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Resty Jumaquio v. Hon. Joselito C. Villarosa*, G.R. No. 165924, January 19, 2009.

**Subject Matter:**  Appeal from Regional Trial Court (RTC) denial of a motion to quash Informations for Grave Threats and Physical Injuries in relation to R.A. No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Informations:** Two Informations were filed against Petitioner:
    *   **Crim. Case No. SJC-78-04:** Grave Threats in relation to R.A. 7610, based on verbal threats against a 13-year-old.
    *   **Crim. Case No. SJC-79-04:** Physical Injuries in relation to R.A. 7610, based on physical assault of a 13-year-old and a 17-year-old.
*   **R.A. 7610, Section 10(a):**  The prosecution argues the acts constitute child abuse punishable under this section (other acts of neglect, abuse, cruelty, or exploitation).
*   **R.A. 7610, Section 3(b):** Defines "child abuse" as maltreatment, whether habitual or not, including psychological and physical abuse, cruelty, emotional maltreatment, or any act by deeds or words which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being

**Petitioner's Arguments:**

*   Duplicity of charges (Grave Threats *and* Violation of R.A. 7610, and Physical Injuries *and* Violation of R.A. 7610) should have been quashed per Rule 117, Section 3(e) of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure.
*   Grave Threats in relation to R.A. 7610 is not a crime.
*   The separate crimes could not even be complexed, as neither may be considered to fall within the ambit of Section 10, R.A. No. 7610.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   Petition dismissed on procedural and substantive grounds.
*   **Procedural Issues:**
    *   Violation of the hierarchy of courts; Petition for Certiorari should have been filed with the Court of Appeals (CA) first.
    *   Remedy after denial of a motion to quash is trial, not certiorari.
*   **Substantive Issues:**
    *   The Informations charge separate offenses of child abuse under R.A. 7610.
    *   The crime designated in the information is not controlling; the factual allegations control. *Malto v. People, G.R. No. 164733, September 21, 2007, 533 SCRA 643, 657.*
    *   Information is not duplicitous if it charges several related acts that constitute a single offense *People v. Lava, 138 Phil. 77, 110 (1969).*

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner is potentially liable under R.A. 7610, Section 10(a) for child abuse.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The information in Criminal Case No. SJC-79-04 alleges child abuse against two different children; however, the Court does not rule on this since petitioner did not raise it as an issue.
*   *Ambiguity*: Could be argued the specific acts charged in the information do not constitute child abuse under RA 7610 (particularly Section 10a)

**Statutory References:**

*   R.A. No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act)
*   Rule 117, Section 3(e) of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure

**Strategic Considerations:**

The Petitioner's options are limited given the SC decision. However, if the information lists that the "above acts" are the actions that "debases, degrades, and demeans the dignity of the complainant and impairs his normal growth and development" and fails to specify how the action does that, he has a better chance that it is ambiguous and vague and open to interpretation.
