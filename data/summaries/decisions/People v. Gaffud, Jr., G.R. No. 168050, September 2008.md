**Case Summary: People v. Gaffud, Jr., G.R. No. 168050 (2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Bernardino Gaffud, Jr. for the complex crime of double murder. The CA sentenced Gaffud to death.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Crime Charged:** Double murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), alleging conspiracy.
*   **Facts:** Gaffud was convicted of killing Manuel Salvador and his daughter Analyn by burning their house. An eyewitness identified Gaffud as one of the arsonists.
*   **Evidence:** Prosecution presented circumstantial evidence: Gaffud was near the scene before the crime, seen fleeing the burning house with others, and had a potential motive (prior dispute with the victims and debt). The defense presented alibi, which was rejected by the courts.
*   **Conspiracy:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA ruling that proof of conspiracy was not essential for conviction because Gaffud's direct participation was established by circumstantial evidence.  *Relevant Case Law:* *People v. Agda et al., 197 Phil. 306 (1982)*; *People v. Taaca et al., G.R. No. 35652 (1989)*.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence Sufficiency:**  The SC upheld the CA's finding that the circumstantial evidence met the requirements for conviction, as established in *Rule 133, Sec. 5 of the Rules of Court*.
*   **Complex Crime vs. Separate Counts:** SC ruled that the burning of the house, intended to kill both victims, constituted a complex crime of double murder under *Article 48 of the RPC*, not two separate murders.  *Relevant Case Law:* *People v. Guillen, 85 Phil. 307 (1950)*; *People v. Carpo et al., G.R. No. 132676 (2001)*; *People v. Comadre, G.R. No. 153559 (2004)*.
*   **Penalty:** Due to Republic Act No. 9346 (abolishing the death penalty), the SC reduced the death penalty to *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole.
*   **Damages:** Civil indemnity increased to P75,000 per victim (total P150,000). Exemplary damages of P25,000 per victim (total P50,000) were reinstated based on the aggravating circumstance of nighttime being deliberately sought.  Moral damages of P50,000 per victim were affirmed. Nominal damages of P10,000 for the burned house were also affirmed.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Accused-Appellant is liable for reclusion perpetua.
*   Accused-Appellant is liable for civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, and nominal damages as specified in the decision.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** While the SC upheld the conviction based on circumstantial evidence, these cases always carry a risk on appeal.
*   **Nighttime Aggravating Circumstance:** The Court found that the accused deliberately sought the cover of night to commit the crime but the case relies on the fact that a flashlight was used. This determination hinges on the evidence presented and the court's interpretation, which can be subject to further scrutiny.
*   **Identification of Co-Accused:** The presence of two "John Does" suggests the potential for other culpable parties.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 48, Article 248
*   Rules of Court, Rule 133, Section 5
*   Republic Act No. 9346
