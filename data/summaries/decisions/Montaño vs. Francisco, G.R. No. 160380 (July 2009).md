## Legal Document Summary: Montaño vs. Francisco, G.R. No. 160380

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari concerning the validity of tax delinquency proceedings and a subsequent auction sale of a property in Iloilo City. The Spouses Montaño, as vendees of a property under a Deed of Conditional Sale with GSIS, are challenging the legality of the sale to Rosalina Francisco due to alleged non-compliance with notice and publication requirements.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Property:** Lot 6, Block 2, Maharlika Homes, Jaro, Iloilo City, covered by TCT No. T-41681.
*   **Deed of Conditional Sale:** Spouses Montaño entered into a Deed of Conditional Sale with GSIS on April 13, 1977.
*   **Tax Delinquency & Auction Sale:** The property was sold to Respondent Francisco at a public auction on June 27, 1991, due to tax delinquency proceedings initiated by the City Treasurer's Office.
*   **Procedural Issue:** Petitioners claim lack of notice of tax delinquency and the auction sale, violating due process under Section 73 of P.D. No. 464 (Real Property Tax Code).
*   **GSIS Ownership:** At the time of the auction, GSIS was the registered owner of the property, despite the conditional sale agreement with the Montaños.
*   **Prior Litigation (GSIS v. City Assessor of Iloilo City):**  GSIS previously challenged the validity of the real property tax assessment and the auction sale proceedings on similar grounds (lack of notice, tax exemption). The CA and SC ultimately upheld the validity of the auction sale in this related case, G.R. No. 147192.
*   **Consignation:** Montaños paid the tax due by consignation, per Section 267 of the Local Government Code of 1991, before filing the action.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Taxpayer's Obligation:** The obligation to pay real property taxes rests with the *registered owner* (GSIS, at the time of the auction).
*   **City Treasurer's Obligation:** To comply with the notice and publication requirements under Section 73 of P.D. No. 464 prior to the auction sale. Specifically, notice to the delinquent taxpayer and publication for three consecutive weeks.
*   **Liability for Invalid Sale:** If the sale is deemed invalid due to procedural defects, the purchaser (Francisco) is entitled to a refund of the purchase price plus interest from the consignation per section 267 of the Local Government Code.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Notice to the Correct Party:** The crucial issue is whether notice to GSIS, as the registered owner, was sufficient, despite the Spouses Montaño's vested interest as conditional vendees.
*   **Compliance with P.D. No. 464, Section 73:**  The petitioners allege non-compliance with the strict requirements of P.D. No. 464 regarding notice and publication of the auction sale. Specific evidence concerning publication dates and methods of notification to GSIS and the Montaños must be examined.
*   **Impact of *GSIS v. City Assessor of Iloilo City*:** The Supreme Court's upholding of the tax assessment and auction sale in the previous GSIS case is *res judicata* and extremely detrimental to the Montaños' current claim. This is especially relevant as the CA relies on this related case.
*   **Montaño's rights under Deed of Conditional Sale:** The Montaños' rights under the Deed of Conditional Sale, while giving them an equitable interest in the property, do not automatically entitle them to the same legal protections as the registered owner (GSIS) concerning tax delinquency proceedings.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 464, Section 73 (Real Property Tax Code):** Governs the advertisement and sale of real property at public auction for tax delinquency.
*   **Local Government Code of 1991, Section 267:** Requirements for assailing validity of a tax sale.
*   **Talusan v. Tayag, 408 Phil. 373 (2001):** Establishes that the registered owner is considered the taxpayer for real property tax collection purposes.
*   **GSIS v. City Assessor of Iloilo City, G.R. No. 147192, June 27, 2006:**  The Supreme Court decision upholding the validity of the auction sale in the related case involving GSIS.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided text, the Spouses Montaño face a significant challenge in overturning the auction sale.  The Supreme Court decision in *GSIS v. City Assessor of Iloilo City* is a significant obstacle. The analysis should focus on whether the City Treasurer strictly complied with Section 73 of P.D. 464, even though the notice was given to GSIS. The case also demonstrates the importance of registering property ownership promptly to receive direct legal notices and protections.
