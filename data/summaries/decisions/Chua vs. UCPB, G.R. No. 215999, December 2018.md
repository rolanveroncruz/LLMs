Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court Resolution in *Sps. Chua vs. UCPB*, tailored for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Sps. Felix A. Chua and Carmen L. Chua, et al. vs. United Coconut Planters Bank, et al.* G.R. No. 215999, December 17, 2018.

**Nature of the Document:** Resolution on Motions for Reconsideration (MR) and other related motions concerning a prior Supreme Court Decision.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Joint Venture Agreement (JVA):**  The Chuas entered into a JVA with Gotesco (represented by Jose Go) to develop their land. Deeds of Absolute Sale transferred land to Revere Realty (Go's company), coupled with Deeds of Trust acknowledging the Chuas' continued ownership.
*   **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with UCPB:**  The Chuas consolidated their obligations with UCPB in a MOA.  The MOA involved conveying 30 parcels of land and converting the remaining debt into equity in LGCTI. Critical point: UCPB agreed to waive penalties and interests, leaving a balance.
*   **Real Estate Mortgages (REMs):** To implement the MOA, two REMs were executed, one between Chua's entity and UCPB, and another between Revere and UCPB involving different properties, however, the Chua's land was used. Both REMs were meant to secure a consolidated debt, including potential obligations of Jose Go.
*   **Foreclosure:**  UCPB foreclosed on both REMs. The issue is whether UCPB correctly applied the proceeds, especially regarding Go's liabilities. The Chuas contend their MOA obligations should have been satisfied first.
*   **Deed of Assignment of Liabilities**: Deed signed with UCPB consolidating obligations to the bank.

**Court's Ruling on the MRs:**

*   **Motions Denied:**  The Court denied all motions for reconsideration.
*   **Validity of Original Decision Affirmed:** The Court reiterated the decision of August 16, 2017, which reinstated the RTC's judgment in favor of the Chuas.
*   **Motion to Inhibit Denied:**  The Court rejected the motion to inhibit Justices, finding no grounds for mandatory disqualification or evidence of bias.
*   **Motion to Refer to En Banc Denied:** The Court found no basis to refer the case to the En Banc, as it did not meet the criteria outlined in the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court.
*   **Validity of the Revere REM: Invalid** UCPB could not foreclose properties from the Chuas' as Revere did not have the authority to do so.

**Liabilities and Obligations:**

*   **UCPB's Obligation:**
    *   UCPB must return the excess foreclosure proceeds to the plaintiffs.
    *   UCPB must reconvey to the plaintiffs the properties covered by the Revere REM, as the mortgage was nullified.
    *   UCPB must also return so much of the plaintiffs’ titles to the equivalent of 200,000,000.
    *   Pay moral, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs of suit.
*   **Debts settled**: Loan obligations of Chua have been fully paid.
*   **Extinguishment of REM**: Real Estate Mortgage dated June 02, 1997 is having been extinguished by the Memorandum of Agreement dated March 21, 2000

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Valuation of Properties:** Determining the exact value of the returned properties could be a point of contention. The Decision relies on a calculation per square meter, which might be subject to challenge.
*   **UCPB's Claims:** UCPB may continue to argue that the Deed of Assignment of Liabilities is valid, despite the Court’s ruling.

**Key Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 137 of the Rules of Court and Internal Rules of the Supreme Court:** Pertaining to disqualification/inhibition of judges.
*   **Section 3, Rule 2 of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court:** Lists matters appropriate for the Court En Banc.
*   **Section 9, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court (Parol Evidence Rule):** This rule bars evidence that contradicts the terms of a written agreement.
*   **Section 4, Rule 68, Rules of Court:** Disposition of proceeds of foreclosure sale.
*   **Civil Code Articles on Unjust Enrichment:** The Court relies on the principle of unjust enrichment to justify the return of properties to the Chuas.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Extent of Consent:**  The issue of whether and to what extent the Chuas consented to the Revere REM remains central.

**Justice Caguioa's Dissenting Opinion:**

*   Justice Caguioa partially dissents, arguing that the Revere REM was valid because the Chuas implicitly consented by entering into the MOA and the properties were included as part of the mortgaged real estate.
*   Justice Caguioa recommended the deed of real estate by Revere is considered valid.

This summary should provide a solid foundation for understanding the key legal aspects of this case.
