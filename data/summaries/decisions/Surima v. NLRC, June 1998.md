**Case Summary: *Antonio Surima v. National Labor Relations Commission and Loreta Pediapco Lim*, G.R. No. 121147, June 26, 1998 (353 Phil. 461)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari assailing NLRC decision regarding monetary awards following illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:**  Petitioner claimed illegal dismissal.  NLRC initially found dismissal illegal.
*   **Computation of Monetary Awards:** This is the central issue. Petitioner challenges the NLRC's computation of back wages, separation pay, wage differentials, 13th month pay, and service incentive leave pay, arguing that the NLRC arbitrarily limited the award to three years.
*   **Back Wages:** Article 279 of the Labor Code, as amended by RA 6715, entitles illegally dismissed employees to full back wages from the time compensation was withheld until actual reinstatement. NLRC limited back wages to 3 years. The SC held that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion.
*   **Separation Pay:** Awarded in lieu of reinstatement due to strained relations.
*   **Wage Differentials, 13th Month Pay, Service Incentive Leave Pay:** Petitioner argues for additional awards covering the three-year period before the complaint was filed, citing the three-year prescriptive period for money claims.
*   **Prescription (Art. 291, Labor Code):** Money claims arising from employer-employee relationships prescribe in three years.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** Petitioner's motion for recomputation was filed beyond the 10-day reglementary period, technically rendering the NLRC decision final and executory.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employer (Loreta Pediapco Lim):** Liable for monetary awards stemming from illegal dismissal, including back wages, separation pay, wage differentials, 13th month pay, service incentive leave pay, and attorney's fees.  The NLRC is responsible for recomputing the amounts based on the SC's ruling.
*   **Employee (Antonio Surima):** Obligated to comply with procedural rules, but the Court relaxed these rules in the interest of substantial justice.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 279 of the Labor Code (RA 6715):**  Governs reinstatement and back wages for illegally dismissed employees.
*   **Article 291 of the Labor Code:** Sets the three-year prescriptive period for money claims.
*   **Pines City Educational Center v. NLRC (G.R. No. 96779):** Initially established the rule that earnings derived from employment elsewhere during illegal dismissal should be deducted from back wages, but was reversed in *Bustamante v. NLRC*.
*   **Bustamante v. NLRC (G.R. No. 111651):** Overruled *Pines City*, holding that back wages should not be diminished by earnings elsewhere during the period of illegal dismissal.
*   **Gaco v. NLRC (G.R. No. 104690):** Established that back wages are to be computed up to the time of finality of the SC decision when reinstatement is not feasible.
*   **Uy v. NLRC (G.R. No. 117983):** Reaffirmed the 3-year prescriptive period to recover wage differentials

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Period for Computation:** The primary point of contention. NLRC's limitation to three years was deemed an abuse of discretion.  The SC directs computation to the finality of the related case G.R. No. 120404 on 28 August 1995.
*   **Wage Differentials:** The factual determination of whether the actual salary rate was below the minimum wage rate from 11 September 1987 to 11 September 1990 is left to the NLRC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Recomputation Dispute:**  The recomputation process may be complex and subject to further disputes regarding specific amounts and the minimum wage rate.
*   **Proof of Earnings (1987-1990):** Establishing wage differentials, 13th month pay, and service incentive leave for the period 1987-1990 may be challenging due to potential lack of records.
*   **Enforcement:**  Collecting the full amount due may pose challenges even after the recomputation is finalized.
