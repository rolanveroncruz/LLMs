**Case Summary: Republic v. Pilipinas Shell, G.R. No. 173918 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision which reversed the Office of the President, finding MOF Circular No. 1-85 ineffective.

**Key Issue:** Whether MOF Circular No. 1-85, as amended, imposing surcharges on late OPSF contributions, is valid and enforceable, considering its lack of publication and filing with the Office of the National Administrative Register (ONAR).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied the petition and affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that MOF Circular No. 1-85, as amended, is ineffective due to non-compliance with publication requirements under *Tañada v. Tuvera* and filing requirements under Section 3, Chapter 2, Book VII of the Administrative Code of 1987.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **MOF Circular No. 1-85 (as amended by DOF Circular No. 2-94):** Imposes a surcharge on late payments to the Oil Price Stabilization Fund (OPSF). Specifically, 15% if paid within thirty (30) days and an additional 2% per month thereafter.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1956:** Created the Oil Price Stabilization Fund (OPSF).
*   **Executive Order No. 137:** Amended P.D. 1956, reiterating the Minister of Finance's power to promulgate rules.
*   **Administrative Code of 1987, Section 3, Chapter 2, Book VII:** Mandates filing of administrative rules with the UP Law Center (ONAR). Rules in force at the time of effectivity of the Code had to be filed within three months; failure to do so prevents using the rule as a basis for sanctions.
*   **Republic Act No. 7638:** Mandates the Department of Energy to oversee all energy related plans, programs, projects and activities of the Government.

**Liabilities:**

*   The DOE sought to impose surcharges on Pilipinas Shell for underpayment of OPSF contributions, pursuant to MOF Circular No. 1-85.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Non-Publication/Non-Filing:** The core contentious issue is the lack of publication and filing of MOF Circular No. 1-85 and DOF Circular No. 2-94 with the ONAR. The certifications from ONAR confirm non-filing. The Court deemed these omissions fatal to the circular's validity.
*   **Waiver Argument:** The DOE argued that Pilipinas Shell waived its objection to the non-registration by paying the principal amount. The Court rejected this, stating that payment of the principal does not validate an invalid regulation concerning *surcharges*.
*   **Retroactivity Argument:** The DOE contended that E.O. 137 ratified MOF Circular 1-85. This was dismissed because the issue wasn't the *power* to issue regulations but compliance with *publication* requirements.
*   **Due Process:**  The Court highlighted that the publication and filing requirements are crucial safeguards for due process and access to information.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Tañada v. Tuvera:** Establishes the requirement for publication of laws and administrative rules for them to be effective.
*   **National Association of Electricity Consumers for Reforms v. Energy Regulatory Board:** Reiterates the mandatory nature of publication and filing requirements for administrative issuances.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The document doesn't present ambiguities in the MOF Circulars; rather the central problem is the lack of compliance with administrative rule making guidelines set by the administrative code, and reiterated in numerous cases, notably *Tañada vs. Tuvera.*

**Legal Analysis:**

The Supreme Court's decision rests squarely on the established doctrine that publication and filing are conditions sine qua non for the effectivity of administrative rules that implement existing laws. The failure to comply with these requirements renders MOF Circular No. 1-85, as amended, unenforceable. This is a fundamental principle to provide the public notice and avoid arbitrary government action.  Shell's payment of the principal amount does not constitute a waiver of the publication requirement pertaining to surcharges.  The DOE cannot rely on the circular as a basis for imposing surcharges.
