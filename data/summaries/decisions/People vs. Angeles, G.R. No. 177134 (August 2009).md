## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Angeles* (G.R. No. 177134)

**Case Summary:** This case involves Rachel Angeles' appeal of her murder conviction (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code) for the stabbing death of Michael Coligado. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld the RTC's conviction with modifications to damages.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Murder (qualified by treachery)
*   **Facts:** Appellant allegedly stabbed the victim during an argument over fare, while an unknown accomplice held the victim's hands. The SC affirmed the eyewitness testimony placing Angeles at the scene with a knife.
*   **Alibi Defense:** Rejected due to proximity of appellant's residence to the crime scene and inadequate corroboration from appellant's mother. The mother admitted she could not be absolutely certain if the appellant left the house after she slept.
*   **Treachery:** Upheld as the victim was rendered unable to defend himself.
*   **Voluntary Surrender:** Claimed but rejected. The SC held that he "was merely forced by circumstances".

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant (Rachel Angeles):** Liable for reclusion perpetua, payment of P50,000 for loss of life, P50,000 moral damages, and P25,000 each for temperate and exemplary damages.
*   **Heirs of Victim (Michael Coligado):** Entitled to receive damages as outlined above.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"John Doe" Accomplice:** The failure to identify and prosecute the alleged accomplice raises questions about the completeness of the investigation. The conspiracy charge and the absence of the co-conspirator can be explored for grounds for a motion for reconsideration.
*   **Evidence of conspiracy** The prosecution witness testified that one unknown person was holding the hands of the victim but the person has not been found.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** Appellant's claim of voluntary surrender was rejected due to the lack of showing of intent to surrender and accept responsibility for the death of the victim.
*   **Damage Awards:** The calculation and justification of damages (especially moral, temperate, and exemplary) are often subject to legal challenges. The reduction of moral damages from the RTC's award of P200,000 to P50,000 by the CA may be further challenged based on the suffering endured by the victim's family.
