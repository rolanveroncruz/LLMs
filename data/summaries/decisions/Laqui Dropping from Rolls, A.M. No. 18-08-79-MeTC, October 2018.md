**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 18-08-79-MeTC**

**Subject:** Dropping from the Rolls of Victor R. Laqui, Jr., Cash Clerk II, MeTC Manila

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Dropping from the Rolls (AWOL):** Victor R. Laqui, Jr. is dropped from the rolls effective March 1, 2018, due to Absence Without Official Leave (AWOL) since March 1, 2018. The position is declared vacant. This is based on Section 107 a-1, Rule 20 of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RACCS).

*   **Employee Rights:** Laqui is still qualified to receive benefits he may be entitled to under existing laws and may still be reemployed in the government.

*   **Non-Disciplinary Action:** Separation from service for unauthorized absences is non-disciplinary in nature per Sec. 110, Rule 20 of the 2017 RACCS. This means no forfeiture of benefits or disqualification from government re-employment.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employee Obligation:** Laqui had a duty to submit Daily Time Records (DTRs) and seek leave for absences. He failed to do so. He has a right to appeal the separation within 15 days of notice.

*   **Government Obligation:** The Court has an obligation to maintain efficiency in public service and hold employees accountable. The Court must send Laqui a copy of the Resolution at his last known address.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Employee Liability:** Laqui's continued absence is considered a violation of his duty to serve the public with responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency.

*   **Potential Employer Liability:** Court must comply with Section 110 of the 2017 RACCS regarding non-disciplinary procedures and benefits.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Employee Appeal:** Laqui may appeal the separation within 15 days of receiving notice.
*   **Ambiguity:** The term "benefits he may be entitled to" is open to interpretation and could lead to disputes.
*   **Notice Requirement:** Ensuring proper notice to Laqui at his last known address is crucial to avoid procedural challenges.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

**Recommendations:**

*   Ensure proper service of the Resolution.
*   Prepare for a potential appeal by Laqui.
*   Clearly define and document the specific benefits Laqui is entitled to receive.
