## Legal Document Summary - *Alfredo A. Ramos v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 233572, July 30, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC conviction of Petitioner for violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 11, Article II of RA 9165:** Defines and penalizes illegal possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 (as it existed prior to amendment by RA 10640):** Mandates specific procedures for handling seized drugs, including:
    *   Immediate physical inventory and photography of seized items.
    *   Presence of the accused (or representative), a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official during inventory and photography.
    *   All representatives must sign the inventory, and be given a copy.
*   **IRR of RA 9165:** Clarifies that inventory and photography may be conducted at the nearest police station in cases of warrantless seizures. Provides a "saving clause" where non-compliance with Section 21 requirements may not invalidate the seizure if justifiable grounds exist and the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved.
*   **RA 10640 (Amendment to Section 21):** Postdates the crime. Amended Section 21 to only require two witnesses (an elected public official and either a representative from the National Prosecution Service or the media).
*   **Prosecution's Obligation:** To prove beyond a reasonable doubt all elements of the crime, including establishing an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drug, demonstrating the integrity of the *corpus delicti*, and justifying any deviations from Section 21 procedures.

**Liabilities:**

*   RTC found Ramos guilty, sentencing him to 12 years, 1 day to 13 years imprisonment and a P300,000 fine.
*   CA affirmed the RTC ruling.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody Issues:**  The Court found that the prosecution failed to prove an unbroken chain of custody.
*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21 Requirements:** The inventory was conducted without the presence of a DOJ representative, a media representative, or an elected public official. The Court found the justification for this absence ("they exerted effort but nobody was available") insufficient.
*   **Lack of Justifiable Grounds:** The prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21, as required to invoke the "saving clause" in the IRR of RA 9165. Mere statements of unavailability are insufficient.
*  **Presumption of Regularity Rebutted:** Presumption of regularity cannot substitute compliance with Section 21.
*  **Quantity of Drugs:** Courts are more stringent with chain of custody when the quantity of drugs is small.
*   **Discretion on Sufficiency of Compliance:** As highlighted in Justice Peralta's concurrence, the issue of sufficiency of compliance is primarily the judiciary's prerogative to decide.
*   **Police investigation procedures and evidence admissibility:** Non-compliance with police administrative procedure regarding chain of custody does not affect the validity of the seizure of evidence as that issue is anchored on admissibility of evidence and is within the jurisdiction of the courts.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 11:** Defines the crime of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21:** Mandates procedures for handling seized drugs.
*   **RA 10640:** Amended Section 21 (but not applicable to this case).
*   **IRR of RA 9165, Section 21(a):** Implements and clarifies Section 21, including providing the "saving clause."
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Emphasizes the importance of the presence of required witnesses to maintain the integrity of evidence.
*   **People v. Almorfe, 631 Phil. 51 (2010):** Requires the prosecution to explain reasons for procedural lapses and prove the integrity of the seized evidence.
*   **People v. De Guzman, 630 Phil. 637 (2010):** Requires justifiable grounds for non-compliance to be proven as a fact.
*   **People v. Umipang, 686 Phil. 1024 (2012):** Emphasizes the need for earnest efforts to secure the required witnesses, not just mere statements of unavailability.
* **People v. Sagana, G.R. No. 208471, August 2, 2017:** Guarantees presence of the three witnesses was intended as a guarantee against planting of evidence and frame up
*   **People v. Teng Moner y Adam G.R. No. 202206, March 5, 2018:** The Court has the last say regarding the appreciation of evidence.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the appeal and **ACQUITTED** Alfredo A. Ramos. The decision emphasizes the importance of strict compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 and the prosecution's burden to justify deviations.
