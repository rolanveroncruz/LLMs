**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Warlito Martinez*, G.R. No. 182687 (2009)

**Summary:** This is an appeal upholding the conviction of Warlito Martinez for three counts of qualified rape against his mentally retarded daughter, AAA. The RTC originally sentenced him to death, but the CA modified this to *reclusion perpetua* due to Republic Act No. 9346. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, further modifying the exemplary damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crimes Charged:** Three counts of qualified rape under Article 395 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended in relation to RA 7695, based on three separate incidents.
*   **Elements of the Offense:** Carnal knowledge of AAA by the accused and that AAA is his daughter.
*   **Defenses:** The accused-appellant raised the defenses of denial and alibi.
*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decision, affirming that the requirements for qualified rape have been met in all three counts of the crime.

**Obligations:**

*   The accused-appellant is obligated to serve the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* for each count of rape.
*   The accused-appellant is obligated to pay PhP 75,000 as civil indemnity, PhP 75,000 as moral damages, and PhP 30,000 as exemplary damages for each count of rape to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** The accused-appellant is criminally liable for the crime of qualified rape.
*   **Civil Liability:** The accused-appellant is civilly liable for the damages caused to the victim.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness (AAA):** The main contention revolves around the credibility of the victim's testimony due to her mental retardation. The defense argued that it affects her ability to accurately recall and convey her experience, potentially leading to fabrication or coaching. *People v. Tabio*, *People v. Macapal, Jr.* and *People v. Martin* was cited by the Supreme Court to affirm that mental retardation by itself does not disqualify a person from testifying.
*   **Lack of Conclusive Physical Evidence:** The defense attempted to discredit the medical report, arguing that the hymenal lacerations were not conclusive proof of rape and could have resulted from other causes.
*   **Alibi:** The accused-appellant claimed that it was impossible for him to rape his daughter because he was at the river about 50 meters away from their house.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 395 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended) in relation to Republic Act No. 7695:** Defines and penalizes the crime of qualified rape.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, leading to the modification of the sentence to *reclusion perpetua*.
