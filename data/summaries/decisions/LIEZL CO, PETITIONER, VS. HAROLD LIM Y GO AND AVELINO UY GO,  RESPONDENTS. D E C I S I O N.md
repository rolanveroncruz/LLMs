**Case:** *Liezl Co v. Harold Lim y Go and Avelino Uy Go*, G.R. Nos. 164669-70, October 30, 2009 (619 Phil. 704)

**Summary:**

This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the RTC's dismissal of criminal charges (Violation of PD 1612, the Anti-Fencing Law) against respondents Lim and Go, based on the DOJ's directive to withdraw the Informations. The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the RTC's dismissal, holding that the trial court abdicated its judicial duty by relying solely on the DOJ's resolution without making an independent assessment of probable cause. The SC remanded the case to the RTC for the court to rule on the merits of the case based on independent assessment of evidence if a probable cause exist to resolve the Motion to Withdraw Informations.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PD 1612 (Anti-Fencing Law):** Defines "fencing" as buying, receiving, possessing, etc., articles derived from robbery or theft with intent to gain, knowing or having reason to know they were stolen. Section 5 establishes a presumption of fencing based on mere possession of stolen goods.
*   **Elements of Fencing:** Prosecution must prove (1) robbery or theft occurred; (2) accused bought, received, etc., the stolen item; (3) accused knew or should have known the item was stolen; (4) intent to gain.
*   **Obligation of Trial Court:** The RTC has a duty to independently evaluate the evidence and determine the existence of probable cause, even after a DOJ resolution directs withdrawal of the Information. *Santos v. Orda, Jr., 481 Phil. 93, 105-106 (2004)*.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Liability (PD 1612):** Respondents face criminal liability for fencing if probable cause and all elements are proven.
*   **Potential Civil Liability:** The Order of the RTC stated the private prosecutor can present evidence on the civil aspect of these cases on the ground that the civil actions in these cases were deemed instituted with the criminal actions and that there was no reservation made to file a separate civil action and therefore the civil cases remain pending with this court since extinction of the penal action does not carry with it extinction of the civil action.
*   **Risk of Trial Court Reversal:** The RTC's initial dismissal was reversed due to its failure to exercise independent judgment. A renewed determination of probable cause is now required.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **PD 1612 (Anti-Fencing Law):** Crucial statute defining the crime and its elements.
*   **Section 21, Article III of the Constitution**:  Guarantees protection against double jeopardy.
*   **Section 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Court**: Forum Shopping Rule
*   **Santos v. Orda, Jr., 481 Phil. 93, 105-106 (2004):** Establishes the trial court's duty to independently assess probable cause. *See also Summerville General Merchandising & Co. Inc. v.

No. 156132, 16 October 2006, 504 SCRA 378, 406.*

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Should have known":** The phrase "should have known" in PD 1612 is often contentious, requiring proof that a reasonable person would have recognized the goods as stolen.
*   **Double Jeopardy Claim:** The respondents' claim of double jeopardy was rejected because the dismissal was based on their own motion, meaning it was *with* their express consent.

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   **Prosecution:** The prosecution must now present sufficient evidence to establish probable cause to the RTC's satisfaction, independent of the DOJ's earlier resolution. They must prove all elements of PD 1612 beyond reasonable doubt at trial.
*   **Defense:** The defense must vigorously challenge the evidence presented by the prosecution, focusing on weaknesses in proving knowledge that the goods were stolen and intent to gain, and potentially arguing lack of evidence of the underlying theft.
