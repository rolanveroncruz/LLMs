## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Maderazo* (G.R. No. 235348)

**Type:** Decision on Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45)

**Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in nullifying Search Warrant Nos. 09-2015 and 10-2015 and suppressing evidence seized thereunder due to grave abuse of discretion by the issuing judge.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, holding that the issuing judge failed to conduct the probing and exhaustive inquiry required by the Constitution and Rules of Court to establish probable cause.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 2, Article III, 1987 Constitution & Rule 126, Sections 4 & 5, 2000 Rules on Criminal Procedure:** These provisions outline the requirements for issuing a valid search warrant, mandating probable cause determined personally by the judge, after examining under oath the complainant and witnesses, based on personal knowledge. The warrant must particularly describe the place and items to be seized.
*   **Probable Cause Determination:** The issuing judge must conduct a "full and searching examination" that is probing and exhaustive, not merely routinary. Questions should not be repetitive of affidavits.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Illegal Search & Seizure:** Evidence obtained through a search warrant issued without probable cause or in violation of constitutional and procedural requirements is inadmissible ("fruit of the poisonous tree"). *Roan v. Gonzales, 230 Phil. 90 (1986).*
*   **Illegal Possession of Firearms:** The prosecution must prove both the existence of the firearm and the lack of a license or permit to possess it. *Del Rosario v. People, 410 Phil. 642 (2001).*

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Worldwide Web Corp., et al. v. People, et al., 724 Phil. 18 (2014):*** Outlines the Constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures.
*   ***Oebanda, et al. v. People, 786 Phil. 706 (2016):*** Explains the necessity of a full and searching examination by the judge in probable cause determination.
*   ***Coca-Cola Bottlers, Phils., Inc. v. Gomez, et al., 591 Phil. 642 (2008):*** Emphasizes the judge's personal task in determining probable cause.
*   ***Columbia Pictures, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 329 Phil. 875 (1996):*** Defines probable cause and the requirement of personal knowledge by the applicant and witnesses.
*   ***Cupcupin v. People, 440 Phil. 714 (2002):*** Hearsay information or tips from confidential informants could serve as basis for issuance of search warrant if validated.
*   ***Sony Music Entertainment v. Judge Espanol, 493 Phil. 507 (2005):*** Testimony based on hearsay is of no evidentiary weight or probative value.
*   ***Paper Industries Corporation of the Philippines (PICOP) v. Asuncion, 366 Phil. 717 (1999):*** Highlights the necessity to prove the lack of license to possess firearms.
*   ***Del Rosario v. People, 410 Phil. 642 (2001):*** Emphasizes that possession of any firearm becomes unlawful only if the required permit or license is not first obtained.
*   ***Nala v. Judge Barroso, Jr., 455 Phil. 999 (2003):*** No presumption of regularity when justifying an encroachment of rights secured by the Constitution.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The court found that the identical questions and answers in the sworn statements of the witnesses indicated a lack of personal examination by the judge. This suggests a *per se* rule against similar statements, which could be contentious depending on the specific circumstances.
*   The reliance on Maderazo's alleged admission to the barangay officials, without probing how that admission was obtained, was deemed insufficient to establish probable cause.

**Analysis and Advice:**

The case reiterates the strict requirements for issuing a search warrant and emphasizes the crucial role of the issuing judge in personally determining probable cause through a thorough examination. The ruling highlights the potential for suppression of evidence if the search warrant is deemed invalid due to procedural or substantive defects.

**Potential Risks:** The prosecution's case against Maderazo for illegal possession of drugs, drug paraphernalia, and firearms is severely weakened due to the suppression of the evidence seized under the invalid search warrants.
