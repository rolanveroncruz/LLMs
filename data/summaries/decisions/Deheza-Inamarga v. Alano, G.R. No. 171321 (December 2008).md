**Legal Document Summary - *Deheza-Inamarga v. Alano*, G.R. No. 171321, December 18, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC decision declaring a Deed of Sale null and void and recognizing an equitable mortgage.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Equitable Mortgage (Art. 1602, 1604 Civil Code):** The transaction between Petitioner and the Spouses Alano was correctly declared an equitable mortgage rather than a sale due to inadequacy of price, continued possession by the vendors, and the intent to secure a debt. *Dorado Vda. de Delfin v. Dellota, G.R. No. 143697, January 28, 2008, 542 SCRA 397, 401* defines Equitable Mortgage.
*   **Nullity of Deed of Sale:**  The Court affirmed the lower court's finding that the Deed of Sale was a forgery. The CA compared signatures on the document to genuine signatures of the Alanos. It also rejected the argument that expert testimony was required to prove forgery (*Gamido v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 111962-72, December 8, 1995, 251 SCRA 101, 109*). Since there was no valid consent, it was declared void.
*   **Reconveyance:** The Court ordered the reconveyance of the land to the respondents. The TCTs in the name of the petitioner was also declared void and ordered cancelled.
*   **Prescription/Laches/Estoppel:** The Court rejected the argument that the action was barred by prescription, laches, or estoppel because the Deed of Sale was deemed void *ab initio* (Art. 1410, Civil Code).
*   **Damages:** Exemplary damages and attorney's fees were awarded due to the Petitioner's fraudulent acts. The Court cited Article 2208 of the Civil Code.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioner must reconvey the land to the Respondents.
*   Respondents must pay Petitioner P2,400.00 with legal interest from 1983 to redeem the equitable mortgage.
*   Petitioner must pay exemplary damages (P50,000) and attorney's fees (P10,000).

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner is liable for damages due to her fraudulent acts.
*   Petitioner is liable for costs.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation of Mortgage Debt:** The court did not specify the calculation of the legal interest from 1983, which could lead to disputes.
*   **Enforcement of Reconveyance:** If Petitioner fails to reconvey, the Clerk of Court will execute the reconveyance per Rule 39, Sec. 10 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. There may be obstacles or delays in this process.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Art. 1410, Art. 1602, Art. 1604, Art. 2208.
*   **Rules of Civil Procedure:** Rule 39, Section 10
*   **Relevant Case Law:** *Dorado Vda. de Delfin v. Dellota, G.R. No. 143697, January 28, 2008, 542 SCRA 397, 401*, *Cogtong v. Kyoritsu International, Inc., G.R. No. 160729, July 27, 2007, 528 SCRA 330, 333*, *Gamido v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 111962-72, December 8, 1995, 251 SCRA 101, 109*

**Contentious Clauses:** The finding of forgery without expert testimony might be considered a contentious point. The adequacy of evidence presented to prove the intent to secure a debt instead of a true sale could also be challenged, though the court found sufficient evidence based on Article 1602, Civil Code.
