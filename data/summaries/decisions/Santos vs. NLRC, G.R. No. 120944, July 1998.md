## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Santos v. NLRC and Pamplona*, G.R. No. 120944

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing the NLRC decision affirming the Labor Arbiter's ruling which ordered the petitioners to pay Ludovico Pamplona (private respondent) wage differential, 13th month pay, service incentive leave pay, and attorney’s fees.

**Key Issue:** Whether an employer-employee relationship existed between Spouses Santos (petitioners) and Ludovico Pamplona (private respondent).  Collaterally, whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the admission of the petitioners' supplemental memorandum of appeal introducing new evidence.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition for certiorari, affirming the NLRC's decision.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The Court upheld the findings of the Labor Arbiter and NLRC that an employer-employee relationship existed, based on substantial evidence:
    *   Private respondent's affidavit and affidavit of a witness, Bonifacio Mirasol, detailing work history and conditions.
    *   Application of the four-fold test: selection/engagement, wage payment, power of dismissal, and control (citing *Viaña v. Al-Lagadan*, 99 Phil. 408, 411-412 (1956); *Sandigan Savings and Loan Bank, Inc. v. NLRC*, 254 SCRA 126 (1996); *Jimenez v. NLRC*, 256 SCRA 84 (1996)).
    *   Petitioners' failure to present payrolls or disprove employment.

*   **Denial of Supplemental Appeal:** The NLRC did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioners' motion for leave to file and admit their supplemental memorandum of appeal containing new evidence. The failure to present the evidence earlier was not justified.

*   **Substantial Evidence:** The NLRC and Labor Arbiter's findings are based on substantial evidence, given deference by the Supreme Court (citing *Western Shipping Agency, Inc. v. NLRC*, 253 SCRA 405, 410 (1996); *Cocoland Development Corp. v. NLRC*, 259 SCRA 51, 59 (1996)).

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioners are obligated to pay private respondent wage differential, 13th month pay, service incentive leave pay, and attorney’s fees, as determined by the Labor Arbiter.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable for violating labor laws by underpaying wages, failing to provide mandated benefits, and failing to report private respondent's employment to the Social Security System (SSS).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Payroll Evidence:** Petitioners' failure to present payroll records (or alternative evidence) severely undermined their defense.
*   **Reliance on Affidavits:**  Petitioners’ argument that a full-blown trial was necessary given the conflicting affidavits was rejected due to their failure to timely request such a hearing and belatedly filing their position paper.
*   **Counsel Negligence:** The petitioners tried arguing their prior counsel was grossly negligent. The court rejected this argument citing *Legarda v. Court of Appeals*, 195 SCRA 419 (1991) and highlighting that this situation did not rise to the level of gross negligence necessary to overturn the general rule that a counsel’s mistake binds the client.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 280, Labor Code:** Definition of "employee".  Cited to support the claim that the private respondent was indeed an employee based on the work he was assigned to do which was necessary and desirable to the business of the petitioners.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Basis for petition for certiorari.
*   **Rule VII, §3 of the Revised Rules of the NLRC:** Labor arbiters have the power to “determine whether there is a need for a formal hearing or investigation . . . after the submission by the parties of their position papers and supporting proofs.”
