## Legal Document Summary: *Nicorp Management and Development Corporation vs. Leonida De Leon*

**Case:** *Nicorp Management and Development Corporation vs. Leonida De Leon*, G.R. No. 176942 & G.R. No. 177125, August 28, 2008.

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions assailing CA decision reversing DARAB decision finding Leonida de Leon as a bona fide tenant.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Nicorp Management and Development Corporation, Salvador R. Lim
*   **Respondent:** Leonida de Leon

**Key Issue:** Whether Leonida de Leon is a de jure tenant of the subject land.

**Facts:**

*   Respondent filed a complaint to be recognized as a tenant and for petitioners to respect her tenancy rights over the subject property.
*   Petitioners claimed Respondent was not a tenant, citing lack of consent from landowners, MARO certification of no registered tenant, and the land's reclassification as residential.
*   CA reversed DARAB, finding sufficient evidence of tenancy based on a letter allegedly acknowledging Respondent's son as a tenant.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court (SC) **granted** the petitions, reversing the CA and reinstating the DARAB decision that dismissed the complaint.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Elements of Tenancy:** The SC reiterated the six essential elements of a tenancy relationship: (1) landowner/tenant parties, (2) agricultural land, (3) consent to the relationship, (4) agricultural production purpose, (5) personal cultivation by tenant, and (6) harvest sharing. *Citing Dalwampo v. Quinocol Farm Workers and Settlers' Association, G.R. No. 160614, April 25, 2006, 488 SCRA 208, 221.*
*   **Burden of Proof:** The SC emphasized that all elements must be proven by substantial evidence. *Citing Suarez v. Saul, G.R. No. 166664, October 20, 2005, 473 SCRA 628, 634.*
*   **Succession of Leasehold Rights:** Discussed Section 9 of R.A. 3844, emphasizing the specified order of succession and the absence of a direct ascendant (parent) in that order.
*   **Extinguishment of Leasehold Relations:** Explained that, per Section 8 of R.A. 3844, the agricultural leasehold relation is extinguished by the absence of the persons stated under Section 9, in the event of death or permanent incapacity of the lessee.

**Liabilities:**

*   The CA held that the sale of the land violated Section 70 of R.A. No. 6657. The SC reversed the holding as the property was not covered by CARP.
*   R.A. No. 6657, Sections 65 and 73 (c) regarding land conversion; Section 65 applies only to land covered by CARP, and the sale was not made to avoid R.A. 6657.
*   No violation of R.A. No. 3844 (Agricultural Tenancy Act) because respondent not a de jure tenant, therefore no right of pre-emption or redemption under Sections 11 and 12.
*   The court noted that respondent was not a qualified successor to her deceased son's leasehold.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity of Evidence:** The letter presented as evidence of consent was deemed ambiguous, and the term "kasama" could be interpreted in different ways.
*   **Insufficient Evidence of Harvest Sharing:** Affidavits from neighboring farmers were insufficient to prove the sharing of produce, lacking specific details.
*   **Impact of Land Use Classification:** The SC noted that there was no CARP coverage, and that the landâ€™s conversion to residential was the basis for the DARAB decision.

**Key Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law - CARL)
*   Republic Act No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code)
*   Section 8, 9, 11, 12 of RA 3844
*   Section 65 & 73 of RA 6657

**Case Law Referenced:**

*   *Dalwampo v. Quinocol Farm Workers and Settlers' Association, G.R. No. 160614, April 25, 2006, 488 SCRA 208, 221.*
*   *Suarez v. Saul, G.R. No. 166664, October 20, 2005, 473 SCRA 628, 634.*
*   *Ambayec v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 162780, June 21, 2005, 460 SCRA 537, 543.*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of the word "kasama" in the letter from Susana De Leon.
*   Whether the affidavits of neighboring farmers sufficiently proved the element of harvest sharing.

**Conclusion:**

The SC held that the respondent failed to prove by substantial evidence all the elements of a tenancy relationship, particularly consent and sharing of harvest, thus reversing the CA decision. The ambiguity of the documentary evidence and the lack of specificity in the testimonial evidence were key factors in the decision.
