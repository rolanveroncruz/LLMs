**Case Summary: *Gomez v. PNOC Development and Management Corporation (PDMC)*, G.R. No. 174044, November 27, 2009**

**Issue:**  Whether Gloria Gomez, in her capacity as Administrator of PDMC, was a regular employee, making her illegal dismissal and non-payment of wages claims fall under the NLRC's jurisdiction, or a corporate officer, placing the matter under the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court (RTC).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court held that Gomez was a regular employee, not a corporate officer, and thus her case falls under the jurisdiction of the NLRC.

**Key Provisions & Rationale:**

*   **Corporate Officer vs. Regular Employee:** The Court distinguished between corporate officers (elected/appointed by directors or stockholders, per Corporation Code and by-laws) and ordinary employees (hired by managing officer, compensation determined by managing officer).

*   **Appointment & Compensation:** Gomez was appointed Administrator by the PDMC president, not the Board of Directors, and the president alone determined her compensation. This aligns with characteristics of a regular employee.

*   **Absence in By-laws:** The position of Administrator was *not* among the corporate officer positions listed in PDMC's by-laws. While the board had the power to create additional corporate offices, no formal action/intention to create such an office was demonstrated.

*   **Acts inconsistent with Corporate Office:** PDMC consistently treated Gomez as a regular employee by enrolling her in SSS, Medicare, Pag-Ibig, Savings Plan, Retirement Plan, Group hospitalization, conducting employee performance appraisals, granting leave and stock options, withholding taxes as an employee. These actions create an employer-employee relationship through *estoppel*. Citing *Philippine National Bank v. Palma*, the court emphasized that PDMC is estopped from claiming Gomez was a corporate officer given their prior actions and representations.

*   **Dual Role:**  The fact that Gomez also served as Corporate Secretary is not determinative. The Court referred to *Elleccion Vda. De Lecciones v. National Labor Relations Commission* supporting the possibilty of a dual role of officer and employee, and holding that the money claims were made as an employee and not as a corporate officer. A person can serve both as an officer and an employee.

*   **Rejection of Ultra Vires Argument:**  The company's attempt to argue that the president's term extension was *ultra vires* and required board approval was rejected because of their prior and consistent conduct of treating Gomez as a regular employee.

**Statutory/Case Law References:**

*   **Corporation Code:** Defines corporate officers.
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) 902-A (amended by R.A. 8799):**  Formerly governed SEC jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes, now transferred to RTC.
*   **Easycall Communications Phils., Inc. v. King, G.R. No. 145901:**  Defines criteria for identifying corporate officers versus employees.
*   **Nacpil v. International Broadcasting Corporation, 429 Phil. 410:** Discusses how corporate officers are elected or appointed
*   **Philippine National Bank v. Palma, G.R. No. 157279:** Establishes the principle of estoppel applies to corporations
*    **Rural Bank of Coron (Palawan), Inc. v. Cortes, G.R. No. 164888** states that A corporation is not prohibited from hiring a corporate officer to perform services under circumstances which will make him an employee.
*   **Elleccion Vda. De Lecciones v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 184735:** upheld NLRC's jurisdiction over a complaint filed by one who served both as a corporate secretary and administrator.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Risk of Future Misclassification:** This case clarifies the distinction between corporate officers and employees, reducing the risk of future misclassifications driven by attempts to circumvent labor laws.
*   **Doctrine of Estoppel:**  The strong reliance on estoppel emphasizes the need for consistent corporate action regarding employee classifications. Inconsistent treatment can lead to unfavorable legal outcomes.
*   **Corporate By-Laws vs. Actual Practice:**  The decision highlights that formal designations in the by-laws are not conclusive; the *actual practice* and treatment of an individual determine their status.
*   **Potential for Similar Claims:** PDMC now faces potential liabilities for illegal dismissal, unpaid wages, and benefits.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court's decision emphasizes that substance prevails over form in determining employee status. The consistent treatment of Gomez as a regular employee, the absence of formal board action appointing her as a corporate officer, and the lack of designation in the company's by-laws all contributed to the finding that the NLRC has jurisdiction over her claims.
