**Case Summary: _Victoriano P. Resurrecion vs. Atty. Ciriaco C. Sayson_ (A.C. No. 1037, December 14, 1998)**

**Nature:** Disbarment proceedings against Atty. Ciriaco C. Sayson.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Complaint:** Victoriano P. Resurrecion filed a complaint alleging malpractice, deceit, and gross misconduct against Atty. Sayson for misappropriating P2,500 intended as settlement in a homicide through reckless imprudence case where Sayson represented the offended party (Mr. Armando Basto Sr.).
*   **Misappropriation:** Resurrecion paid Sayson P2,500 for settlement, but Sayson failed to remit the amount to Basto. Resurrecion had to pay Basto again to settle the case.
*   **Criminal Conviction:** Sayson was convicted of Estafa by the City Court of Quezon City in relation to this incident. This conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and upheld by the Supreme Court.
*   **IBP Recommendation:** The Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) investigated the case and recommended Sayson's disbarment, finding that Resurrecion established the misappropriation, and the facts were uncontroverted by Sayson.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Sayson's Duty:** As a lawyer, Sayson had a fiduciary duty to handle client funds honestly and deliver them as instructed. He failed in this duty, leading to financial harm to Resurrecion.
*   **Liability:** Sayson is liable for moral turpitude due to the estafa conviction. This directly violates his oath as a lawyer.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Delay:** The case resolution took 27 years, partially due to Sayson's non-appearance at hearings and failure to update his address with the IBP. This delay could be argued as prejudicial, though the delay was attributed to Sayson.
*   **Lack of Remorse/Restitution:** The court notes Sayson never served his sentence, reimbursed Resurrecion, or expressed remorse.
*   **No Controversial Issues.**

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Moral Turpitude:** The court cites *In re Vinzon* (19 SCRA 815) and *Villanueva v. Sta. Ana* (245 SCRA 707) to support the argument that estafa involves moral turpitude and warrants disbarment.
*   **Legal and Judicial Ethics:** Cited the importance of upholding the law for lawyers and engaging in no deceitful conduct. *Ex parte Wall, 107 U.S. 265; cited in Malcolm, Legal and Judicial Ethics, p. 214.*
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 315:** Defines and penalizes Estafa
*   **Good Moral Character Requirement:** The court cites precedent that good moral character is essential for lawyers, both for admission and continued standing in the profession.
*   **Disbarment Standard:** Acknowledges that disbarment is a severe penalty but justifies it due to Sayson's established culpability, lack of remorse, and disregard for the proceedings.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the IBP's recommendation and disbarred Atty. Sayson. The basis for the disbarment is Sayson's conviction for estafa, which the Court deems an act of moral turpitude rendering him unfit to practice law. The lack of mitigating factors, such as restitution or remorse, further solidified the Court's decision.
