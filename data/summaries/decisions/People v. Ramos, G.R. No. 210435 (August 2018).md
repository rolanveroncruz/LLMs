## Legal Document Summary: *People of the Philippines v. Sonny Ramos y Buenaflor*, G.R. No. 210435 (2018)

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal by Sonny Ramos (Appellant) of his conviction for rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals (CA). The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately dismissed the appeal, affirming the CA's decision.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Rape, defined under Article 266-A RPC as carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat, or intimidation.
*   **Elements of Rape Proven:** The prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that Ramos had carnal knowledge of the victim, AAA, through force and intimidation, i.e., pushing, pinning down, and inserting his penis into her vagina without her consent.
*   **Victim's Testimony:** The SC gave credence to AAA's testimony, stating that conviction often rests solely on the victim's credible testimony, which was found to be natural, convincing, and consistent. The Court acknowledged AAA's actions following the rape to be indicative of the truth and veracity of her claim.
*   **Absence of Injuries:** The SC reiterated existing case law (e.g., *People v. Zafra*, 712 Phil. 559 (2013)) that the absence of physical injuries (abrasions/contusions) does not negate rape. *People v. Barangan*, 560 Phil. 811, 836 (2007), also states that the force used need not be overpowering, which in the context of the case was a consideration given the relative sizes of the aggressor and the victim.
*   **Victim's Conduct:** The SC refuted Ramos's argument that AAA's conduct (not immediately reporting a previous rape, continuing to work at the hotel, and not screaming) was inconsistent with that of a rape victim, citing the unpredictability of reactions to trauma (*People v. Paras*, 735 Phil. 193, 202 (2014)). They deemed her explanation for not reporting the prior incident (fear of Ramos's threats) as adequate.
*   **"Sweetheart Defense":** The SC rejected Ramos's "sweetheart defense," stating that in such cases, there must be *compelling evidence* of a relationship and consent, neither of which Ramos could provide (*People v. Olesco*, 663 Phil. 15, 24 (2011)).
*   **Evidentiary Issue:** Ramos claimed the trial court refused to allow him to present a SIM card with text messages. However, the Court found Ramos had deleted these messages, and that this claim was an attempt to mislead.
*   **Penalties:** Ramos was sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole, as provided under Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353. The Court also awarded AAA Php 75,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php 75,000.00 as moral damages, and Php 75,000.00 as exemplary damages, plus costs of suit and legal interest (6% per annum from finality of decision). *People v. Jugueta*, 783 Phil. 806, 827 (2016) and *People of the Philippines v. Rommel Ronquillo*, G.R. No. 214762, September 20, 2017 are cited to set the damage amounts.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   The case relies heavily on the victim's testimony. While the SC found it credible, the absence of corroborating evidence (besides medical findings of hymenal lacerations, which only prove sexual contact) is a point of vulnerability.
*   The "sweetheart defense," although rejected here, could be a viable strategy in similar cases if the accused could present credible evidence of a consensual relationship, which would cast doubt on the element of force or intimidation.
