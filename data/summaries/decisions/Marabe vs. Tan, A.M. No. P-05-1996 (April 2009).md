## Legal Document Summary: *Marabe v. Tan* (A.M. NO. P-05-1996)

**Nature of Document:**  Supreme Court Decision in an administrative matter.

**Summary:** This case involves an administrative complaint filed by Estelito Marabe, President of Asian Hills Bank, against Tyrone Tan, Sheriff IV, for inefficiency and ineffectiveness in failing to implement writs of execution despite receiving advance funds. The Court found Tan guilty of simple neglect of duty due to significant delays in implementing some writs, non-implementation of others, and failure to submit required periodic reports.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Complaint:**  Inefficiency/ineffectiveness in implementing six writs of execution for Asian Hills Bank, specifically citing undue delay and failure to act despite receiving funds.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Claimed counsel directed him to only implement three writs, defendants' insolvency, and ongoing monitoring.
*   **Investigating Judge's Findings:** Receipt of sheriff's fees, late and potentially falsified partial reports, failure to notify parties, lack of record keeping, and unacted upon writs for two years.
*   **OCA Recommendation:**  Found guilty of Inefficiency and Ineffectiveness; P5,000 fine.
*   **Court's Ruling:**  Sheriff found GUILTY of neglect of duty and SUSPENDED for three (3) months.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   Sheriff's ministerial duty to execute writs promptly per Sec. 14, Rule 39, Rules of Court (requiring returns/reports every 30 days).
    *   Respondent's 2-year delay and non-implementation violated this duty.
    *   Failure to submit periodic reports.
    *   Cited *Pesongco v. Estoya* (A.M. No. P-06-213) and *Vda De Escobar v. Luna and Fernandez* (A.M. No. P-04-1786) as relevant case law where similar neglect resulted in suspension.

**Obligations:**

*   Sheriff's *ministerial duty* to execute writs promptly and diligently.
*   Obligation to make periodic reports (every 30 days) per Rule 39, Sec. 14.
*   Obligation to inform parties and the Court about actions taken.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:**  Guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty under Rule IV, Section 52, B 1 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.
*   **Penalty:**  Suspension for three (3) months.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Veracity of Sheriff's Reports:** The Investigating Judge questioned the veracity, raising concerns of falsification, but the Court did not explicitly make a finding on this.
*   **Justification for Selecting Writs:**  The sheriff stated he was instructed by counsel to only implement some writs. The Court doesn't fully address the validity of this defense, focusing instead on non-implementation and reporting failures.
*   **Insolvency Argument:** The Sheriff claims the defendants were insolvent, but there is no discussion on efforts to determine the insolvency or if insolvency existed prior to the neglect of duty.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Sec. 14, Rule 39, Rules of Court:** Defines the Sheriff's duties regarding writ of execution and reporting.
*   **Rule IV, Section 52, B 1 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Defines Simple Neglect of Duty and associated penalties.
*   **Pesongco v Estoya, A.M. No. P-06-213:** (Inefficiency resulted in suspension)
*   **Vda De Escobar v. Luna and Fernandez A.M. No. P-04-1786:** (Failure to implement resulted in suspension)
*   **Reyes v. Cabusao, A.M. No. P-03-1676:** (Delay in implementation resulted in suspension)

**Conclusion:** The case affirms the high standard of diligence expected from sheriffs in executing court orders. The Court emphasized the ministerial nature of the duty and imposed a three-month suspension for neglect due to significant delays, non-implementation, and reporting failures.  This case serves as a precedent for holding sheriffs accountable for inaction and non-compliance with procedural rules regarding writs of execution.
