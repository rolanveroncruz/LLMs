**Legal Document Summary: *Young Scholars Academy, Inc. vs. Erlinda G. Magalong***

**Case:** G.R. No. 264452, June 19, 2024

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' reversal of the Regional Trial Court's decision in a Specific Performance case.

**Key Issue:** Whether a valid contract of sale existed between Young Scholars Academy, Inc. (YSAI) and Erlinda G. Magalong for the sale of real property.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA ruling, finding that no valid contract of sale existed due to a lack of mutual consent on the terms of payment.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Offer to Purchase (May 18, 2015):** Signed by Magalong, states the price as PHP 2,000,000 with PHP 40,000 earnest money. *Ambiguity:* Doesn't specify the manner of payment for the remaining balance.
*   **Magalong's Letter (June 28, 2015):** Requested a lower declared purchase price for tax purposes and specified the remaining balance should be paid via a PNB Manager's Check, constituting a counter-offer. This implies a rejection of any prior presumed agreements on payment methods.
*   **YSAI's Revised Agreement (September 19, 2015):** Proposed payment of capital gains tax in cash and the remaining balance via Manager's Check. Critical element is that acceptance was not communicated to Magalong.
*   **Magalong's Notice of Decline (October 14, 2015):** Explicitly declined YSAI's offer due to a failure to reach a final agreement within the exclusivity period.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1458, New Civil Code:** Defines the contract of sale and its essential elements.
*   **Article 1318, New Civil Code:** Requisites of a contract: consent, object, and cause.
*   **Article 1319, New Civil Code:** Consent manifested by offer and acceptance; qualified acceptance constitutes a counter-offer; acceptance by letter binds the offerer when it comes to his knowledge.
*   **Article 1475, New Civil Code:** Perfection of sale upon meeting of the minds on the thing and the price.

**Case Law:**

*   **Manila Metal Container Corporation v. Philippine National Bank:** Outlines the stages of a contract of sale (negotiation, perfection, consummation) and emphasizes that negotiation is initiated by a certain offer, and that acceptance must be absolute.
*   **Traders Royal Bank v. Cuison Lumber Co., Inc.:** Reiteration that the offer must be certain and the acceptance absolute and unqualified.
*   **Heirs of Gonzales v. Spouses Basas:** Confirmed that the essential elements of contract of sale are consent, determinate subject matter, and price certain.

**Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   **Manner of Payment:** The absence of a clear agreement on the payment method in the initial "Offer to Purchase" is a crucial point of contention. Magalong's subsequent request for a lower purchase price (ostensibly for tax evasion) raises ethical and legal concerns, though not directly adjudicated in the decision.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Because no perfected contract existed, Magalong had no obligation to sell the property and no liability for breach of contract. The return of the earnest money fulfilled her obligation under the terms of the "Offer to Purchase" in the event of a decline.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Tax Implications:** Magalong's request for a lower declared purchase price exposes her to potential tax evasion charges if investigated by the BIR.
*   **Future Litigation:** While this specific performance case is resolved, YSAI could potentially pursue other claims, although success would be unlikely given the Supreme Court's ruling.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision hinges on the lack of *consensus ad idem* regarding the terms of payment. Magalong's counter-offer and subsequent decline effectively negated the possibility of a perfected contract of sale. The ruling is consistent with established jurisprudence on the requirements of offer and acceptance in contract law.
