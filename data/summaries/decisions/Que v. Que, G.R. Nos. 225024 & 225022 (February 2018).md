Okay, here's a summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court decision, tailored for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Carolina Que Villongco, et al. v. Cecilia Que Yabut, et al.* (G.R. No. 225022 and G.R. No. 225024, February 5, 2018)

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision regarding the validity of a stockholder's meeting and subsequent corporate actions.

**Key Issue:** Validity of the January 25, 2014 annual stockholder's meeting of Phil-Ville Development and Housing Corporation due to lack of quorum.  Specifically, the case concerns a family-owned corporation, disputes over share ownership (specifically, the distribution of shares from the estate of Geronima Gallego Que), and the validity of actions taken by a faction claiming to be the duly elected Board of Directors.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's ruling. The January 25, 2014 meeting was invalid for lack of quorum. All acts performed by Cecilia Que Yabut, Eumir Carlo Que Camara, and Ma. Corazon Que Garcia (Cecilia Que et al.) based on their election at that meeting were *ultra vires*.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Quorum Requirement:**  Citing Section 52 of the Corporation Code, the Court reiterated that a quorum requires a majority of the outstanding capital stock.  Section 137 defines "outstanding capital stock" as total shares issued under binding subscription agreements, whether fully or partially paid, excluding treasury shares. The Court rejected the argument that only "undisputed" shares should be counted for quorum purposes. Ubi lex non distinguit nec nos distinguere debemus.
*   **Transfer of Shares and Corporate Records:** The Court heavily emphasizes the importance of recording share transfers in the corporation's stock and transfer book.  Citing Section 63 of the Corporation Code and *Interport Resources Corporation v. Securities Specialist, Inc.* (G.R. No. 154069, June 6, 2016), the Court stated that unrecorded transfers are *not valid* against the corporation. This directly impacts who is considered a shareholder for voting and quorum purposes. The fact that the stock and transfer book was in the possession of a hostile corporate secretary was not a valid excuse for failure to present it as evidence.  Stockholders have a right to inspect corporate books (Section 74) and a remedy under Section 144 of the Corporation Code for refusal of access.
*   **RTC Decision's Invalidity:** The Court agreed with the CA that the Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision declaring the election invalid was deficient under Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution and Rule 36, Section 1 of the Rules of Court because it failed to clearly state the facts and the law on which it was based.  It merely adopted the plaintiffs' allegations without legal reasoning or factual findings. Citing *De Leon v. People* (G.R. No. 212623, January 11, 2016), the SC emphasized that decisions must make clear *why* a party prevailed under applicable law to established facts.
*   **Voluntary Appearance:** Cecilia Que, et al. were deemed to have submitted to the RTC's jurisdiction despite any defects in summons service because they filed a Motion for Extension of Time to File Answer. This constitutes a voluntary appearance. Citing *Carson Realty & Management Corporation v. Red Robin Security Agency, et al.* (G.R. No. 225035, February 8, 2017).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Ongoing Dispute Over Shares:** The Court acknowledges the existence of another case involving the validity of the transfer of the Geronima Gallego Que shares. While this decision resolves the validity of the *election*, the underlying dispute over share ownership remains. The outcome of that separate litigation could ultimately change the shareholding structure.
*   **Ultra Vires Acts:** The declaration that Cecilia Que, et al.'s actions were *ultra vires* creates potential liability for those individuals.  Any contracts entered into, obligations incurred, or dispositions of corporate assets made by them in their "official" capacity after the invalid election are potentially voidable and may give rise to claims for damages.
*   **Corporate Deadlock:** The infighting within the family and the invalidation of the election raises the strong possibility of a corporate deadlock, potentially requiring further judicial intervention to resolve the management impasse.

**Statutory References:**

*   Corporation Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 68), Sections 52, 63, 74, 137, 144.
*   Constitution, Article VIII, Section 14.
*   Rules of Court, Rule 36, Section 1.
*   Interim Rules of Procedure for Intra-Corporate Controversies, Section 5, Rule 6.

**Case Law References:**

*   *Carson Realty & Management Corporation v. Red Robin Security Agency, et al.* (G.R. No. 225035, February 8, 2017).
*   *De Leon v. People* (G.R. No. 212623, January 11, 2016).
*   *Interport Resources Corporation v. Securities Specialist, Inc.* (G.R. No. 154069, June 6, 2016).

**Conclusion:**

This decision emphasizes the importance of strict adherence to the Corporation Code, particularly regarding recording share transfers. It also serves as a reminder to lower courts regarding the constitutional requirements for clearly articulating the factual and legal bases for their decisions. The declaration of *ultra vires* acts creates potential liabilities and the underlying share ownership dispute remains a significant factor.
