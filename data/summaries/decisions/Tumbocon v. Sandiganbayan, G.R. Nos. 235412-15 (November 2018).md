**Case Summary: *Eldred Palada Tumbocon v. Sandiganbayan***

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing Sandiganbayan Resolutions denying petitioner's Motion to Dismiss criminal cases (Perjury) due to inordinate delay.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversing the Sandiganbayan and dismissing the criminal complaint.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Constitutional Right to Speedy Disposition of Cases (Section 16, Article III, Constitution):** The central issue is whether the Ombudsman violated the petitioner's right to a speedy disposition of his case.
*   **Inordinate Delay:** The Court found inordinate delay based on the totality of circumstances, not merely a mathematical calculation of time elapsed. Delay factors considered were laid out in *People v. Sandiganbayan* and the 4 fold balancing test.
*   **Perjury Charges (Article 171 (4) and 172 RPC):** The charges stemmed from alleged untruthful statements in the petitioner's Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) with respect to a real property, motor vehicle, and business interest.
*   **Republic Act 1379, RA 3019, and Code of Conduct for Public Officials:** These laws were cited in the initial complaint but not directly tied to the final perjury charge.

**Timeline & Delay:**

*   Anonymous complaint filed: 2007
*   Formal complaint filed: August 28, 2009.
*   Preliminary Investigation initiated: April 6, 2010.
*   Probable cause found: March 11, 2013.
*   Ombudsman Approval: December 22, 2014.
*   Motion for Reconsideration denied: June 4, 2015.
*   Informations filed: January 23, 2017.

**Court's Reasoning:**

*   **Exclusion of Fact-Finding Period:** Court followed *Cagang v. Sandiganbayan* in excluding the 2-year fact-finding investigation from the delay calculation.
*   **Unreasonable Preliminary Investigation:** The 5 years, 3 months, and 24 days taken to conclude the preliminary investigation and for the Ombudsman to approve the resolution, for a simple perjury case, was considered inordinate. It exceeded the reasonable period of ninety days.
*   **Post-MR Delay:** The 1 year, 7 months, and 19 days taken to file the Informations *after* the Motion for Reconsideration was denied was also deemed unreasonable.
*   **Prejudice to the Accused:** The Court found the cumulative delay prejudicial, citing *Angchangco v. Ombudsman*, and violating the petitioner's right to speedy disposition. The passage of time impaired his ability to defend himself.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article III, Section 16 (Speedy Disposition)**
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Articles 171 and 172 (Perjury)**
*   **Republic Act No. 1379 (Forfeiture of Unlawfully Acquired Property)**

*   ***Casiano A. Angchangco, Jr., v. The Hon. Ombudsman***

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity in "Inordinate Delay":** The determination of inordinate delay is fact-specific, creating potential for inconsistent application.
*   **Ombudsman's Discretion:** The case highlights the importance of efficient case management by the Ombudsman, as delays can lead to dismissals.
*   **Balancing Test Application:** The weight given to each factor in the balancing test can be debated, potentially leading to different outcomes based on the specific judge or court.
*   **No Specific Deadlines:** There are no clearly defined, legally binding deadlines for the Ombudsman to complete investigations, leaving room for argument.

**Conclusion:** This case provides a strong precedent for dismissing cases due to inordinate delay, even if the individual periods of delay might seem reasonable when viewed in isolation. It emphasizes the importance of timely resolution of cases, especially those involving relatively simple issues.
