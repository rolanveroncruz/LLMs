**Case:** *Francisco G. Calma vs. Arsenio Santos, et al.*, G.R. No. 161027, June 22, 2009 (608 Phil. 155)

**Summary:** This case involves a dispute over the "Calangain Fishpond," co-owned by the Santos family. Petitioner Calma claims ownership of several pro indiviso shares through purchases from various Santos heirs. The core issues are the validity of a deed of sale from Celestino Santos (the original owner) to Arsenio Santos, the right of legal redemption of other co-owners, and unpaid rental obligations.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Validity of Celestino's Sale to Arsenio:** The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale from Celestino Santos to Arsenio Santos. As a notarized document, it carried a presumption of regularity which Calma failed to overcome with clear and convincing evidence. *Relevant Case Law:* The court cited established jurisprudence regarding the evidentiary weight of notarized documents and the burden of proof to rebut their validity (*Abadiano v. Martir, St. Mary's Farm, Inc. v. Prima Real Properties, Inc., Baylon v. Almo, Dailisan v. Court of Appeals*).
*   **Right of Legal Redemption:** The Court of Appeals decision giving some of the Santos heirs the right to redeem the shares sold to Calma was upheld due to his failure to convincingly demonstrate the co-owners had been notified in writing of the sales as required by Article 1623 of the Civil Code. *Relevant Statutory Reference:* Article 1623 of the Civil Code outlines the requirements for legal redemption by co-owners. The court cited *Aguilar v. Aguilar* and *Si v. Court of Appeals* regarding the requisites for the exercise of legal redemption by a co-owner. Although actual notice may obviate written notice, Calma's evidence was insufficient. His counsel was deemed not an independent witness.
*   **Unpaid Rentals:** Calma was ordered to pay Arsenio Santos unpaid rentals of P420,000.00, plus legal interest, as he acknowledged a lease agreement.
*   **Double Sale:** The Court addressed a situation where Leonardo Santos sold the same property twice, first to Arsenio Santos, then to Calma.  The SC applied Article 1544 of the Civil Code (double sale rule), prioritizing Arsenio Santos' claim because he registered his deed first in good faith.
*   **Partition Action:** The court effectively blocked the partition action unless the Santos family failed to execute their right of redemption.

**Obligations:**

*   Dominador and Leticia Santos are ordered to execute deeds of sale for their OWN shares, separate from Celestino's.
*   Certain Santos heirs (Encarnacion, Arcadio, Feliza, Federico, Alfredo, Dominador, and Leticia) are required to reimburse Calma the purchase price related to Celestino's share.
*   Leonardo Santos is ordered to reimburse Calma for the amount received for the double sale of Leonardo’s share.
*   The Santos heirs now have an obligation to execute their right of legal redemption over certain purchased shares upon finality of the decision.
*   Calma is obliged to execute the necessary deeds of reconveyance upon the Santos family executing their legal right of redemption.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation of Redemption Price:** The judgment mandates redemption at the original consideration, but potential appreciation of the property value is not addressed. This could be contentious.
*   **Proof of Redemption:** The decision should ideally specify the process for providing evidence of the proper exercise of the right of redemption (tender of payment, etc.) within the 30-day period. This could be a future point of contention.
*   **"Own shares" Interpretation:** The decision refers to Dominador and Leticia executing deeds of absolute sale for their "own shares." This may cause ambiguity.
*   **Interest:** The decision states, “with legal interest thereon from October 25, 1989, the date of the filing of the answer, until the said amount shall have been fully paid.” However, the exact rate is not stated and will likely need clarification.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code: Articles 493 (co-ownership), 1544 (double sale), and 1623 (legal redemption).

**Conclusion:**

The SC decision favors the Santos family's ownership position, primarily based on the validity of the deed to Arsenio and the failure of Calma to give the Santos family legal notification of the sale. The partition action is contingent on the heirs’ exercise of the right to redeem. Key areas of future dispute likely involve the redemption process and price.
