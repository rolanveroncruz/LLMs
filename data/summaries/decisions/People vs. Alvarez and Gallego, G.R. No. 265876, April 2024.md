**Case Summary: People v. Alvarez & Galledo, G.R. No. 265876 (April 3, 2024)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction for large scale illegal recruitment under Section 6(l) and (m) of RA 8042, as amended by RA 10022 (Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, as amended).

**Key Provisions & Elements:**

*   **Illegal Recruitment (Sec. 6, RA 8042):**  Any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring workers, including referring, contract services, promising or advertising for employment abroad, undertaken by a non-licensee or non-holder of authority. Promise/offer of employment for a fee is a key indicator.
*   **Large Scale Illegal Recruitment (Sec. 6, RA 8042):** Illegal recruitment committed against three (3) or more persons individually or as a group.  Considered economic sabotage, leading to more severe penalties.
*   **Elements of Illegal Recruitment:**
    1.  Offender lacks valid license/authority to recruit and place workers.
    2.  Offender undertakes activities within the meaning of "recruitment and placement" under Art. 13(b) of the Labor Code or prohibited practices under Art. 34 of the Labor Code (now Sec. 6 of RA 8042).
    3.  (For Large Scale) Offender commits any of the acts of recruitment and placement against three or more persons.
*   **POEA Certification (Rule 132, Sec. 23, Rules of Court):**  A public document that is *prima facie* evidence of the facts stated therein (lack of license/authority).

**Facts:**

*   Alvarez and Galledo promised employment as factory workers in Japan to multiple complainants.
*   Complainants paid processing fees but were not deployed.
*   Prosecution presented POEA certifications confirming the lack of license/authority.
*   RTC convicted the accused; CA affirmed with modifications.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:**  Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of large scale illegal recruitment. Sentence affirmed: life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00 each.
*   **Civil Liability:** Solidary liability to reimburse complainants for actual damages (processing fees). Legal interest of 6% per annum imposed from the finality of the decision.  Amounts: Ditchoson (PHP 16,000.00), Machica (PHP 36,550.00), and Pelegrina (PHP 63,000.00). Moral damages were deleted by the CA for lack of basis.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense of Denial:**  Accused relied on denial, but the courts gave more weight to the positive testimonies of the complainants.
*   **Lack of Receipts:** The absence of official receipts was not fatal to the prosecution. Testimony can suffice. ( *People v. Rios, 871 Phil. 774, 806 (2020)*).
*   **Conspiracy:** Conspiracy established based on the coordinated actions of Alvarez and Galledo (assignment of roles). *People v. Gamboa, 395 Phil. 675, 685 (2000)*
*   **Factual Findings:** The Supreme Court gave deference to the factual findings of the RTC as affirmed by the CA, limiting the scope of review.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8042 (as amended by RA 10022):** Primary law governing illegal recruitment.
*   **Labor Code of the Philippines:** Art. 13(b) relates to the definition of recruitment and placement.

The penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00, along with solidary civil liability to the complainants plus 6% legal interest, were upheld.
