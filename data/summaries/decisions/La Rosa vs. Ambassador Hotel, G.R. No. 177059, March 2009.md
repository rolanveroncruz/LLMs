## Legal Document Summary: *Fe La Rosa, et al. v. Ambassador Hotel*

**Case:** G.R. No. 177059, March 13, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) Decision reversing the National Labor Relations Commission's (NLRC) finding of illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Illegal Dismissal (Constructive and Actual) and Violation of Labor Standards. Alleged Retaliation via Work Reduction/Rotation Scheme.
*   **Background:** Employees (Petitioners) filed complaints against the hotel (Respondent) for violating labor standards. After partial settlement, the hotel implemented a work reduction scheme, allegedly leading to constructive dismissal of some employees and the actual illegal dismissal of one.
*   **Labor Arbiter (LA) Decision:** Found Respondent guilty of illegal dismissal and ordered separation pay + backwages + attorney's fees.
*   **NLRC Decision:** Affirmed the LA decision, directing some employees to return to work without backwages. Held that Petitioners were constructively or actually (in the case of Edgar de Leon) illegally dismissed and awarded them damages. Absolved the manager of any personal liability upon reconsideration.
*   **CA Decision:** Reversed the NLRC, finding no constructive dismissal because Petitioners "simply disappeared from work." Held that the work reduction scheme was a valid exercise of management prerogative due to purported economic losses. The CA also noted Petitioners did not seek reinstatement, thus waiving that remedy. The TRO and PI were granted in favor of the hotel.
*   **Supreme Court (SC) Ruling:** *Reversed* the CA decision and *reinstated* the NLRC decision. The SC held that:
    *   The CA misapprehended facts regarding abandonment and management prerogative.
    *   Respondent failed to prove business reverses to justify the work reduction scheme.
    *   Constructive dismissal occurred due to the sudden and arbitrary work reduction scheme that diminished petitioners' salaries. Cites *Uniwide Sales v. NLRC*.
    *   Respondent failed to prove abandonment by petitioners; the filing of complaints negates abandonment. Cites *Seven Star Textile Company v. Dy* and *Samarca v. Arc-Men Industries, Inc.*
    *   Petitioners *did* pray for reinstatement in their complaints and position paper, fulfilling Article 279 of the Labor Code requirements.
    *   Employees dismissed without just cause and due process are entitled to reinstatement and backwages or separation pay.

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondent Hotel:** Obligated to pay Petitioners separation pay, full backwages (from the date of dismissal), and attorney's fees as determined by the LA and affirmed by the NLRC.
*   **Reinstatement:** Petitioners are entitled to reinstatement, although not explicitly ordered, the remedy follows as a matter of law from the finding of illegal dismissal.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent Hotel:** Liable for illegal dismissal (constructive and actual) and the resulting monetary awards.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement:** The primary risk is enforcement of the judgment against the Hotel. Counsel should investigate the hotel's financial status and assets to ensure the judgment can be satisfied.
*   **Interest:** The monetary awards will continue to accrue interest until fully paid.
*   **Contempt:** Failure to comply with the SC's decision could result in contempt proceedings.
