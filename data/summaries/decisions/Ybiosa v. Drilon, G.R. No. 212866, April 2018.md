## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Fredeswinda Drilon Ybiosa and Alfredo Ybiosa v. Inocencio Drilon* (G.R. No. 212866)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Core Issue:** Jurisdiction over a case involving the annulment of a Deed of Absolute Sale and cancellation of an Original Certificate of Title (OCT) derived from a Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA).

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The Supreme Court (SC) ruled that the Regional Trial Court (RTC) lacked jurisdiction over the case. The primary relief sought was effectively the cancellation of a CLOA, which, under existing laws and regulations (1994 DARAB Rules of Procedure, RA 9700, DAR Administrative Order No. 3, Series of 2009), falls under the *exclusive and original jurisdiction* of the **DAR Secretary**.
*   **Nature of the Land:** The SC noted that the land was originally unregistered public land.  Therefore, any sale by Gabriel Drilon (predecessor in interest) is void absent proof of ownership, which is not the case as petitioners were able to obtain the CLOA.
*   **Annulment of Deed:** The SC set aside the Court of Appeals (CA) decision declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of the Ybiosas void, stating that, absent jurisdiction, the court cannot adjudicate on the validity of the sale, as it did not have proper evidence to base its judgement.
*   **Sale to Inocencio Drilon:** The CA's ruling declaring the sale in favor of Inocencio Drilon valid was also overturned, as it lacked jurisdiction.

**Obligations:**

*   **DAR Secretary:** Obligation to adjudicate disputes involving CLOA cancellation, in this case, resolving the issue of land ownership between the parties.
*   **Inocencio Drilon:** If he wishes to pursue his claim, Inocencio is obligated to refile his case with the DAR Secretary.

**Liabilities:**

*   None explicitly established in this decision.  Any potential liability hinges on the outcome of proceedings before the DAR Secretary.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Property:** Potential loss of ownership by the Ybiosas if the DAR Secretary rules against the validity of their CLOA.
*   **Financial Loss:** Potential financial losses for either party depending on the outcome of the land ownership dispute, considering expenditures on litigation.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Heirs of Santiago Nisperos v. Nisperos-Ducusin*, 715 Phil. 601, 700-703 (2013): Cited to establish that matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform laws fall under the jurisdiction of the DAR Secretary.
* *Morta, Sr. v. Occidental:* Emphasizes the need for an agrarian dispute between the parties for the DARAB to have jurisdiction over a case.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):**  Defines agrarian dispute and governs the jurisdiction of the DAR.
*   **Republic Act No. 9700 (CARPER Law):** Amends RA 6657 and reinforces the DAR Secretary's jurisdiction over CLOA cancellation.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 946**
*   **Presidential Decree No. 815**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The absence of a clear finding of forgery regarding the Deed of Sale to the Ybiosas might be contentious, as the SC merely noted the CAâ€™s conclusion without explicitly affirming or denying the forgery.
*   The SC did not comment regarding the oral sale in favor of Inocencio.
*   The SC dismissed the claims for damages, not having been adequately established.
**Conclusion:**

The SC granted the petition, setting aside the CA decision and dismissing the original case due to lack of jurisdiction in the RTC. The key takeaway is the affirmation of the DAR Secretary's primary and exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving CLOA cancellation, particularly in the absence of an agrarian dispute. This case highlights the importance of filing actions in the correct forum to avoid jurisdictional issues.
