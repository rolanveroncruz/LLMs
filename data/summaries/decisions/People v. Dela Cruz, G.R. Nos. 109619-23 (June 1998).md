## Legal Document Summary: People v. De la Cruz, G.R. Nos. 109619-23

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming with modification the conviction of Laudemar de la Cruz for murder, attempted murder (3 counts), and frustrated murder (modified to attempted murder).

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Court reiterates the trial court's findings on witness credibility are generally upheld unless there are strong and valid reasons to disturb them.
*   **Self-Defense:** Appellant claimed self-defense based on an alleged shootout. The Court rejected this defense because the evidence did not sufficiently prove unlawful aggression on the part of the victims (failure to satisfy the most indispensable element for self-defense). The burden of proof shifted to the accused to prove self-defense.
*   **Treachery:** The Court upheld the trial court's finding of treachery as a qualifying circumstance for murder because the attacks were sudden, unexpected, and afforded the victims no chance to resist or escape. De La Cruz had a gun while his victims did not.
*   **Nighttime:** The Court reversed the trial court's finding that nighttime was an aggravating circumstance. The prosecution failed to prove that the accused deliberately sought the darkness, took advantage of it, or that it facilitated the commission of the crimes by ensuring his non-identification or capture. The locus criminis was well-lit.
*   **Frustrated Murder (Modified to Attempted Murder):** The Court modified the conviction for frustrated murder of Ricardo Fernandez to attempted murder. While Fernandez sustained a gunshot wound, the prosecution did not prove that Fernandez's injuries would have been fatal without timely medical attention. The Court reasoned that de la Cruz did not perform all of the acts of execution to kill Fernandez.
*   **Illegal Possession of Firearms:** De la Cruz was acquitted of the charge of illegal possession of firearms.
*   **Penalties:** The Court affirmed Reclusion Perpetua for Murder. De la Cruz was sentenced to four (4) separate terms of imprisonment ranging from two (2) years and four (4) months of prision correccional, as minimum, to eight (8) years of prision mayor, as maximum, for the four (4) counts of attempted murder. The .45 caliber pistol and ammunitions were ordered forfeited.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Laudemar de la Cruz:** Found guilty and sentenced to reclusion perpetua for murder and multiple terms of imprisonment for attempted murder. Liable for indemnification of P50,000 for the murder victim, P30,400 to the murder victim's heirs representing actual expenses, and actual medical expenses for the attempted murder victims.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Unlawful Aggression:** De la Cruz's failure to prove unlawful aggression was fatal to his claim of self-defense. The court found that there was no proof corroborating De La Cruz's claim that the victims initiated the shooting.
*   **Sentence is severe:** If there is any doubt, it is important to re-evaluate the penalty considering that there was no aggravating circumstance established by the court to warrant reclusion perpetua.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:** Articles 6, 51, 64, 248 (Murder), defining attempted and frustrated felonies, penalties for the crimes.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Application in determining the appropriate penalties for attempted murder.
*   **Case Law:** References to precedent cases such as *People v. Nalangan*, *People vs. Obzunar*, *Jacobo vs. Court of Appeals*, *Ingles vs. Court of Appeals*, *People vs. Zamora*, *People v. Castillo*, *People v. Abrenica*, *People v. Cayabyab*, *People vs. Balderas*, *People vs. Nardo*. These highlight the court's reliance on established doctrines related to witness credibility, self-defense, treachery, and aggravating circumstances.
