## Legal Document Summary: *Societe Internationale De Telecommunications Aeronautiques (SITA) v. Huliganga* G.R. No. 215504

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, seeking to reverse the CA decision granting Huliganga a retirement benefit deficiency.

**Key Issue:** Whether Huliganga, a managerial employee, is entitled to the increased retirement benefits under the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) applicable to rank-and-file employees, despite being excluded from the CBA's coverage.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reversing the CA decision and reinstating the NLRC's dismissal of Huliganga's claim.  The Court held that Huliganga, as a managerial employee, is not entitled to CBA benefits unless an established company practice extends such benefits to managerial employees.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Huliganga's Claim:**  Huliganga argued that SITA had a company practice of adopting new economic benefits from the CBA as amendments to its Employee Regulations manual, entitling him to a higher retirement benefit based on the CBA's coefficient for employees with 25+ years of service.

*   **SITA's Defense:** SITA argued that the CBA explicitly excludes managerial employees and that no established company practice existed to extend CBA benefits to them. SITA also argued against an employer-employee relationship with SITA, INC. and EQUANT.

*   **Labor Arbiter & NLRC Findings:**  Both found that Huliganga failed to prove an established company practice of extending CBA benefits to managerial employees. Article 245 of the Labor Code, which prevents managerial employees from joining labor organizations, was cited as justification.

*   **CA Decision:** The CA reversed the NLRC, finding that a company practice existed based on the affidavit of Delia Beaniza.

*   **SC Ruling & Rationale:** The Supreme Court agreed with the Labor Arbiter and NLRC, emphasizing that factual findings of labor officials are generally binding unless there is grave abuse of discretion or disregard of evidence. The Court found that the CA erred in overturning these findings. To establish a company practice, benefits must be given over a long period of time, consistently, and deliberately, with the employer aware that the employees are not otherwise legally entitled to such benefits. The affidavit of Delia Beaniza, a retired employee, was deemed insufficient to prove an established company practice.  Cites *National Sugar Refineries Corporation v. NLRC, et al.*, 292-A Phil. 582, 594 (1993) and *Philippine Appliance Corporation v. CA, et al.*, 474 Phil. 595, 604 (2004) re: requirements for establishing company practice.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 245 of the Labor Code:**  Ineligibility of managerial employees to join labor organizations.
*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Procedure for appeals to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Definition of "Established Company Practice":** The definition of what constitutes an "established company practice" is fact-dependent and can be litigated. The case reinforces the need for clear documentation of employee benefits and policies.
*   **Competency of Evidence:** The decision highlights the importance of credible and competent evidence to prove a company practice. Affidavits from retirees may be scrutinized for their lack of current knowledge.
*   **Impact on Managerial Employees:**  This ruling reinforces the principle that managerial employees are not automatically entitled to CBA benefits unless there is a clear and established company practice to the contrary.
