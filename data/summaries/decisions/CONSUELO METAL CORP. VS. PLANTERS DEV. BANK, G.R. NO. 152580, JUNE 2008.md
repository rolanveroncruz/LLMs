**Case Summary: Consuelo Metal Corporation vs. Planters Development Bank (G.R. No. 152580)**

**Key Issue:** Validity of Planters Bank's extra-judicial foreclosure of CMC's real estate mortgage and the proper jurisdiction (SEC or RTC) for CMC's dissolution and liquidation.

**Facts:** CMC filed for suspension of payments with the SEC under PD 902-A in 1996. The SEC initially suspended all claims against CMC, then later ordered CMC's dissolution and liquidation, directing the transfer of liquidation proceedings to the RTC. Planters Bank, a creditor, commenced extra-judicial foreclosure. CMC sought to enjoin the foreclosure, arguing it required liquidator consent.

**Court's Ruling:**
The Supreme Court denied CMC's petition.

*   **Jurisdiction:** The SEC had jurisdiction to *order* CMC's dissolution, but the RTC has jurisdiction over the *liquidation* proceedings. RA 8799 transferred jurisdiction over liquidation to RTCs. The SEC's Omnibus Order, directing transfer of liquidation proceedings to the RTC, was correct. Section 5.2 of RA 8799 states: "The Commission shall retain jurisdiction over pending suspension of payments/rehabilitation cases filed as of 30 June 2000 until finally disposed" since CMC's petition was already filed.
*   **Foreclosure Validity:** The Court upheld the validity of Planters Bank's extra-judicial foreclosure. As a secured creditor, Planters Bank had a preference over the mortgaged property under Article 2248 of the Civil Code. The right to foreclose the mortgage is merely suspended upon the appointment of a management committee or rehabilitation receiver or upon the issuance of a stay order by the trial court.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PD 902-A, Sec. 5(d):** Initial basis for SEC jurisdiction over suspension of payments.
*   **RA 8799, Sec. 5.2:** Transfer of jurisdiction over dissolution and liquidation to RTCs.
*   **Corporation Code, Sec. 121:** SEC can dissolve a corp., transferred by RA 8799.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 2248:** Secured creditors have preference over specific mortgaged property.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 39, Sec. 15:** Requirements for foreclosure sale time.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   CMC is liable for its debt to Planters Bank.
*   CMC risks loss of assets through liquidation.
*   Failure to file a new petition for dissolution and liquidation.
*   **Risk:** Challenge to the foreclosure proceedings based on irregularities.

**Case Law Referenced:**

*   **Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court (378 Phil. 10 (1999)):** Secured creditors have preference in liquidation proceedings.
*   **Union Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 164910, 30 September 2005, 471 SCRA 751):** Foreclosure proceedings have a presumption of regularity.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Whether the Omnibus Order directing the dissolution of CMC, is already the final decision that should be followed.
*   Whether the proceeding on and implementation of the order of liquidation should be followed with the SEC or RTC.

**Potential Risks/Further Actions:**

*   Challenges to the proper conduct of the liquidation proceedings.
*   Disputes among creditors regarding priority of claims during liquidation.
*   Potential for legal challenges by other creditors if they believe Planters Bank's foreclosure was improperly conducted.
