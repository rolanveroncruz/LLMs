**Legal Document Summary: Francisco v. COMELEC and Nieto (G.R. No. 230249, April 24, 2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64 (in relation to Rule 65) challenging the COMELEC En Banc's dismissal of a Petition for Disqualification against a re-elected Mayor, Atty. Johnielle Keith P. Nieto, filed by Atty. Pablo B. Francisco.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Disqualification Ground:** Francisco alleged Nieto violated Sec. 261(v) (prohibition on release/disbursement of public funds within 45 days before elections) and Sec. 104 (prohibited donations) of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), Batas Pambansa Blg. 881. The allegations stemmed from asphalt paving of a road entrance along Imelda Avenue of Cainta Green Park Village purportedly paid for using government funds within the prohibited period.
*   **Nieto's Defense:** The asphalting project was subject to public bidding *before* the 45-day period, falling under the exception in Sec. 261(v)(1)(b) OEC. Nieto presented evidence of public bidding, notice of award to Franzcor Trading and Construction. Also, no public funds were disbursed during the ban since all expenses were for the account of the winning bidder.
*   **COMELEC Ruling:** The COMELEC (both 2nd Division and En Banc) dismissed the petition, relying on *Poe-Llamanzares v. COMELEC* (Poe) to require a *prior judgment* from a competent court finding Nieto guilty of an election offense before disqualification. The Court in Poe held that "to disqualify a candidate there must be a declaration by a final judgment of a competent court that the candidate sought to be disqualified "is guilty of or found by the Commission to be suffering from any disqualification provided by law or the Constitution."
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:**
    *   **Procedural Lapse:** The Supreme Court noted that the petition should have been dismissed outright because petitioner failed to comply with the material date rule.
    *   **Jurisdiction of COMELEC and Reversal of Poe ruling:** The Supreme Court declared that **COMELEC has full adjudicatory powers to resolve election contests outside the jurisdiction of electoral tribunals.** It emphasized that the COMELEC has the power to investigate facts, weigh evidence, and draw conclusions, and that COMELEC, as an adjunct to its adjudicatory power, may investigate facts or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings. weigh evidence, and draw conclusions from them as basis for their official action.
    *   **Distinction between Petition for Disqualification vs. Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel COC:**  The Court distinguished between petitions under Sec. 68 (Disqualification) and Sec. 78 (Petition to Deny Due Course) of the OEC.
        *   **Prior Judgment Not Required under Sec 68:** Prior court judgment is not required for disqualification petitions under Sec. 68 OEC. The provision itself contemplates of two scenarios: first, there is a final decision by a competent court that the candidate is guilty of an election offense and second, it is the Commission itself that found that the candidate committed any of the enumerated prohibited acts.
        *   The essence of a disqualification proceeding that invokes Sec. 68 of the OEC is to bar an individual from becoming a candidate or from continuing as a candidate for public office based not on the candidate's lack of qualification, but on his possession of a disqualification as declared by a final decision of a competent court, or as found by the Commission.
        *   The ground imputed on respondent must necessarily be committed within forty-five (45) days before a regular election and within thirty (30) days before a special election.
        *   The Court categorical1y ruled that the COMELEC can be the proper body to make the pronouncement against which the truth or falsity of a material representation in a COC can be measured.
    *   **Failure of Proof:** Despite reversing the COMELEC's reliance on *Poe*, the Supreme Court ultimately *dismissed* Francisco's petition for *lack of substantial evidence* that Nieto committed the alleged election offenses. The Court found Nieto's evidence of public bidding, notice of award, and reporting to COMELEC sufficient to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 261(v)(1)(b) OEC.

**Obligations:**

*   None arising from this particular decision, as the petition was dismissed. However, the decision clarifies the COMELEC's power to adjudicate election contests and that a prior court judgment is not needed for disqualification petitions under Sec. 68 OEC.

**Liabilities:**

*   No liabilities were established against Nieto.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **For Future Candidates and Public Officials:** This case underscores the importance of adhering to election laws, particularly those regarding the disbursement of public funds and prohibited donations during the campaign period. It highlights the need to meticulously document compliance with the OEC's exceptions (e.g., providing evidence of public bidding for projects contracted before the prohibited period).
*   **For Future Petitioners:** The case emphasizes the stringent burden of proof in election cases and the need to present *substantial evidence* to support allegations of election offenses.
*   **For the COMELEC:** The decision clarifies the COMELEC's constitutional authority and responsibility in resolving election contests and that it may make factual determinations as to the eligibility of a candidate.
