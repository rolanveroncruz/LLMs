**Case Summary: People v. Esparas, G.R. No. 120034 (1998)**

**Nature:** Automatic review of death penalty conviction for violation of Section 14, Article III of RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act), as amended by RA 7659 (importing methamphetamine hydrochloride/shabu).

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Accused:** Josefina Esparas (Appellant), Rodrigo Libed (At Large).
*   **Facts:** Esparas and Libed conspired to import 20.09314 kg of shabu. Esparas arrived at NAIA from Hongkong. Libed, posing as having official clearance, attempted to expedite Esparas' luggage through customs. Examiner discovered shabu hidden in false bottoms of luggage. Esparas attempted to flee.
*   **Executive Discretion:** Court affirmed Prosecutor discretion that Esparas would not be a reliable state witness.
*   **Evidence:** Possession of luggage claim tags, Baggage declaration form, attempt to run away from customs.
*   **Organized/Syndicated Crime Group:** Court found sufficient evidence of conspiracy between Esparas and Libed, thus triggering the death penalty enhancement as per RA 7659. Defined as "a group of two or more persons collaborating; confederating or mutually helping one another for purposes of gain in the commission of any crime."
*   **Animus Possidendi:** Court determined that Esparas had intent to possess the drugs, rebuttable presumption of ownership not overcome by her self-serving affidavit, which was deemed inadmissible hearsay. _People vs. Brioso, No. L-28482, Janaury 30, 1971, 37 SCRA 336, 341, cited in People’s Bank and Trust Company vs. Leonidas, G.R. No. 47815, March 11, 1992, 207 SCRA 164, 166._

**Obligations:**

*   Esparas was obligated to comply with customs regulations and the Dangerous Drugs Act.

**Liabilities:**

*   Esparas was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 14, Article III of RA 6425, as amended.
*   Imposed Death Penalty and a fine of P10,000,000.00.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Constitutionality of Death Penalty:** Mentioned but ultimately upheld due to majority vote, despite individual justices' dissenting views based on _People vs. Echegaray (G.R. No. 127472, February 12, 1997)_.
*   **Weight Discrepancy:** While the information stated 20.09314 kilograms, the actual weight proven was 19.94755 kilograms. The Court deemed this a trivial error that did not affect the penalty.
*   **Hearsay Evidence:** Esparas' counter-affidavit claiming Robert Yu owned the bags was inadmissible as hearsay because she did not testify and subject herself to cross-examination.
