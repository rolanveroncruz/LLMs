**Legal Document Summary: *Serdoncillo v. Spouses Benolirao***

**Case:** *Serdoncillo v. Spouses Benolirao*, G.R. No. 118328, October 8, 1998 (358 Phil. 83)

**Nature:** Petition for review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's order for the petitioner to demolish illegal structures, vacate property, and return possession to the respondents.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Property Dispute:** Focuses on Lot 666-H (purchased by Spouses Benolirao) and Lot 666-I (purchased by Carisima) which were subdivided from a larger estate.
*   **Right of Way:** Lot 666-H includes a right of way for Lot 666-I and the residential portion of Lot 666-H.
*   **Petitioner's Claim:** Serdoncillo occupied a portion of the property as a long-term tenant and contested the sale of Lot 666-H to the Benoliraos, claiming a preferential right to purchase.
*   **Prior Actions:**
    *   UCRTC (previous owner) filed an unsuccessful recovery of possession action (Civil Case No. 6652) against Serdoncillo.
    *   Serdoncillo filed an unsuccessful action (Civil Case No. 7749) to annul the sale to the Benoliraos, asserting her right of first refusal.
*   **Current Action (Civil Case No. 7785):** Filed by the Benoliraos for recovery of possession, alleging Serdoncillo constructed illegal structures obstructing their right of way and encroaching on their property.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Favored the Benoliraos, ordering demolition, eviction, and return of possession. Affirmed by the CA.

**Issues & Ruling:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The central issue is whether the action should have been an unlawful detainer case (jurisdiction of inferior court) instead of an accion publiciana/reivindicatoria (jurisdiction of RTC).
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed the CA decision, holding that the complaint (Civil Case No. 7785) constituted an *accion publiciana* or *accion reivindicatoria* because the Benoliraos asserted title (ownership) and sought Serdoncillo's eviction based on that title. The complaint did not allege facts constitutive of forcible entry or unlawful detainer.
*   **Res Judicata:** Serdoncillo argued res judicata based on the previous consignation case (Civil Case No. 5456). The SC rejected this, finding no identity of causes of action. Civil Case No. 5456 was about the propriety of consignation of rentals, while Civil Case No. 7785 was about recovery of possession based on ownership.
*   **Tenancy Claim:** Serdoncillo's claim of tenancy rights was deemed irrelevant to the *accion publiciana* or *reivindicatoria* issue.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Javier vs. Veridiano II (237 SCRA 565 (1994)) and Emilia v. Bado, (23 SCRA 183 (1968)):** Discussed the distinctions between *accion interdictal*, *accion publiciana*, and *accion reivindicatoria*.
*   **Bernabe vs. Luna (148 SCRA 113) and Medina vs. Court of Appeals (181 SCRA 837):** Distinguished as factually dissimilar because, in those cases, the complaints alleged facts constituting either forcible entry or unlawful detainer, whereas the complaint in this case did not.
*   **Banayos vs. Susana Realty, Inc. (71 SCRA 557 (1976)):** Discusses the difference between Forcible entry and unlawful detainer.
*   **Garcia vs. Court of Appeals (14 SCRA 721 (1965)):** Established the test for identity of causes of action in determining *res judicata*.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Encroachment Details:** The specific details of the encroachment (4.1 meters) are mentioned, which suggests a potential boundary dispute that could be further litigated if the demolition and eviction are not precisely executed.
*   **Right of Way Obstruction:**  The CA and RTC findings are based on the obstruction of the right of way, but the exact scope and enforceability of the easement could still be challenged if Serdoncillo argues its improper establishment or maintenance.
*   **Unclear Property Boundaries:** The Ocular Inspection Report notes missing lot boundary monuments, indicating a potential for future disputes regarding precise property lines.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70, Rules of Court (Forcible Entry and Unlawful Detainer):** Relevant to the jurisdictional issue.
*   **Article 613, New Civil Code:** Servitude is an encumbrance imposed upon an immovable for the benefit of another immovable belonging to a different owner.
*   **Section 47, Rule 39, Rules of Court:** Res Judicata.

**Overall Assessment:** The SC affirmed the RTC and CA decisions, finding that the Benoliraos properly brought an *accion publiciana/reivindicatoria* based on their assertion of ownership. Serdoncillo's defenses of tenancy and *res judicata* were rejected.
