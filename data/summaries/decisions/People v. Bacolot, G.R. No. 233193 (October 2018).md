## Legal Document Summary: People v. Bacolot y Idlisan, G.R. No. 233193

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Appeal under Rule 124, Sec. 13)

**Subject Matter:** Criminal Law - Murder (Art. 248, RPC)

**Key Issue:** Whether the accused-appellant, Renato Bacolot, is guilty of murder or homicide in the death of Rodolfo Jabayjabay. The defense argued insanity and the absence of treachery.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court partially granted the appeal, finding Bacolot guilty of **HOMICIDE**, not murder.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Insanity Defense (Art. 12, RPC):** The Court rejected the insanity defense. While Bacolot had a history of mental illness (schizophrenia, diagnosed by Dr. Genotiva of EVRMC), the defense failed to prove that he was completely deprived of intelligence *at the time* or *immediately before* the commission of the crime.  Reference is made to *People v. Isla* (699 Phil. 256) and *People v. Cacho* (G.R. No. 218425) regarding the burden of proof for insanity and the timing of the insanity relative to the offense. The Court noted the accused's voluntary surrender as evidence against a lack of mental capacity and stated that the testimony of Dr. Genotiva failed to show the mental condition of accused-appellant at the time the crime was committed.

*   **Treachery (Art. 14, par. 16, RPC):** The Court overturned the lower courts' finding of treachery. The two prongs of treachery – (1) attack preventing defense and (2) deliberate adoption of means – were not sufficiently proven. The Court noted that the incident occurred during a drinking spree, the weapon belonged to another person, and the attack appeared to be a spur-of-the-moment impulse, not a premeditated act. The element of *alevosia* was not established. *People v. Duran, Jr.* (G.R. No. 215748), *People v. Dulin* (762 Phil. 24), *People v. Escoto, Jr.* (448 Phil. 749), and *Fantastico and Villanueva v. Malicse, Sr. and People* (750 Phil. 120) are cited regarding the definition and application of treachery. *People v. Escoto* (313 Phil. 785) is used for the precedent that treachery cannot be presumed merely from the fact that the attack was sudden.

*   **Homicide (Art. 249, RPC):** With treachery absent, the crime is homicide.  The penalty is *reclusion temporal*.

*   **Voluntary Surrender (Art. 64(2)):** Recognized as a mitigating circumstance, entitling the accused to the minimum period of the penalty. Cites *People v. Endaya, Jr.* (G.R. No. 225745)

*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied to determine the precise penalty.

*   **Damages:** Modified based on *People v. Jugueta* (783 Phil. 806).

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-appellant is obligated to serve the sentence for homicide: an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor*, as minimum, to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal*, as maximum.
*   Accused-appellant is obligated to pay the heirs of the victim: P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages, and P50,000 as temperate damages, all with 6% interest per annum from finality of the decision until fully paid.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for homicide.
*   Civil liability for damages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Burden of Proof of Insanity:** The high standard for proving insanity makes it a difficult defense.
*   **Subjectivity of Treachery Determination:** While the Court overturned the finding of treachery, this element is often highly fact-dependent and subject to judicial interpretation. The defense should be prepared to defend the Court's ruling in the event of future appeals or motions.
*   **Lack of Concrete Evidence:** The verdict hinged significantly on the Court’s interpretation of available facts surrounding the offense.

**Further Investigation:**

*   Examine the trial court records and testimonies, especially Dr. Genotiva's testimony and Arnulfo Jabayjabay's eyewitness account.
*   Review the precedents cited by the Court.
*   Assess potential avenues for challenging the damages award, if any.
