**Case Summary: *First Marbella Condominium Association, Inc. vs. Augusto Gatmaytan*, G.R. No. 163196 (2008)**

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court decision on a petition for review on certiorari (treated as mandamus) regarding the denial of a request for extrajudicial foreclosure by the RTC Executive Judge.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Condominium Act (R.A. No. 4726), Sec. 20:** Grants condominium corporations a lien on units for unpaid assessments, which can be enforced through judicial or extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **Declaration of Restrictions:** Registered on the title, it stipulates the lien for unpaid dues and assessments.
*   **Administrative Matter No. 99-10-05-0 (as amended) & Circular No. 7-2002:** Govern the procedure for extrajudicial foreclosure, requiring a "special power of attorney" authorizing the foreclosure.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondent, Gatmaytan, owes substantial unpaid condominium dues (P3,229,104.89).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Express Authority to Foreclose:** The core issue is whether the mere annotation of the lien for unpaid assessments on the title, coupled with Sec. 20 of R.A. No. 4726, *automatically* grants the condominium corporation the power to extrajudicially foreclose. The Supreme Court held it does *not*.
*   **Challenge to Association's Authority:** Respondent claims a pending litigation challenges the validity of the condominium association's constitution and its authority to assess dues. This could impact the enforceability of the lien.
*   **Procedural Error:** Petitioner initially filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari, which was an improper mode of appeal. The Supreme Court treated the petition as one for mandamus, but ultimately denied it.
*   **Ambiguous language in Sec. 20 of RA 4726**  The phrase  "...such liens may be enforced in the same manner provided for by law for the judicial or extra-judicial foreclosure of mortgage or real property" leaves open the possibility for interpretation as to whether a special power of attorney is required for foreclosure when it comes to the foreclosure of a condominium.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 4726 (Condominium Act), Sec. 20:** Key statutory provision concerning the lien for unpaid assessments.
*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended by Act 4118):** Law governing extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages.
*   **Supreme Court Administrative Matter No. 99-10-05-0 & Circular No. 7-2002:** Procedural rules for extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **Yee v. Bernabe, G.R. No. 141393:** Cited for the rule that only judgments in the exercise of judicial functions are appealable via certiorari.

**Key Holding:**

The Supreme Court held that merely annotating the notice of assessment on the title, pursuant to Section 20 of R.A. No. 4726, does *not* automatically grant the condominium association the authority to extrajudicially foreclose the unit.  The Association must still comply with A.M. No. 99-10-05-0 and provide evidence of a *special power of attorney* authorizing the foreclosure.  Absent such proof, the Executive Judge correctly denied the request for extrajudicial foreclosure.  The court further clarifies that Section 20 only prescribes the procedure to establish a superior lien, but does not grant special power to foreclose.
