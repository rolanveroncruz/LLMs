**Case Summary: *Sinaon, Sr. v. Judge Dumlao* & *OCA v. Judge Dumlao***

**Citation:** 571 Phil. 240 (2008)

**Nature:** Consolidated administrative complaints against Judge Cesar M. Dumlao for Grave Abuse of Authority, Misconduct, Dereliction of Duty, Ignorance of Law (Sinaon complaint) and for failure to comply with directives of the Court to file comment (OCA complaint).

**Facts:**

*   **Sinaon Complaint:** Reynaldo Sinaon, Sr., Chief of Police, filed a complaint alleging Judge Dumlao improperly dismissed criminal complaints against Romeo Vinoya for lack of jurisdiction, asserting the offenses occurred outside San Mateo, Isabela. Sinaon alleged grave abuse, undue favor to the accused, and failure to transmit records per Rule 112, Section 5.
*   **OCA Complaint:** Judge Dumlao failed to comply with multiple directives from the Supreme Court, through the OCA, to comment on the Sinaon complaint and supplemental complaint.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction (Dismissed Charge):** Judge Dumlao dismissed the criminal complaints based on his determination that the offenses occurred outside his territorial jurisdiction (Alfonso Lista, Ifugao). The Court found no ground for disciplinary action despite a potentially erroneous determination of jurisdiction.
    *   **Relevant Rule:** Rule 112, Sec. 2 and 3 (Preliminary Investigation authority of MTC judges)
*   **Failure to Comply with Court Directives (Sustained Charge):** Judge Dumlao's persistent failure to file comments on the administrative complaints, despite multiple notices and opportunities, constitutes a violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars.
    *   **Relevant Rule:** Rule 140, Rules of Court (Violation of SC rules is a less serious charge).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Judges have an obligation to comply promptly and completely with directives from the Supreme Court. *Josep v. Abarquez, 330 Phil. 352, 359 (1996)*
*   Failure to comply with these directives constitutes disrespect for the Court and its lawful orders.
*   Judges have the obligation under oath to administer justice without respect to any person and do equal right to the poor and to the rich (*Pimentel vs. Salonga 21 SCRA 161*).
*   Lack of interest to remain within the judiciary system (*Parane v. Reloza, A.M. No. MTJ-92-718, 7 November 1994, 238 SCRA 1*)

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Abuse of Discretion vs. Error of Judgment:** The dismissal of the Grave Abuse of Authority, Misconduct, Dereliction of Duty and Ignorance of the Law charges underscores the court's reluctance to penalize errors in judgment absent fraud, dishonesty, or corruption. However, repeated errors can contribute to a pattern of behavior and be used to prove misconduct.
*   **Penalty Enhancement:** Prior administrative offenses factored into determining the appropriate penalty for Judge Dumlao's failure to comment. *Lim v. Judge Dumlao, A.M. No. MTJ-04-1556, 31 March 2005, 454 SCRA 196; Morales, Jr. v. Judge Dumlao, 427 Phil. 56 (2002); Pascual v. Judge Dumlao, 414 Phil. 1 (2001).* This highlights the risk of escalating penalties for repeated administrative violations.
*   **Ministerial Duty**: Judge Dumlao's failure to transmit the records to the office of the Provincial Prosecutor per Section 5, Rule 112 was not supported by any document or sworn statement.

**Outcome:**

*   Charges of Grave Abuse of Authority, Misconduct, Dereliction of Duty, and Ignorance of Law were dismissed.
*   Judge Dumlao was suspended for two (2) months without pay for his failure to file a comment, with a warning of more severe penalties for future similar acts.

*   Rule 112, Rules on Criminal Procedure (Preliminary Investigation)
