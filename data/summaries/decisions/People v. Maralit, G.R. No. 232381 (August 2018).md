## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Maralit* (G.R. No. 232381)

**Type:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) judgment finding the accused, Ryan Maralit, guilty of violating Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act).

**Key Issue:** Whether Maralit's guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt, specifically focusing on the preservation of the identity and integrity of the seized marijuana (corpus delicti).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) *denied* the appeal, *affirming* the CA's decision and the RTC's judgment of conviction.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165:**  Maralit was charged with and convicted of illegal trade, transport, delivery, and giving away of dangerous drugs (marijuana).
*   **Chain of Custody:**  The prosecution must establish an unbroken chain of custody to ensure the integrity and identity of the seized drugs. *People v. Kamad* (624 Phil. 289 (2010)) outlines the four links.
*   **Section 21(1) of R.A. No. 9165:**  Establishes procedures for the custody and disposition of seized drugs, including immediate inventory and photographing in the presence of the accused, a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official.  This was amended by R.A. No. 10640, modifying the witness requirements.
*   **Delivery vs. Sale:**  Conviction under Section 5 does not always require proof of a sale (consideration exchanged). Delivery, distribution, or giving away of drugs is a separate and punishable offense. *People v. De la Cruz* (263 Phil. 340 (1990)).

**Liabilities:**

*   Maralit was sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of Php 500,000 for violating Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Absence of DOJ Representative:** The SC acknowledged the non-compliance with the strict requirements of Section 21 due to the lack of a DOJ representative, but excused it due to justifications provided and the presence of other witnesses (barangay officials and media representative).  Reliance on *People v. Sanchez* (590 Phil. 214, 234 (2008)) suggesting flexibility in strict compliance.
*   **The Dissent:** Justice Caguioa's dissenting opinion argued for acquittal, emphasizing the lack of proven consideration (no sale), failure to comply with Sec. 21, and a failure to show justifiable grounds for non-compliance. The dissent also notes the witness not knowing "where the confiscated objects came from" and questions that this poses a risk to the validity of the chain of custody and the evidence obtained. The dissent suggests failure to prove corpus delicti of the offense. This highlights the continued contentious issue of strict compliance with the procedural safeguards in drug cases and the importance of the insulating witnesses.
*   **Chain of Custody Lacunae:**  While the SC found an unbroken chain, the defense could have argued for a stricter interpretation of "immediately" for marking and inventory, especially given the absence of the crucial DOJ representative.
*   **Argument for Sale:** The defense had initially argued lack of consideration as grounds for acquittal; the SC notes this as a moot point given the finding of delivery as a distinct punishable action under Sec 5, Article II, RA 9165.
**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act):**  The primary statute under which Maralit was charged.
*   **R.A. No. 10640:** Amendment to Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 regarding witness requirements for inventory and photographing of seized drugs.
*   **People v. Kamad, 624 Phil. 289 (2010):** Defines the four links in the chain of custody.
*   **People v. De la Cruz, 263 Phil. 340 (1990):**  Establishes that delivery of drugs is a separate offense from sale under R.A. No. 9165.
*   **People v. Sanchez, 590 Phil. 214, 234 (2008):** Permits some flexibility in the strict application of Section 21 in certain circumstances.

**Overall Assessment:**

The SC upheld Maralit's conviction, prioritizing the finding of delivery over strict adherence to procedural requirements, particularly regarding the mandatory witness presence. The dissenting opinion highlights the tension between the need to combat drug offenses and the protection of individual rights, particularly with respect to chain of custody requirements. The continued lack of DOJ representative despite available time may have opened the door for evidence planting. The court appears to be leaning away from *strict* compliance and towards *substantial* compliance given its ruling.
