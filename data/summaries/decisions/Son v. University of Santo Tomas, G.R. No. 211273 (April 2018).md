## Legal Document Summary: *Son v. University of Santo Tomas*, G.R. No. 211273, April 18, 2018

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals' decision upholding the dismissal of probationary faculty members (Petitioners) who failed to obtain a Master's degree as required by University policy and CHED regulations.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Probationary Status:** Petitioners were hired as probationary faculty members conditioned upon meeting university requirements and applicable laws, including possessing a Master's degree.
*   **CBA Tenure Provision (Article XV, Section 1):**  A seemingly conflicting provision in the UST-UST Faculty Union Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) grants tenure after six semesters of satisfactory full-time service, even without a Master's degree after a grace period. **CONTENTIOUS CLAUSE**.
*   **CHED Memorandum Order No. 40-08 (Minimum Faculty Qualifications):** Requires a Master's degree for undergraduate program faculty, aligning with the 1992 Revised Manual of Regulations for Private Schools.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners:** To obtain a Master's degree within the probationary period as a condition for tenure.
*   **University of Santo Tomas (UST):** To ensure faculty meet minimum qualifications as mandated by CHED and DECS regulations, and potentially to honor the terms of the CBA.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:**  Potential loss of employment for failure to meet the Master's degree requirement.
*   **UST:** Potential liability for illegal dismissal if the CBA tenure provision is deemed controlling, and for violating CHED regulations by hiring unqualified personnel.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflict between CBA and CHED Regulations:** The central conflict lies between the CBA provision seemingly granting tenure without a Master's degree and the CHED mandate requiring it.  The court ultimately sided with the CHED Memo, but this tension is a key risk area.
*   **Estoppel:** Petitioners argued UST was estopped from enforcing the Master's degree requirement due to their continued employment despite its absence, and the hiring of other faculty in similar circumstances. The court rejected this argument.
*   **Academic Freedom vs. Security of Tenure:** Petitioners argued UST was using its right to academic freedom to undermine their security of tenure. The court recognized that although a University has the right to chose based on efficiency, it should not use academic freedom to undermine security of tenure.
*   **"Twin-Notice Rule":** Petitioners claimed violation of the "twin-notice rule" (notice of infraction and notice of dismissal with opportunity to be heard).  The Court does not directly address the procedural due process but implies non-renewal of a probationary contract does not necessarily require full due process.
*   **In Pari Delicto:** The Court raised the *in pari delicto* principle, suggesting both parties were at fault, UST for employing unqualified faculty and Petitioners for agreeing to employment knowing they lacked qualifications, creating a risk of neither party being able to claim relief.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code Article 281:** Governs probationary employment.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 232 (Education Act of 1982):** Grants rule-making authority to the DECS (now DepEd) and CHED.
*   **Herrera-Manaois v. St. Scholastica's College, 723 Phil. 495 (2013):**  Reinforces the requirement of a Master's degree for full-time faculty status and government's power to regulate educational institutions to ensure quality.
*   **University of the East v. Pepanio, 702 Phil. 191 (2013):** Similar ruling emphasizing the importance of masteral degree for tertiary education.
*   **Aklan College, Inc. v. Guarino, 556 Phil. 693 (2007):** Clarified the implementing rules and regulations have the force of law.
*   **1992 Revised Manual of Regulations for Private Schools:** States the college faculty members must have a master's degree in their field of instruction.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately sided with UST, affirming the CA's decision. The Court held that the CHED Memorandum Order No. 40-08 and the earlier DECS regulations mandating a Master's degree prevail over the CBA's "tenure by default" provision. Thus, the Petitioners were not illegally dismissed due to their failure to obtain the required Master's degrees, despite their years of service. However, UST was also violating CHED regulations by hiring personnel who lack the requirements, thus the Court finds both parties to be *in pari delicto*.
