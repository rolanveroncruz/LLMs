**Case:** *Paz Samaniego-Celada v. Lucia D. Abena* G.R. No. 145545 (2008)

**Summary:**

This case involves a petition challenging the probate of a will. Petitioner, a first cousin of the decedent Margarita S. Mayores, opposed the probate, alleging (1) failure to comply with the formalities required by Article 805 of the Civil Code, (2) undue influence, and (3) entitlement as legal heir. Both the RTC and the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Respondent, the decedent's lifelong companion, upholding the validity of the will and designating her as executor.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Will Provision:** The will bequeathed specific real properties in equal shares to named beneficiaries (including Respondent) and designated Respondent as the sole executor, waiving the bond requirement.
*   **Executor Duties:** Respondent, as designated executor, has the responsibility to administer the estate according to the will and applicable laws. No bond is required due to the express waiver in the will.

**Liabilities:**

*   There are no apparent liabilities of Respondent related to the validity of the will. Should the probated will be fraudulent, liabilities associated with the disposal of estate will be carried by the beneficiary.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Formal Validity Challenge:** The Petitioner challenged the will based on alleged non-compliance with Article 805 of the Civil Code, specifically regarding the testator signing in the presence of witnesses and uniformity of signatures.
*   **Undue Influence Claim:** Petitioner argued undue influence based on the decedent's dependence on Respondent. While rejected in this case, undue influence remains a common ground for challenging wills.
*   **Heirship Dispute:** Petitioner asserted heirship based on being a collateral relative. This was rejected because the will validly disposed of the property.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 805 of the Civil Code:** Governs the formal requirements of wills. *Specifically, the subscription of the testator at the end of the will in the presence of each credible witness.*
*   **Article 809 of the Civil Code:** Doctrine of liberal interpretation, allowing for defects in the attestation clause if there is substantial compliance with Article 805 and no bad faith, forgery, fraud, or undue influence.
*   **Article 887 of the Civil Code:** Defines compulsory heirs. Since Petitioner and her siblings are not compulsory heirs, they have no claim against the will.
*   **Articles 1009 & 1010 of the Civil Code:** Address intestate succession among collateral relatives, which were rendered inapplicable by the existence of a valid will.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The dispute regarding the number of pages in the attestation clause (stating three pages when the attestation is not a part of the notarial will): The Court resolves this using the doctrine of liberal interpretation under Art. 809.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts, emphasizing that the issues raised by the Petitioner involved questions of fact, which are not reviewable under Rule 45. The Court reiterated the factual findings of the RTC and CA that the will was validly executed, and that there was no undue influence. The Court highlights the evidence presented, including a photo of the testator signing the will, indicating her soundness of mind. The court applied the "doctrine of liberal interpretation" under Art. 809 to overlook the error on the attestation clause.

This case reinforces the principle that factual findings of lower courts, supported by substantial evidence, are binding on the Supreme Court. It also clarifies the application of Art. 809, allowing for minor defects in the attestation clause in the absence of fraud or undue influence. Furthermore, it reiterates that collateral relatives cannot claim inheritance when there is a valid will disposing of the property to other beneficiaries.
