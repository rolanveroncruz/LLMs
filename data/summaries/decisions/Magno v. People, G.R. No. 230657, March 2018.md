## Legal Document Summary - *Angelito Magno v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 230657

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court (SC) granted Angelito Magno's (Petitioner) petition, reversing the Sandiganbayan (SB) decision and reinstating the Regional Trial Court (RTC) order dismissing the criminal case (Multiple Frustrated Murder and Double Attempted Murder) against him for violating his right to a speedy trial under Section 14(2), Article III of the 1987 Constitution.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Violation of Right to Speedy Trial:** SC found the RTC did not gravely abuse its discretion in dismissing the case due to the violation of the right to speedy trial. SC reiterated the 4-factor test from *Tan v. People* (604 Phil. 68 (2009)): (a) length of delay; (b) reason for delay; (c) assertion of right; and (d) prejudice to the defendant.
*   **Length of Delay:** The case was pending for over a decade (May 14, 2003, to Sept. 30, 2013). The prosecution had not completed its presentation of evidence.
*   **Reason for Delay:** SC distinguished between two periods. The initial delays (First Period) were largely attributed to incidents elevated to higher courts (CA, SC) regarding the private prosecutor's appearance and admissibility of evidence (citing *Magno v. People*, 662 Phil. 726 (2011)). However, the SC deemed the significant delay between June 7, 2007, and Sept. 17, 2010 (Second Period), as largely unjustified due to the prosecution's inaction.
*   **Assertion of Right:** Petitioner asserted his right by filing a Motion to Set Case for Continuous Hearing on March 16, 2006, and later a Motion to Dismiss on September 17, 2010.
*   **Prejudice to Defendant:** The lengthy delay prejudiced the petitioner, causing anxiety and expense, contradicting the objectives of the right to speedy trial. SC cited *Coscolluela v. Sandiganbayan* (714 Phil. 55, 61 (2013)) outlining types of prejudice.

**Obligations:**

*   The State has an obligation to provide a speedy trial and avoid vexatious delays.

**Liabilities:**

*   Dismissal of the criminal case for violation of the right to speedy trial.

**Potential Risks:**

*   While the criminal case is dismissed, the ruling is without prejudice to any civil action the private complainants may file. SC cited *Coscolluela v. People* (supra) regarding the possibility of civil liability even after dismissal.
*   The lengthy delays and postponements, particularly the prosecution's inaction during the Second Period, were viewed negatively.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 14(2), Article III of the 1987 Constitution:** Guarantees the right to a speedy trial.
*   **Republic Act No. 6770:**  Refers to the functional and structural organization of the Office of the Ombudsman.
*   ***Tan v. People*** (604 Phil. 68 (2009)): Sets out the four-factor test for determining a violation of the right to a speedy trial.
*   ***Coscolluela v. Sandiganbayan*** (714 Phil. 55, 61 (2013)): Discusses the prejudice to the defendant caused by delays.
*   ***Magno v. People*** (662 Phil. 726 (2011)): Relates to the private prosecutor issue.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ruling that the dismissal of the case is "without prejudice to any civil action" raises the possibility of renewed litigation.
