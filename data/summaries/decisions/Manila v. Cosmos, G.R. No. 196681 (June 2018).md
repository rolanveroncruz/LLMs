## Legal Document Summary: City of Manila v. Cosmos Bottling Corporation (G.R. No. 196681)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Key Issue:** Validity of local business tax assessment by the City of Manila against Cosmos Bottling Corporation (Cosmos) and the propriety of a refund. Focuses on procedural requirements for appealing CTA decisions and the interplay between tax protest and refund remedies under the Local Government Code (LGC).

**Holding:** Affirms the CTA En Banc's dismissal of the City of Manila's petition and the CTA Division's decision ordering the City to refund excess business taxes to Cosmos.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **CTA Appeal Procedure:** Mandates the filing of a Motion for Reconsideration or New Trial with the CTA Division *before* appealing to the CTA En Banc. Failure to do so results in dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. (RA 1125, as amended; CTA Rules, Section 1, Rule 8).
*   **LGC Remedy Election (Assessment):**  Taxpayer facing a local tax assessment may:
    *   Protest the assessment *without* payment (LGC Section 195). If denied or no action, taxpayer can appeal to court (original jurisdiction as confirmed in *Yamane v. BA Lepanto Condominium Corporation* 510 Phil. 750) within 30 days of denial or inaction
    *   Protest the assessment *with* payment (LGC Section 195, 196). Action in court can question assessment and seek refund. Protest letter may serve as refund claim if payment is involved, but judicial action must still be filed *within 30 days* of denial or inaction on the protest.
*   **LGC Remedy Election (Refund):** A taxpayer can file a claim for refund of erroneously or illegally collected taxes (LGC Section 196) within two years from the date of payment, regardless of the prior existence of a protest (although prior protest simplifies arguments in judicial proceeding).
*   **City of Manila Obligations:**
    *   Cannot impose tax under Section 21 of the Revenue Code of Manila if a tax has already been imposed on manufacturers under Section 14 of the same code (double taxation).
    *   Assessments must be based on valid ordinances. Ordinance Nos. 7988 and 8011 were declared null and void due to improper publication (consistent with *Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. City of Manila* 526 Phil. 249 (2006)).
    *   Business tax computation must be based on gross sales or receipts for the *preceding* calendar year (LGC Section 143(a)).

**Liabilities:**

*   The City of Manila is liable to refund Cosmos Bottling Corporation P1,094,786.82, representing excess business taxes collected for the first quarter of 2007.
*   If the City Treasurer of Manila imposes double taxation, the assessment is subject to annulment and refund of unlawfully collected taxes.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Procedural Default:** The City of Manila's failure to file a motion for reconsideration with the CTA Division was a fatal procedural error.  This highlights the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules in tax litigation.
*   **Double Taxation:** The court explicitly held that the imposition of both Section 14 and Section 21 taxes under the Revenue Code of Manila constituted double taxation. This argument is significant and should be carefully considered in other cases involving similar tax structures in Manila or other LGUs. The *City of Manila v. Coca-Cola Bottlers, Inc. (2009)* case is central to this point.
*   **Interplay of Protest and Refund:** The decision clarifies the interplay between Sections 195 and 196 of the LGC. While a refund action can be pursued under Section 196, the presence of a prior assessment and protest significantly impacts the timing of judicial action.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of the 30-day period for filing a judicial action following a tax protest under Section 195 versus the 2-year period for refund claims under Section 196.  The Court clarifies that the 30-day period controls when an assessment exists.

**Conclusion:**

This case is significant because it clarifies important procedural requirements for appealing CTA decisions and provides guidance on the proper application of protest and refund remedies under the LGC. The strict adherence to procedural rules, the prohibition against double taxation, and the clarified timelines for judicial action following a tax protest are all key takeaways.
