**Legal Document Summary: *San Miguel Bukid Homeowners Association, Inc. v. The City of Mandaluyong, et al.***

**Case:** G.R. No. 153653, October 2, 2009 (Supreme Court of the Philippines)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 challenging Court of Appeals (CA) Resolutions dismissing petitioner's certiorari petition.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** San Miguel Bukid Homeowners Association, Inc. (SMBHAI), represented by Evelio Barata (President).
*   **Respondents:** City of Mandaluyong, represented by Mayor Benjamin Abalos, Jr.; A.F. Calma General Construction (Calma), represented by Armengo F. Calma (President).

**Background:**

*   SMBHAI (representing urban poor dwellers) entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the City of Mandaluyong under the City's Land for the Landless Program.  The City purchased lots and transferred them to SMBHAI with a first real estate mortgage.
*   The City then contracted with Calma to construct row houses and medium-rise buildings on these lots for SMBHAI's members within 540 days.
*   Construction stopped before completion, prompting SMBHAI to file a complaint for specific performance and damages against the City and Calma in the RTC.

**Key Provisions/Arguments in the Original RTC Case:**

*   **SMBHAI Claims:** Breach of the MOA and Contract Agreement by the City and Calma. Seeking specific performance, attorney's fees, exemplary damages, and litigation expenses.
*   **City's Defense:**
    *   MOA was abrogated due to SMBHAI's failure to secure a loan from the Home Mortgage and Finance Corporation.
    *   SMBHAI lacked *locus standi* (standing to sue) as it wasn't a party to the Contract Agreement between the City and Calma.
*   **Calma:** Did not file an answer.
*   **SMBHAI's Motion to Declare City in Default:** Argued that the City's Answer was filed by a private counsel, not the City Legal Officer as required by Section 248 of the Local Government Code. SMBHAI considered the Answer an unsigned pleading.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Denied SMBHAI's motion to declare the City in default, citing no "clear obstinate refusal or inordinate neglect."

**Court of Appeals (CA) Proceedings:**

*   SMBHAI filed a petition for certiorari with the CA challenging the RTC's denial of their motion to declare the City in default.
*   **CA Ruling:** Dismissed the petition because the person who signed the Verification/Certification of Non-Forum Shopping "did not appear to be duly authorized." A secretary's certificate submitted later was deemed insufficient.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Dismissed** SMBHAI's petition for certiorari.

**Rationale:**

1.  **Improper Remedy:** The Supreme Court held that the proper remedy for challenging the CA's dismissal was a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, not a petition for certiorari under Rule 65.  Certiorari is only appropriate when there is no adequate remedy at law, which in this case, appeal under Rule 45 was.
2.  **Lack of Authority for Non-Forum Shopping Certification:** The Court affirmed the CA's finding that Evelio Barata (SMBHAI's President) lacked proper authorization to sign the Certification of Non-Forum Shopping for the certiorari petition. The Board Resolution only authorized him to initiate, sign, file and prosecute the *original Complaint for specific performance*, not a separate petition for certiorari. The subsequent Secretary's Certificate was insufficient to cure this defect.
    *   Cites *Fuentebella v. Castro, G.R. No. 150865, June 30, 2006, 494 SCRA 183*
3.  **Forum Shopping:**  The Court implies that a strict interpretation of forum shopping rules is necessary for extraordinary remedies such as certiorari and cited *Tible and Tible Company, Inc. v. Royal Savings and Loan Association, G.R. No. 155806, April 8, 2008, 550 SCRA 562*.

**Key Provisions/Liabilities:**

*   **Local Government Code, Section 248:** Relates to the authorized legal representation of local government units.  At issue was whether the City's private counsel was properly authorized.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65 (Certiorari) and Rule 45 (Appeal by Certiorari):**  Crucial in determining the appropriate remedy.
*   **Rules on Forum Shopping and Verification:** Strict compliance required, especially in petitions for certiorari.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Locus Standi:** The City's argument that SMBHAI lacks standing to sue in the underlying contract dispute remains unresolved.
*   **Authority of Representatives:** This case highlights the importance of precisely defining the scope of authority granted to corporate representatives in board resolutions, especially when litigation is involved.
*   **Section 248 LGC:** The issue of whether the City's legal representation was proper under the Local Government Code was not fully addressed but remains a potential point of contention in the underlying dispute.
*   **Ambiguity in the MOA and Contract Agreement:** The specific terms of the MOA and Contract Agreement regarding completion deadlines, loan procurement, and potential breaches are key to resolving the underlying specific performance claim.

**Case Law:**

*   *Abedes v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 174373, October 15, 2007, 536 SCRA 268* (Regarding requirements for certiorari petitions)
*   *Magestrado v. People, G.R. No. 148072, July 10, 2007, 527 SCRA 125* (Dismissal as final order subject to appeal)
*   *Pasiona v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 165471, July 21, 2008, 559 SCRA 137.*
*   *Fuentebella v. Castro, G.R. No. 150865, June 30, 2006, 494 SCRA 183* (Authority for officers to sign certification against forum shopping for corporate bodies)
*   *Tible and Tible Company, Inc. v. Royal Savings and Loan Association, G.R. No. 155806, April 8, 2008, 550 SCRA 562* (Strict compliance with rules for certiorari).

**Next Steps:**

1.  Analyze the underlying specific performance case, particularly the terms of the MOA and Contract Agreement.
2.  Reassess SMBHAI's standing to sue.
3.  Evaluate the validity of the City's claim that the MOA was validly abrogated.
4.  Determine the impact of Calma's failure to file an answer in the RTC case.
5.  Potentially refile Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 with appropriate Secretary's Certificate.
