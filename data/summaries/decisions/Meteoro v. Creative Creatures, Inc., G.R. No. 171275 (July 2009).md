## Legal Document Summary: *Victor Meteoro, et al. v. Creative Creatures, Inc.* (G.R. No. 171275)

**Nature:** Petition for review on *certiorari* of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision regarding jurisdiction over labor standards claims.

**Key Issue:**  Whether the DOLE Secretary (or Regional Director) or the NLRC has jurisdiction over the petitioners' money claims (unpaid wages, benefits, etc.).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's ruling, holding that the NLRC has exclusive jurisdiction in this particular case.

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 128, Labor Code (as amended by RA 7730):** Grants the DOLE Secretary (or authorized representatives) broad visitorial and enforcement powers to enforce labor standards laws.  This includes the power to issue compliance orders and writs of execution.
*   **Art. 129 and 217, Labor Code:** These articles generally vest jurisdiction over money claims exceeding P5,000 per employee with the Labor Arbiter. The SC clarifies that RA 7730 frees Article 128 from these limitations EXCEPT where Article 128(b)'s *exception clause* applies.
*   ***Exception Clause (Art. 128(b), Labor Code):***  Divests the DOLE Secretary/Regional Director of jurisdiction where:
    *   The employer contests the findings of the labor regulations officer.
    *   Resolving the contested issues requires examining evidentiary matters *not verifiable in the normal course of inspection*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Initial DOLE Order:**  The Regional Director initially ordered Creative Creatures, Inc. (CCI) to pay the petitioners P2,694,709.00 for various unpaid benefits. This order was deemed invalid due to lack of jurisdiction.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship Dispute:**  The core of the jurisdictional issue lies in the respondent (CCI)'s persistent claim that the petitioners were not employees, but rather independent contractors/freelancers. This dispute triggers the *exception clause*.
*   **Verifiability of Evidence:** The SC emphasizes that the key factor is whether the evidence needed to resolve the employer-employee relationship issue is *verifiable in the normal course of inspection*.  While some evidence (e.g., contracts) might be, the respondent's claims about outside work and abandonment necessitate a more thorough examination.
*   **"Contesting" the Findings:** The SC clarifies that merely raising lack of jurisdiction is insufficient to trigger the *exception clause*. The employer must actively contest the findings regarding violation of labor standards or the right to benefits *and* raise issues requiring evidence beyond a standard inspection.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Servando's Inc. v. Secretary of Labor and Employment (G.R. No. 85840):**  Initially limited the DOLE Secretary's power, but was later deemed inapplicable due to RA 7730 and subsequent jurisprudence.
*   **Guico, Jr. v. Quisumbing, Allied Investigation Bureau, Inc. v. Sec. of Labor, Cirineo Bowling Plaza, Inc. v. Sensing:** These cases clarify that Articles 129 and 217 do not restrict the DOLE Secretary's visitorial powers, UNLESS the *exception clause* is met.
*   **Bayhaven, Inc., et. al. v. Abuan, et.al., Ex-Bataan Veterans Security Agency, Inc. v. Laguesma, Batong Buhay Gold Mines, Inc. v. Sec. Dela Serna, SSK Parts Corporation v. Camas:** These cases define and reiterate the elements and application of the *exception clause* in Article 128(b).

**Conclusion:**

Because Creative Creatures, Inc. consistently disputed the existence of an employer-employee relationship and the resolution of that dispute required evidence beyond a routine inspection, the DOLE Secretary and Regional Director lacked jurisdiction. Since the petitioners also filed an illegal dismissal case with the NLRC, the CA was correct in ruling that the jurisdictional issue was being addressed there.
