## Legal Document Summary: *Zarcilla v. Quesada, Jr.* (A.C. No. 7186)

**Type:** Disbarment proceedings against Atty. Jose C. Quesada, Jr.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Falsification Allegation:** Complainants alleged Atty. Quesada notarized a falsified Deed of Sale and Joint Affidavit, making it appear that deceased spouses sold property.  However, the Court declined to rule on the falsification itself, requiring prior determination in a separate civil or criminal case (citing *Flores-Salado v. Villanueva, Jr.*, A.C. No. 11099).
*   **Violation of Notarial Law:** The Court *did* find Atty. Quesada violated notarial law by notarizing the Deed of Sale and Joint Affidavit when the supposed signatories were already deceased, referencing Section 2(b) of Rule IV of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. This requires personal appearance and identification. The Court argued this was not mere negligence, but a deliberate misrepresentation.
*   **Disobedience to Court Orders:** Atty. Quesada repeatedly failed to comply with SC Resolutions to file a comment, ignoring notices, directives, and fines for over 5 years. It took a warrant of arrest for him to comply.
*   **Grounds for Disbarment:** The court found Gross Misconduct and willful disobedience of lawful orders under Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court and gross violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Original Charges:** Notarizing documents without affiant's personal appearance
*   **Direct Consequence:** Gross disrespect to the judiciary by ignoring SC directives.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** Complainant has the burden to prove allegations by substantial evidence, but the primary complainant, Zarcilla, died in 2005.
*   **Falsification Determination:**  The court explicitly avoided ruling on the underlying falsification charge, requiring a separate legal proceeding. If a court later determines the documents were *not* falsified, the disbarment based on the notarization of the documents while the signatories were deceased could be challenged.
*   **Mitigating Factors:** The Court explicitly rejected mitigating factors (political harassment) and found no good faith compliance, despite Atty. Quesada's late filing.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 27, Rule 138, Rules of Court:**  Grounds for disbarment (willful disobedience).
*   **Section 2(b), Rule IV, 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice:** Personal appearance requirement for notarization.
*   ***In re Almacen***: Disbarment is *sui generis*.
*   ***Flores-Salado v. Villanueva, Jr.***: Falsification cannot be determined in disbarment proceedings absent a prior separate proceeding.
*   ***Agbulos v. Atty. Viray***: Duties of a notary public.
*   ***Vda. de Rosales v. Atty. Ramos***: Importance of notarization.
*   ***Dela Cruz v. Atty. Dimaano, Jr.***: Verification of signatures during notarization.
*   ***Santeco v. Atty. Avance***: Upholding dignity of court by obeying orders
*   ***Sebastian v. Atty. Bajar***: Compliance with Court orders
*   ***In Re: Resolution dated August 14, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 94656 v. Martel***: Court Orders are not a mere request

**Conclusion:**

Atty. Quesada was disbarred based primarily on his repeated and willful disobedience to Supreme Court orders, compounded by his violation of notarial law. While the initial complaint stemmed from alleged falsification, the disbarment was not directly predicated on a finding of falsification, but rather on the notarization itself given that the named affiants were deceased. The primary risk going forward for Atty. Quesada will be the near impossibility of overturning the ruling, given his lack of cooperation and repeated flaunting of the court's authority.
