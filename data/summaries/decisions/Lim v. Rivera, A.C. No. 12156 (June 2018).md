**Case Summary: *Paulino Lim v. Atty. Socrates R. Rivera*, A.C. No. 12156, June 20, 2018 (833 Phil. 609)**

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Atty. Rivera for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) due to issuing a worthless check.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Loan and Guarantee Check:** Atty. Rivera borrowed P75,000 from Lim, issuing Union Bank Check No. 0003405780 as a guarantee.
*   **Dishonored Check:** The guarantee check was dishonored due to "Account Closed."
*   **Unpaid Debt:** Rivera failed to pay despite demand, leading to the administrative complaint. He did not respond to IBP notices or appear at hearings.
*   **IBP Findings:** The IBP found Rivera liable for violating Rule 1.01 of the CPR ("A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct"). Recommended 1-year suspension and restitution of P75,000 with legal interest.

**Court's Holding:**

*   **Guilty of Misconduct:** The Supreme Court affirmed the IBP's finding of guilt, holding Rivera violated Rule 1.01 and the Lawyer's Oath.
*   **Suspension:** Rivera is suspended from the practice of law for one (1) year. Citing *Lao v. Medel*, *Rangwani v. Dino*, and *Enriquez v. De Vera*.
*   **No Restitution in Administrative Case:** The Court reversed the IBP's order for restitution, citing *Tria-Samonte v. Obias*. Civil liabilities arising from private transactions are beyond the scope of lawyer disciplinary proceedings.
*   **Failure to Respond:** The court emphasized the importance of a lawyer responding to IBP investigation orders. A lawyer who does not respond shows despiciency for the oath of office in violation of Section 3, Rule 138, Rules of Court, citing *Sanchez v. Torres*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Rivera is obligated to comply with the suspension order, inform all relevant courts and quasi-judicial bodies where he has appearances.
*   Civil liability for the unpaid debt remains, but must be pursued in a separate civil action.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Dishonesty:** Issuing a worthless check is considered dishonest conduct that could impact a lawyer's reputation and trust within the profession.
*   **Neglect of IBP Proceedings:** Failure to respond to IBP inquiries can result in more severe disciplinary actions.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 Implication:** While a criminal conviction is not required for administrative sanctions, issuing a worthless check violates Batas Pambansa Blg. 22, demonstrating indifference to public interest.
*   **Ambiguity:** The specific circumstances of the loan and the relationship between the parties are not extensively detailed, leaving room for interpretation regarding intent and knowledge.
*   **Lack of IBP Defense:** The case was heard *ex parte* due to Atty. Rivera's failure to participate, preventing him from presenting a defense or mitigating circumstances.
