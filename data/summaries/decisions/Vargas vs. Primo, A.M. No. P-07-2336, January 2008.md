**Case Summary: Vargas v. Primo, A.M. No. P-07-2336, January 24, 2008 (566 Phil. 318)**

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Sheriff Noel G. Primo for gross disobedience, gross dereliction of duty/gross negligence, usurpation of court's functions, and grave abuse of discretion relating to the execution of a judgment in CV Case No. 186-0-97 (Fidela Y. Vargas v. Sps. Salvacion Yap-Lee).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   Complainant Vargas, as the prevailing party, alleges that Sheriff Primo failed to diligently execute the writ of execution issued by RTC Branch 72 Olongapo City.
*   Specific allegations include: failing to accurately report service date to the Defendant, failing to require proof of rental payments, failing to serve order to vacate, failing to levy on property, and causing unauthorized BIR deductions.
*   Respondent Sheriff Primo claimed his actions were justified by the pending Motion for Reconsideration filed by Lee in the civil case and Lee's willingness to pay.
*   Respondent partially satisfied the judgment amount with the deposit of P57,800.00.

**Findings:**

*   The Supreme Court found Sheriff Primo GUILTY of neglect of duty.
*   The Court cited Primo's failure to execute the writ with reasonable celerity and promptness, particularly his deferral of the notice to vacate due to a pending Motion for Reconsideration.
*   The Court emphasized a sheriff's ministerial duty to execute writs absent a restraining order, citing *Punzalan v. Macalisang, A.M. No. P-06-2268, November 27, 2006* and *Zarate v. Untalan, A.M. No. MTJ-05-1584, March 31, 2005*.
*   Court referenced prior offenses (Grayda v. Primo, OCA v. Labitag, Montemayor v. Primo) for which the Sheriff was sanctioned.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   Primo was SUSPENDED for six (6) months without pay.
*   A STERN WARNING was issued regarding future conduct.
*   The decision acknowledged that dismissal from service would be the correct penalty based on the rules but opted for suspension due to humanitarian reasons and absence of bad faith.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The decision indicates the penalty was tempered due to 'humanitarian reasons and absence of bad faith'. This could be seen as a lenient approach, which could encourage similar acts.
*   The fact that the sheriff deferred actions based on a pending motion for reconsideration, while deemed incorrect here, could be a point of contention, if the sheriff believed he was acting in good faith to avoid potentially unnecessary actions.
*   The amount the Plaintiff stated she deposited was not sufficient to satisfy the Judgement. The Respondent claims that it was improper for him to levy on any of Lee's property, because the latter showed willingness to render payment of the judgment amount. This willingness, may not exculpate him from the charges, as he is sworn to his duties as Sheriff, rather than simply agreeing to the Defendant.

*   Rules of Court (Execution of Judgments)
*   Memorandum Circular No. 19, s. 1999 (Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service), Sec. 52, B.1.
