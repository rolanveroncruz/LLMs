## Legal Document Summary: *Rodolfo M. Yumang, Cynthia V. Yumang and Arlene Tabula vs. Atty. Edwin M. Alaestante* and *Berlin V. Gabertan and Higino Gabertan vs. Atty. Edwin M. Alaestante* (A.C. No. 10992 & A.C. No. 10993)

**Nature:** Consolidated administrative cases for disbarment against Atty. Edwin M. Alaestante.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Conflict of Interest:** Atty. Alaestante represented both sides of a legal issue. He initially filed a complaint (syndicated estafa, qualified theft, and grave threats) against complainants (Gabertans) with the DOJ and then later prepared their counter-affidavit in the same case. This violates the prohibition against representing conflicting interests, even in unrelated cases (*In Re Dela Rosa, 27 Phil. 258; Lim et al. vs. Villorosa A.C. 5303 June 15, 2006; Artezuela vs. Madferazo, A.C. No. 4354 April 22, 2002*). The Court cites *Pacana, Jr. v. Atty. Pascual-Lopez (611 Phil. 399 (2009))* emphasizing that lack of formal agreement does not negate lawyer-client relationship if advice is sought and received. Absence of fees does not excuse conflicting interests *Castro-Justo v. Atty. Galing, 676 Phil. 139, 144 (2011), citing Buted v. Atty. Hernando, 280 Phil. 1, 8 (1991)*
*   **Violation of Rule 8.01, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Atty. Alaestante wrote a letter to the DOJ Secretary containing "scurrilous statements" against the Yumangs, including allegations of "material wealth and tremendous political clout" intending to influence the case and malign their reputation. This constitutes abusive and improper language.
*   **Disregard for Rules of Procedure:** Atty. Alaestante directly sought intervention from the DOJ Secretary, bypassing established procedures for legal and judicial processes.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   Lawyer's Oath
*   Code of Professional Responsibility: specifically, Rule 8.01 (abusive language) and canons related to conflict of interest and maintaining client confidentiality.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative sanction of suspension from the practice of law.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Privileged Communication Defense:** Atty. Alaestante claimed his letter to the DOJ was privileged. The court found this defense unpersuasive, affirming the Pasig City Prosecutor's Office's determination that the letter was not made in the course of judicial proceedings.
*   **Factual Disputes:** Atty. Alaestante denied representing the Gabertans in the criminal case, contradicting documented evidence (preparation of counter-affidavit and payment via check).
*   **Penalty:** The court adopted the Investigating Commissioner's recommendation: a six-month suspension for the libelous letter (A.C. No. 10992) and a one-year suspension for the conflict of interest (A.C. No. 10993). The suspensions are to be served successively.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *In Re Dela Rosa, 27 Phil. 258*
*   *Lim et al. vs. Villorosa A.C. 5303 June 15, 2006*
*   *Artezuela vs. Madferazo, A.C. No. 4354 April 22, 2002*
*   *Pacana, Jr. v. Atty. Pascual-Lopez, 611 Phil. 399 (2009)*
*   *Castro-Justo v. Atty. Galing, 676 Phil. 139, 144 (2011), citing Buted v. Atty. Hernando, 280 Phil. 1, 8 (1991)*
*   *Gonzales v. Cabucana, Jr., 515 Phil. 296, 304 (2006)*

**Statutory References:**

*   Code of Professional Responsibility

**Ambiguities/Contentions:**

*   Respondent's denial of attorney-client relationship despite evidence suggesting otherwise.
*   The nature of the letter to the DOJ as either a protected communication or a libelous statement.

**Overall:** Atty. Alaestante's actions demonstrate a serious lapse in professional ethics and a disregard for established legal procedures, warranting disciplinary action. The conflict of interest and use of inflammatory language are the primary bases for the suspension.
