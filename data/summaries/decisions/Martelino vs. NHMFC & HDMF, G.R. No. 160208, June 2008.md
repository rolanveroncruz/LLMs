**Legal Document Summary: *Martelino v. National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation*, G.R. No. 160208, June 30, 2008**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a petition for declaratory relief and prohibition filed by homeowners against NHMFC and HDMF.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Homeowners' Claim:** Petitioners sought a declaration that their right to suspend amortization payments to a subdivision developer (Shelter) due to non-completion extended to the NHMFC and HDMF, who directly released loan proceeds to the developer. They also sought to halt foreclosure proceedings and avoid interest/penalties during suspension.
*   **Respondents' Obligations:** Petitioners alleged the NHMFC and HDMF had a duty to ensure Shelter completed the subdivision. They also allege the banks acted in bad faith by releasing the proceeds despite the incompletion.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Potential Liability of HDMF:** HDMF could be liable if they failed to consider justifiable reasons for the non-payment of monthly amortization.
*   **Foreclosure Rights:** The HDMF could not be faulted for exercising its right to foreclose the mortgages under the provisions of Act No. 3135 as amended by Act No. 4118.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Forum Shopping:** The NHMFC originally alleged forum shopping based on pending HLURB cases. While the Court ultimately found this claim unsubstantiated, it is a risk to consider.
*   **Breach of Contract/PD 957:** The Court found that the action for declaratory relief was improper, indicating that the petitioners' actual suspension of payments defeated the purpose of the action.
*   **Laches:** Petitioners did not act promptly in requesting relief. Rather than seeking condonation of penalties and restructuring their loans.
*   **Non-compliance:** Borrowers failed to apply with the HDMF and squarely raise their refusal to pay amortizations because of the defective subdivision - a justifiable reason according to the rules

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 957 (The Subdivision and Condominium Buyers' Protective Decree):**  Specifically, Section 23 regarding the non-forfeiture of payments. The core of the dispute revolves around the interpretation and applicability of this section.
*   **Republic Act No. 8501 (Housing Loan Condonation Act of 1998):**  This statute allows for condonation of loan penalties under certain circumstances and gives HDMF the power to condone such penalties.
*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended by Act No. 4118):**  Deals with the extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1344:**  Defines the exclusive jurisdiction of the HLURB.
*   ***Tambunting, Jr. v. Sumabat, G.R. No. 144101, September 16, 2005, 470 SCRA 92***This case sets out that the purpose of an action for declaratory relief is to secure an authoritative statement of the rights and obligations of the parties under a statute, deed, contract, etc. for their guidance in its enforcement or compliance and not to settle issues arising from its alleged breach. It may be entertained only before the breach or violation of the statute, deed, contract, etc. to which it refers.
*   **Rule 58, Section 5, Rules of Court:**  Prohibits preliminary injunctions without notice and a hearing.
*   **Rule 63, Section 1 & 6, Rules of Court:** Governs actions for declaratory relief and the potential for conversion to an ordinary action.
*   ***De La Llana, etc., et al. v. Alba, etc., et al.,*** The court may treat an erroneously entitled petition for declaratory relief and/or for prohibition as an action for prohibition.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Applicability of Suspension Right:** The central issue is whether the right to suspend payments to the developer extends to the mortgagees (NHMFC & HDMF). The Court ultimately ruled that the homeowners' actual suspension of payments rendered the action for declaratory relief improper.
*   **HDMF Notice of Injunction Hearing:** Whether or not the HDMF received proper notice of the preliminary injunction hearing. The Court determined that the HDMF did not receive proper notice.
*   **Propriety of Dismissal:** The Court found it was proper for the court to dismiss the case.
*   **HLURB Jurisdiction:** Whether the HLURB, rather than the RTC, had jurisdiction over the matter. The Court held that a petition specifically seeking a judicial declaration that petitioners' right to suspend payment to the developer for failure to complete the subdivision also applies to respondents who provided them housing loans and released the proceeds thereof to the developer although the subdivision was not completed.
*   **Vagueness of the Petition:** The Court of Appeals agreed with the RTC ruling that the vagueness of the petition furnished additional justification for its dismissal.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' dismissal because the petitioners sought declaratory relief *after* breaching their loan agreements by suspending payments. The proper remedy would have been to seek condonation of penalties from the HDMF under RA 8501.
