## Summary of A.M. No. P-07-2363 (Concerned Court Employee vs. Atty. Vivian V. Villalon-Lapuz)

This administrative matter concerns Atty. Vivian V. Villalon-Lapuz, a Clerk of Court, charged with unauthorized practice of law and insubordination.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Authorization to Practice:** Respondent was granted permission in A.M. No. 98-7-217-RTC to represent her family in Civil Case No. 86-38066, subject to filing leave of absence for hearings and not using official time for case preparation.
*   **Violation of Conditions:** Respondent attended 18 court hearings without filing the required applications for leave of absence, violating the terms of the authorization granted by the Supreme Court.
*   **Defense:** Respondent claimed her superior allowed her to compensate for absences by working beyond office hours, that she did not use official time, that she received no remuneration, and that she was acting on a promise to her late father and helping her impoverished mother.

**Obligations:**

*   Respondent had a clear obligation under A.M. No. 98-7-217-RTC to file applications for leave of absence when attending hearings for her private case. The Supreme Court resolution granting the permission was not a mere request, citing *Cojuangco, Jr. v. Palma, A.C. No. 2474, 30 June 2005, 462 SCRA 310.*.
*   As a court employee, Respondent was required to adhere to high ethical standards, citing *Yrastorza v. Latiza, 462 Phil. 145 (2003).*

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondent was found guilty of **insubordination**.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Respondent's actions constituted a less grave offense under Civil Service Law.
*   While suspension was the typical penalty for first-time offenders (*Rule IV, Section 52(B)(5) of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service*), the court imposed a **fine of P10,000** due to her resignation and mitigating circumstances (first-time offender, 10 years of service).
*   The fine may be deducted from any benefits Respondent is entitled to after resignation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **A.M. No. 98-7-217-RTC:** Supreme Court resolution granting permission to practice, subject to conditions.
*   **Cojuangco, Jr. v. Palma, A.C. No. 2474, 30 June 2005, 462 SCRA 310.:** A Court's Resolution is "not to be construed as a mere request, nor should it be complied with partially, inadequately or selectively."
*   **Yrastorza v. Latiza, 462 Phil. 145 (2003):** Court employees bear the burden of observing exacting standards of ethics and morality.
*   **Section 9, Rule XVII, CSC Resolution No. 91-1631:** Prohibits offsetting tardiness/absences by working beyond regular hours.
*   **Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Provides penalties for insubordination.
*   **Rule IV, Section 52(B)(5):** Defines penalties for insubordination.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The reliance on respondent's superior's alleged permission to "compensate" for absences is problematic, given Section 9, Rule XVII, CSC Resolution No. 91-1631.
*   The anonymous nature of the complaint and Respondent's allegations of harassment raise questions about potential bias, but this was not a bar to the investigation.

In conclusion, the Court found that Respondent was insubordinate and her actions were not excused by her personal circumstances, and her voluntary resignation allowed the Court to impose only a fine.
