Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document in markdown format:

**Case:** *Avelino and Asteria Daiz vs. Judge Protasio G. Asadon* (A.M. No. MTJ-98-1152, June 02, 1998)

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative Complaint against a Municipal Circuit Trial Court Judge.

**Complainants:** Avelino and Asteria Daiz (Spouses).

**Respondent:** Judge Protasio G. Asadon (deceased).

**Summary:**

The complainants filed an administrative complaint against Judge Asadon alleging evident bias and partiality, abuse of authority, and violation of Supreme Court circulars on punctuality and observance of office hours. The core of the complaint stemmed from a Slight Physical Injuries case filed against them.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Abuse of Authority:** The Supreme Court (SC) found Judge Asadon guilty of abuse of authority. The SC concurred with the Court Administrator that Judge Asadon prematurely issued a warrant of arrest against the complainants *before* requiring them to submit counter-affidavits and evidence, violating Sections 12(b) and 16 of the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure. This constituted a deprivation of liberty and disregard of due process.

    *   **Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, Sec. 12(b):** Mandates accused be given opportunity to submit counter-affidavits before further action.
    *   **Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, Sec. 16:** Restricts arrest to cases of failure to appear.

*   **Evident Bias and Partiality:** The SC dismissed this charge due to lack of substantial evidence. The complainants alleged a familial connection between the complainant in the criminal case and Judge Asadon's wife, but failed to prove it.
*   **Violation of Supreme Court Circulars (Punctuality):** This charge was also dismissed. Judge Asadon provided documentation (Resolutions, Affidavits, Memoranda, and Special Designations) showing he was performing judicial duties in other locations due to official assignments, thus explaining his absences.

**Penalty:**

*   A fine of P10,000.00 was imposed, to be deducted from the late Judge Asadon's retirement benefits.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Vito v. Buslon, Jr., 243 SCRA 519 (1995)* & *Wingarts v. Mejia, 242 SCRA 436 (1995)*: Cited to emphasize that judicial immunity is not a license for negligence, abuse, or arbitrary actions.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Standard of Proof:** The decision hinged on the *lack* of evidence presented by the complainants to substantiate their claims of bias and violation of office hours. This highlights the importance of robust evidence in administrative complaints against judges.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The fact that Judge Asadon was deceased at the time of the decision likely influenced the penalty.
*   **Due Process Violation:** The core issue is the violation of due process rights by premature issuance of a warrant. This remains a significant point of law, as it underlines the importance of adhering to procedural rules, even in summary proceedings.
*   **"Information" Regarding Escape:** The justification offered by the respondent judge that they were about to escape was not substantiated. This highlights the need for concrete, verifiable evidence to justify deviations from standard procedure.

**Legal Precision:**

The SC's decision rested on the clear violation of specific provisions of the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure. The findings were supported by the documentary evidence submitted by the respondent (pertaining to punctuality) and the lack of evidence from the complainants (regarding bias). The SC's application of the rule of law is evident, despite the respondent's death and the fact that his actions were related to slight physical injuries, due process needed to be observed.
