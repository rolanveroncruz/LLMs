**Case:** *Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals and Sabine Koschinger* G.R. No. 150592 (2009)

**Summary:**

This case involves a Petition for Certiorari filed by Philippine Airlines (PAL) challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) Resolution denying its motion to suspend proceedings in an appeal (CA-G.R. CV No. 65778) stemming from a design infringement and damages complaint filed by Sabine Koschinger against PAL. The RTC had ruled in favor of Koschinger. PAL then filed a motion for suspension of proceedings before the CA due to its SEC-approved corporate rehabilitation under P.D. 902-A. The Supreme Court (SC) ruled that the CA committed grave abuse of discretion by denying the motion, as the appeal involved a "claim" for damages subject to the SEC's stay order.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **SEC Stay Order:** All claims against PAL were suspended due to its SEC-approved corporate rehabilitation.
*   **Definition of "Claim":** The SC, referencing the Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation (A.M. No. 00-8-10-SC) and prior jurisprudence (e.g., *Spouses Sobrejuanite v. ASB Development Corporation* G.R. No. 165675, September 30, 2005, 471 SCRA 763, 772; *Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Zamora, G.R. No. 166996, February 6, 2007, 514 SCRA 584*), emphasized that the term "claim" encompasses all demands against a debtor, whether for money or otherwise, with no distinctions or exemptions, including unliquidated claims for damages.
*   **Scope of Suspension:** The suspension of claims extends to all phases of the suit, including appeals, and bars any action, including the rendition of judgment. The stay order is meant to prevent actions that would unduly hinder or prevent the "rescue" of the debtor company.
*   **Resumption of Proceedings:** Because PAL subsequently exited corporate rehabilitation, the SC ordered the CA to resolve the appeal with dispatch.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **PAL's Obligation:** To comply with the SEC's stay order during its rehabilitation, thereby suspending legal proceedings against it.
*   **Koschinger's Position:** Subject to the stay order, limiting her ability to pursue her claim against PAL during the rehabilitation period.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Duration of Stay Order:** The stay order was in effect only during the period of PAL's corporate rehabilitation. The order was lifted when PAL exited rehabilitation.
*   **Ambiguity (Resolved):** The CA incorrectly argued that the appeal was not a claim against PAL. The SC clarified that a prayer for damages makes the case a "claim."

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Finasia Investments and Finance Corporation v. Court of Appeals* G.R. No. 107002, October 7, 1994, 237 SCRA 446, 450
*   *Arranza v. B.F. Homes, Inc* 389 Phil. 318 (2000)
*   *Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Zamora, G.R. No. 166996, February 6, 2007, 514 SCRA 584*
*   *BF Homes, Incorporated v. Court of Appeals*, 190 SCRA 262, 269 (1990)

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 902-A (SEC jurisdiction over financially distressed companies)
*   Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation (A.M. No. 00-8-10-SC)

**Key Takeaway:**

This case reinforces the broad application of stay orders issued in corporate rehabilitation proceedings, encompassing all types of claims, including those pending on appeal. It underscores the SEC's power to protect distressed companies from legal actions that could impede their rehabilitation efforts.
