**Case Summary: Japzon v. COMELEC & Ty, G.R. No. 180088, January 19, 2009 (596 Phil. 354)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rules 64 and 65, assailing COMELEC resolutions which denied the disqualification of private respondent Jaime Ty as a candidate for Mayor.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Japzon sought to disqualify Respondent Ty from running for Mayor due to alleged material misrepresentation in his Certificate of Candidacy. Japzon argued Ty (a former natural-born Filipino who became a US citizen) did not meet the one-year residency requirement under Section 39 of RA 7160 (Local Government Code) and had not validly renounced his US citizenship.
*   Ty admitted being a former natural-born Filipino who became a naturalized US citizen. However, he claimed to have reacquired Philippine citizenship under RA 9225 (Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act) by taking an Oath of Allegiance. He presented evidence including a Philippine passport, Community Tax Certificates, and voter registration. He also executed a Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship.
*   COMELEC First Division and en banc ruled in favor of Ty, finding he met the requirements of RA 9225 and that he did not commit material misrepresentation regarding his residency.
*   Japzon argues that Ty lost his domicile of origin when he became a naturalized American citizen.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 7160, Section 39:** Defines the qualifications for local elective officials, including the one-year residency requirement.
*   **RA 9225, Section 5(2):** Specifies that those retaining or reacquiring Philippine citizenship under the Act must meet the qualifications for holding public office as required by the Constitution and existing laws, and must make a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship before any public officer authorized to administer an oath.
*   **COMELEC:** Authority to determine qualifications of candidates and rule on election disputes.
*   **Candidate (Ty):** Obligation to meet the residency requirements and other qualifications for holding office. Obligation to personally and swornly renounce foreign citizenship at the time of filing Certificate of Candidacy.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Disqualification:** A candidate found ineligible can be disqualified from holding office.
*   **Certificate of Candidacy Cancellation:** A materially false Certificate of Candidacy can be cancelled.
*   **Judicial Review:** COMELEC decisions are subject to judicial review under Rules 64 and 65, but the scope of review is limited to grave abuse of discretion.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **_Coquilla v. COMELEC_:** Defines "residence" for election law purposes as "domicile" or legal residence, requiring animus manendi (intent to remain).
*   **_Caasi v. Court of Appeals_:** Held that immigration to the United States by virtue of a 'green card,' which entitles one to reside permanently in that country, constitutes abandonment of domicile in the Philippines.
*   **_Papandayan, Jr. v. COMELEC_:** Summarizes various jurisprudence on residency qualifications for elective local officials, highlighting the principles of animus revertendi (intention to return) and animus non revertendi (intention to abandon the old domicile).
*   **_Aquino v. COMELEC_:** the Court did not find anything wrong in an individual changing residences so he could run for an elective post, for as long as he is able to prove with reasonable certainty that he has effected a change of residence for election law purposes for the period required by law

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Residency Requirement:** The central issue is whether Ty met the one-year residency requirement given his history as a US citizen and his travels. The court needed to determine if he was already a resident for more than one year before the election held on May 14, 2007.
*   **Abandonment of Domicile:** Whether Ty's naturalization as an American citizen and long-term residence in the US constituted an abandonment of his domicile of origin in the Philippines.
*   **COMELEC Findings:** The Supreme Court is bound by the COMELEC's factual findings unless there is grave abuse of discretion. The COMELEC's finding that Ty was a resident within the required time frame is a key hurdle for Japzon.

**Legal Analysis:**

*   The Court upheld the COMELEC's decision, finding no grave abuse of discretion. The Court agreed that Ty had reacquired his Philippine citizenship and had established domicile in General Macarthur.
*   Ty showed his intent to remain in the Philippines after reacquiring citizenship through acts like applying for a Philippine passport, securing Community Tax Certificates, and voter registration. His trips abroad did not negate his intention to reside in the Philippines permanently.
*   The Court emphasized the principle that election laws should be construed to give effect to the will of the voters, absent clear proof of disqualification.
