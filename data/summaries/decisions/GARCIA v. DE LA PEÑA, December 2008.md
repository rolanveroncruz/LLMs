Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court Resolution (A.M. No. MTJ-92-687), formatted in Markdown:

**Case Summary: *Engr. Edgardo C. Garcia vs. Judge Meljohn De la Pe単a***

**Nature of Document:** Resolution on a Plea for Judicial Clemency and Compassion.

**Background:**

*   Judge Meljohn de la Pe単a was previously dismissed from service in 1994 (Garcia v. De la Pe単a, 229 SCRA 778) for partiality, abuse of authority, and grave abuse of discretion related to Criminal Case No. 2577. The original penalty included dismissal with forfeiture of benefits and a perpetual ban on reemployment in government service.

**Key Provisions/Arguments in the Plea:**

*   Respondent seeks lifting of the ban on reemployment and payment of forfeited financial benefits.
*   He argues that he has reformed, served his church and the IBP (Integrated Bar of the Philippines), and regained the trust of his community, exemplified by being legal counsel for a rural bank.
*   Crucially, the original complainant, Engr. Edgardo Garcia, submitted an "Affidavit of No Objection," stating he has observed the respondent's reformation, has forgiven him, and does not oppose the lifting of the disqualification or the payment of benefits.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The Court *partially* grants the plea based on humanitarian considerations and precedents like *Cathay Pacific Airways, Ltd. v. Romillo, Jr.* and *Prudential Bank v. Castro.*
*   The Court amends its earlier resolution to allow Judge De la Pe単a to receive the cash equivalent of his accrued vacation and sick leave benefits earned during his government service.
*   **The ban on reemployment in government service remains in effect**, deemed practically moot given the respondent's age (over 73).

**Relevant Statutory and Case Law:**

*   **Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987):**  Governs penalties for dismissal, including forfeiture of benefits and disqualification from reemployment. The Court notes this was the basis for the original penalty.
*   **Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 41, Series of 1998, as amended by MC No. 14, Series of 1999:** States that an official penalized with dismissal is still entitled to terminal leave benefits.
*   **Section 11.A.1, Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC:** Dictates allowable sanctions. Provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits.
*   ***Cathay Pacific Airways, Ltd. v. Romillo, Jr.:*** (G.R. No. L-64276) and ***Prudential Bank v. Castro:*** (Adm. Case No. 2756) serve as precedents for granting limited financial benefits despite dismissal, based on humanitarian grounds.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Fiscal Management and Budget Office is now liable to compute and release the leave benefits.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The resolution could be seen as setting a precedent for partial clemency in administrative cases, though the specific facts (complainant's forgiveness, respondent's age) might limit its broader applicability.

**Key Takeaways:**

The Court balances the need for disciplinary action with humanitarian considerations. While upholding the seriousness of the original offense by maintaining the ban on reemployment, it grants limited financial relief based on the respondent's apparent rehabilitation and the complainant's explicit forgiveness.
