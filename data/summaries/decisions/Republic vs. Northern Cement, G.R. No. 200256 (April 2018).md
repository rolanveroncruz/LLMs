**Legal Document Summary: *Republic of the Philippines vs. Northern Cement Corporation***

**Case:** G.R. No. 200256, April 11, 2018 (829 Phil. 464)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmance of the RTC's decision granting Northern Cement Corporation's (NCC) application for land registration under PD 1529.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in affirming the RTC's decision granting land registration to NCC despite NCC's failure to comply with the requirements of PD 1529, particularly Section 14(2) (prescription).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversed the CA and RTC decisions, and *denied* NCC's application for land registration.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PD 1529, Section 14:** Outlines who may apply for land registration, specifically:
    *   **(1)** Open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain since June 12, 1945, or earlier. (Not applicable as NCC did not allege possession since this date).
    *   **(2)** Acquisition of ownership over private lands by prescription under existing laws. (Basis of NCC's application).
*   **Civil Code Articles 1137 & 1118:** Define prescriptive acquisition of ownership, requiring uninterrupted adverse possession for 30 years, without need of title or good faith, and possession must be in the concept of an owner, public, peaceful, and uninterrupted.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **NCC failed to prove acquisition by prescription:** The SC found NCC's evidence insufficient to establish the required character and duration of possession.
    *   Tax Declarations (1971-2003) were deemed intermittent and not conclusive evidence of ownership. *Republic v. Heirs of Montoya, 687 Phil. 542 (2012)*.
    *   Testimonies of adjoining landowners lacked specific details of NCC's acts of possession and were considered mere conclusions of law.
    *   Lack of proof of acts of occupation, development, cultivation or maintenance. The presence of "cogon" grass was viewed as indicative of idle land.
*   **Risk of further challenges:** Although the SC did not explicitly rule on the alienability of the land, the case opens the possibility of future challenges to any purported title stemming from that land based on the principles espoused in *Malabanan v. Republic, 605 Phil. 244 (2009)*, which deals with the requirement of an express government manifestation that land is no longer intended for public use.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Heirs of Crisologo v. Rañon, 559 Phil. 169, 181-182 (2007):*** Defined the requirements of acquisitive prescription (adverse, continuous, open, public, and in concept of owner).
*   ***Republic v. East Silverlane Realty Development Corporation, 682 Phil. 376, 394 (2012):*** Emphasized that "adverse, continuous, open, public, and in concept of owner" is a conclusion of law requiring clear proof.
*   ***Wee v. Republic, 622 Phil. 944, 956 (2009):***  Established that intermittent payments of real estate taxes are not sufficient to prove open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation.
*   ***Republic v. Heirs of Montoya, 687 Phil. 542 (2012):*** Tax declarations are not conclusive evidence of ownership but only a basis for inferring possession.
*   ***Malabanan v. Republic, 605 Phil. 244 (2009):*** Addressed the requirements for land to be considered alienable and disposable, and no longer intended for public use or service to be registrable.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The absence of an express declaration on the alienability of the land under the framework of *Malabanan* leaves potential ambiguity, although the SC sidestepped the issue in this case. The approved plan stated that the lot is “inside alienable and disposable area as per project No. 63, L.C. Map No. 698, certified on November 21, 1927." However, this is potentially insufficient under *Malabanan*.
*   The court emphasized that even if the land was alienable and disposable, NCC still failed to prove the required possession under PD 1529 and Civil Code Articles 1137 and 1118.

**Overall Risk Assessment:**

The decision significantly weakens NCC's claim to the land. While the SC avoided the issue of the alienability of the land, the lack of demonstrable possession and the cloud cast by the *Malabanan* case present substantial risks for NCC moving forward. Further challenges from the Republic or third parties are likely.
