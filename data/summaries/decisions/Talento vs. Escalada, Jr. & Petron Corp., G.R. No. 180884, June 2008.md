**Summary of _Talento v. Escalada, Jr._, G.R. No. 180884 (2008)**

**Case Summary:**

This case involves a petition for certiorari filed by the Provincial Treasurer of Bataan (Talento) assailing the RTC's grant of a preliminary injunction in favor of Petron Corporation, preventing the public auction of Petron's properties due to a disputed real property tax assessment. The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately dismissed Talento's petition.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Dispute:** Petron contested a revised real property tax assessment of P1,731,025,403.06, arguing: (1) assessment covered previously declared properties, (2) covered periods exceeding the 10-year limit under the Local Government Code (LGC), (3) incorrect fair market value calculations, (4) lack of prompt payment discounts, and (5) assessment should take effect in 2008.
*   **LGC Provisions:** The SC implicitly addresses Sections 231 and 252 of the LGC regarding tax collection pending appeal. Petron argued Section 222 regarding the 10-year limit on assessments.
*   **Preliminary Injunction:** The RTC granted a preliminary injunction contingent upon Petron posting an additional bond of P444,967,503.52, supplementing its existing surety bond of P1,286,057,899.54. The RTC found that proceeding with the sale despite the pending appeal and surety bond deprived Petron of its right to appeal.
*   **Petron's Surety Bond:** Petron posted a surety bond with the LBAA, attempting to suspend the tax collection.
*   **Procedural Issues:** Talento filed a petition for certiorari (Rule 65) instead of a petition for review on certiorari (Rule 45). The SC noted this error and the petition's late filing. The SC also found that Talento failed to file a motion for reconsideration before filing the petition for certiorari, and disregarded the rule on hierarchy of courts by going directly to the Supreme Court instead of the Court of Appeals.
*   **RA 9282:** The SC cited Section 11 of RA 9282, amending RA 1125 (Court of Tax Appeals Law), regarding suspension of tax collection by the CTA.
*   **Rules of Procedure of LBAA:** Addressed effect of appeal on collection of taxes and the provision of a surety bond.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petron:** Obligated to post the required surety bonds to maintain the preliminary injunction.
*   **Provincial Treasurer (Talento):** Obligated to follow the proper procedures for tax assessment and collection, and to respect a taxpayer's right to appeal.

**Liabilities:**

*   The primary liability is Petron's disputed real property tax of P1,731,025,403.06.  However, the validity of this liability is contingent upon the outcome of the appeal before the LBAA and Central Board of Assessment Appeals.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Assessment:** The validity of the revised assessment is the core issue. The arguments raised by Petron concerning the assessment period, valuation methods, and applicability of discounts create significant uncertainty. This presents a risk to the province if the assessment is ultimately overturned or significantly reduced.
*   **Impact on Petron's Operations:** The potential sale of Petron's properties (valued at P1.7 billion) posed a significant risk to its business operations. This justified the preliminary injunction.
*   **Surety Bond Adequacy:** The sufficiency of the surety bond to protect the province's interests in the event the assessment is upheld is a potential point of contention.
*   **LGC Interpretation:** Conflicting interpretations of LGC provisions regarding tax collection during appeal (Sections 231 and 252) versus the grounds for contesting the assessment.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules 41, 45, and 65 of the Rules of Court:** Addressed modes and timelines for appeal and the requisites for certiorari.

*   **Section 2(c) of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court**: Specifies that appeals raising questions of law should be filed with the Supreme Court by petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.
*   **Section 3, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court:** Provided grounds for issuance of preliminary injunction.

No. 132467,October 18, 2004, 440 SCRA 365, 374**: Jurisprudence that Rule 65 is an independent action that cannot be availed of as a substitute for the lost remedy of an ordinary appeal, including that under Rule 45, especially if such loss or lapse was occasioned by one's own neglect or error in the choice of remedies.
*   **Serra v. Heirs of Primitivo Hernaez, G.R. No. 142913, August 9, 2005, 466 SCRA 120, 127**: Jurisprudence that a motion for reconsideration is a sine qua non condition for the filing of a petition for certiorari.

Recourse should have been made first with the Court of Appeals and not directly to this Court.
*   **Mindanao Savings and Loan Association, Inc. v. Vda. De Flores, G.R. No. 142022, September 7, 2005, 469 SCRA 416, 423**: Jurisprudence that every case must be presented in accordance with the prescribed procedure to ensure an orderly and speedy administration of justice.

**Conclusion:**

The SC dismissed the petition due to procedural errors by the Provincial Treasurer and upheld the preliminary injunction in favor of Petron. The key legal issues revolve around the proper application of the LGC's provisions on real property tax assessment and collection during appeal, and the conditions under which a preliminary injunction may be granted. The validity of Petron's disputed tax assessment remains to be determined by the LBAA and Central Board of Assessment Appeals.
