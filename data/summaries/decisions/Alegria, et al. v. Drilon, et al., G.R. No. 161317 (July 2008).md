**Case Summary: *Cristita Alegria, et al. v. Eustaquia Drilon, et al.* G.R. No. 161317 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC's dismissal of an action for reconveyance and declaration of nullity of sale.

**Facts:** Petitioners, actual occupants of Lots 3658 & 3660, filed suit against respondents after Gabriel Drilon obtained free patents for the lots and subsequently sold them to Spouses Ybiosa. Petitioners alleged fraud in Drilon's free patent application and claimed the sale to Spouses Ybiosa was void because it occurred within the 5-year prohibitory period from patent issuance.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Free Patent Acquisition:** Gabriel Drilon obtained free patents (Patente Blg. 074620-92-985 and 074620-92-986). Issue: Whether the patents were fraudulently obtained, citing misrepresentation of occupancy and cultivation.
*   **Sale Within Prohibitory Period:** Spouses Drilon sold the land to Spouses Ybiosa within five years of patent issuance.
*   **Action for Reconveyance:** Petitioners, as occupants but not titleholders, sought reconveyance and annulment of sale. Issue: Whether petitioners have standing to bring such an action.
*   **Real Party-in-Interest:** Section 2, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court regarding the requirement for real party-in-interest in bringing a suit.

**Holding:** Petition dismissed; CA decision affirmed. Petitioners lack standing to sue for reconveyance.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Lack of Standing:** Reconveyance is a remedy only available to the owner of the property allegedly erroneously titled to another. ( *De la Peña v. Court of Appeals* G.R. No. 81827). Since petitioners are not titleholders or even applicants, they lack legal personality.
*   **State as Real Party-in-Interest:** Only the State, represented by the Solicitor General, can bring an action for reversion of public lands fraudulently awarded (Section 101, Commonwealth Act No. 141).
*   **Distinction from *Arsenal v. IAC*** Arsenal involved a double sale scenario, where a third person affected by a void sale within the prohibited period was allowed to invoke its nullity against a subsequent buyer with a title. In contrast, Petitioners in this case, are seeking to annul the title of Drilons due to obtaining patents through fraud.
*   **Void Sale Argument Fails:** While sale within the prohibited period can render a sale void, the ruling establishes that the petitioners do not have the standing to raise this.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Drilons (Potential):** Potential liability to the State if fraud in obtaining the free patent is proven in a separate action brought by the Solicitor General.
*   **Spouses Ybiosa:** Could potentially lose ownership if the State successfully pursues a reversion action.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **State Action for Reversion:** The decision does not preclude the State from initiating an action for reversion based on fraud in Drilon's free patent application.
*   **Ambiguous Occupancy Rights:** The decision does not address any possible occupancy rights the petitioners may have independently of the free patent.
*   **Good Faith of Spouses Ybiosa:** The court did not fully address if Spouses Ybiosa had the knowledge that the Petitioners were occupants of the land when they purchased the property. The trial court's decision did mention that the petitioners failed to establish a claim over the land.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   *De la Peña v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 81827 (1994): Defines reconveyance action and identifies the State as the proper party.
*   *Section 101, Commonwealth Act No. 141*: Mandates the Solicitor General to initiate reversion actions.
*   *Arsenal v. IAC*, 227 Phil. 36 (1986): While cited by petitioners, the court distinguishes it due to differing factual circumstances involving a double sale scenario.
*   *Caro v. Sucaldito*, G.R. No. 157536 (2005)
*   *Spouses Tankiko v. Cezar*, 362 Phil. 184 (1999)
*   *Garingan v. Garingan*, G.R. No. 144095 (2005)

**Conclusion:**

The petitioners' case was dismissed due to lack of standing to sue for reconveyance. The State retains the right to pursue a reversion action based on alleged fraud in the free patent application. The case highlights the importance of establishing property rights before challenging titles issued by the government.
