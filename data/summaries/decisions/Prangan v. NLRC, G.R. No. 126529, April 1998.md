**Case:** *Eduardo B. Prangan vs. National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), Masagana Security Services Corporation, And/Or Victor C. Padilla* G.R. No. 126529, April 15, 1998. (351 Phil. 1070)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the NLRC decision and ruled in favor of the petitioner, Eduardo B. Prangan, a security guard, regarding his claims for underpayment of wages and other benefits against his employer, Masagana Security Services Corporation. The central issue revolved around the actual hours of work rendered by Prangan. The Labor Arbiter initially awarded a reduced amount based on a four-hour workday, which the NLRC affirmed. The Supreme Court found grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in relying solely on allegedly falsified daily time records submitted by the employer, which the employee denied signing.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Employer's Obligation to Prove Reduced Work Hours:** When an employer alleges that an employee works less than the normal eight hours, the employer bears the burden of proving this with clear and satisfactory evidence.
*   **Employee's Right to Benefits:** Employee has a right to benefits based on a 12 hour work day.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Security Agency holds the burden of proof to show a deviation of the normal working hours of the employee.

**Liabilities:**

*   Masagana Security Services Corporation is liable for the underpayment of wages, overtime pay, premium pay for holiday, rest day, night shift differential, uniform allowance, service incentive leave pay and 13th month pay from the year 1990 to 1993.
*   Victor C. Padilla may be jointly or solidarily liable with the corporation, depending on the piercing the corporate veil doctrine.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Misrepresentation of Records:** Risk of employers falsifying or manipulating records to reduce labor costs and avoid legal obligations.
*   **Reliance on Insufficient Evidence:** Risk of labor tribunals relying on unsubstantiated or questionable evidence submitted by employers, potentially leading to unjust decisions.
*   **Estoppel:** The employer is estopped from assailing the contents of its own documents, such as personnel data sheets, that contradict its claims regarding work hours.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 83:** Defines the normal hours of work (8 hours per day).
*   **Burden of Proof (reduced working hours):** The employer has the burden to proof a reduction in working hours.
*   **Substantial Evidence:** Defined as such amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.
*   **Doubt in Labor Disputes:** *L.T. Datu and Co., Inc. v. NLRC, 253 SCRA 440 (1996); Soriano v. Offshore Shipping and Manning Corp., 177 SCRA 513 (1989).* Doubts reasonably arising from the evidence, or in the interpretation of agreements and writings should be resolved in the employee's favor.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The daily time records, which the employer claimed were proof of the four-hour workday, were the primary point of contention. The court deemed them unreliable due to their uniform entries and the employee's denial of their authenticity. The employer's failure to present other corroborating evidence was also a significant factor.

**Recommendations/Legal Strategy:**

*   This case highlights the importance of maintaining accurate and verifiable employment records.
*   In cases where employers attempt to reduce labor costs by claiming shorter work hours, robust evidence is required to support such claims.
*   The court will scrutinize discrepancies in the evidence and resolve doubts in favor of the employee, as per established labor law principles.
*   Evidence such as personal data sheet can be used to the benefit of the employee.
