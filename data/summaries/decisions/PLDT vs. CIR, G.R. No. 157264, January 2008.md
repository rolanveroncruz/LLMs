## Legal Document Summary: PLDT vs. CIR (G.R. No. 157264)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision that affirmed CTA denial of PLDT's claim for tax credit/refund of erroneously withheld taxes on separation pay.

**Key Provision:**  Section 28(b)(7)(B) of the 1977 NIRC (now Section 32(B)6(b) of the 1997 NIRC), excluding separation pay from gross income if due to death, sickness, disability, or causes beyond the employee's control.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **PLDT:**  Claiming refund as withholding agent, PLDT has the burden to prove (1) terminated employees *actually* received separation pay, (2) taxes were withheld *therefrom*, (3) the amounts withheld were *remitted* to the BIR, and (4) the employees declared the income payments as part of gross income (per Revenue Regulation 6-85).
*   **CIR:** Duty to refund erroneously or illegally collected taxes if the taxpayer meets the burden of proof.

**Potential Risks for PLDT:**

*   **Failure to prove payment of separation pay:** The CTA and CA found PLDT failed to sufficiently prove the employees *actually received* the separation pay, particularly for rank-and-file employees lacking signed acknowledgement receipts.  Cash vouchers alone deemed insufficient proof.
*   **Insufficient proof of remittance:** The CTA and CA found PLDT failed to properly verify the proof of income taxes withheld from redundant employees.  The amounts of total taxes withheld for each redundant employee, including the amounts of separation pay and other benefits cannot be properly identified and verified.
*   **Inadequate documentation:** Reliance on SGV audit report deemed insufficient, as the underlying documents used by SGV (the "documents from which SGV 'traced' the former to the latter have not been presented") to trace remittance could not be verified. This is especially problematic given the requirements outlined in CTA Circular 1-95 regarding submission of summaries and CPA certifications relating to voluminous documents.
*   **Rejection of "newly discovered evidence":** The CTA and CA rejected PLDT's motion for new trial to present receipts and quitclaims because they were unnotarized, lacking affidavits, and their late discovery was deemed implausible, suggesting potential antedating. The requirements for "newly discovered evidence" were not met under Rule 37 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Strict construction against taxpayer:**  The SC emphasizes that tax refunds are construed strictly against the taxpayer, increasing the burden of proof.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **NIRC Sections (1977 & 1997):**  Section 28(b)(7)(B) of the 1977 NIRC and Section 32(B)6(b) of the 1997 NIRC (exclusion from gross income).
*   **Revenue Regulation 6-85:** Requires proof that employees declared separation pay as part of gross income and presentation of BIR Form No. 1743.1 (statement of amount paid and tax withheld).
*   **CTA Circular 1-95 (as amended by 10-97):**  Procedure for presenting voluminous documents (summary and CPA certification).
*   **Rule 37, Rules of Court:** requirements for new trial.
*   **Far East Bank and Trust Company v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 129130):**  Strict construction against taxpayer for tax refunds; CTA's factual findings are generally binding.
*   **Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (G.R. No. 145526):**  Purpose and effect of CTA Circular 1-95.
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. A. Soriano Corporation (G.R. No. 113703):** Caveat against liberal application of rules of procedure to excuse negligence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** None explicitly identified. The main point of contention is the *sufficiency* of PLDT's evidence to prove its claim.
