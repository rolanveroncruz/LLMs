Okay, here's a summary of the legal document, formatted for a lawyer's review:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Cezar Cortez and Froilan Bagayawa* (G.R. No. 239137, December 05, 2018)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Cezar Cortez for two counts of Homicide and three counts of Murder.

**Facts:**

*   **Incident:** On May 19, 1988, in Angeles City, multiple victims (Mario Punzalan, Minda Duarte Punzalan, Josielin Mesina, Baby Mesina, and Efren Villanueva) were killed in "Minda's Bakery."  Accused, Cezar Cortez and Froilan Bagayawa, were implicated. Froilan died during apprehension.
*   **Initial Charge:** Robbery with Multiple Homicide (Art. 294(1), Revised Penal Code [RPC]).
*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** Janet Quiambao, a relative, witnessed the killings. Richard Punzalan also hid during the events.
*   **Evidence:** Recovery of Mario Punzalan's missing watch from Froilan's body.
*   **Accused's Defense:** Denial and alibi.  Cortez claimed to be a "tinapa maker" in Tarlac at the time and denied knowing the victims or Bagayawa.

**RTC Ruling:**

*   Convicted Cortez of two counts of Homicide (Mario and Efren) and three counts of Murder (Minda, Baby, and Jocelyn) (Articles 249 and 248, RPC, respectively).
*   Found the prosecution failed to prove robbery.
*   Held that the killings of Minda, Baby, and Jocelyn were attended by abuse of superior strength.
*   Sentenced accordingly: Homicide - *prision mayor* (8 years) to *reclusion temporal* (17 years), with civil indemnity (P50,000) and temperate damages (P25,000) for each count; Murder - *reclusion perpetua*, with civil indemnity (P50,000) and temperate damages (P25,000) for each count.

**CA Ruling:**

*   Affirmed the RTC conviction with modifications to the penalties, increasing the amount of damages for each crime.
* Increased temperate damages and added moral damages.
*   Added interest of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of the judgment.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Denied the appeal but modified the conviction:** One (1) count of Homicide (Efren) and four (4) counts of Murder (Mario, Minda, Baby, and Jocelyn).
*   **Rationale for Modification:**
    *   **Treachery:**  Found that the killings of Mario, Minda, Baby, and Jocelyn were attended by treachery, not abuse of superior strength. Mario was attacked while sleeping; the other three were also attacked while sleeping, unarmed, and defenseless.
    *   **Abuse of Superior Strength:**  The Court clarified that *People v. Villanueva, 807 Phil. 245, 253 (2017)* requires that the assailants "purposely sought the advantage, or that they had the deliberate intent to use this advantage." The evidence did not establish that the assailants *specifically* sought deadly weapons for the *purpose* of exploiting superior strength against the female victims; their actions were indiscriminate.
    *   **Homicide:** The killing of Efren was properly classified as Homicide due to lack of evidence of treachery or abuse of superior strength.
*   **Penalties Imposed:**
    *   Homicide (Efren): *prision mayor* (8 years and 1 day) to *reclusion temporal* (14 years, 8 months, and 1 day). Civil indemnity, moral damages, and temperate damages of P50,000 each, with 6% interest from finality.
    *   Murder (Mario, Minda, Baby, and Jocelyn): *reclusion perpetua* for each count. Civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages of P75,000 each, and temperate damages of P50,000 each, for each count, all with 6% interest from finality. (Citing *People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806, 848 and 846-847 (2016)* for the amount of damages).

**Key Provisions, Obligations, Liabilities:**

*   **Liability:** Cezar Cortez is criminally liable for one count of Homicide and four counts of Murder.
*   **Obligation:** Cortez is obligated to serve the sentences imposed and to pay the specified damages to the heirs of the victims.
*   **Statutory References:** Articles 248 (Murder) and 249 (Homicide) of the Revised Penal Code, Indeterminate Sentence Law.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** Reliance on eyewitness testimony from Janet Quiambao, taken 20+ years later.  Credibility could be challenged based on the delay and potential for memory distortion.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The document does not include details of how the victim's watch was handled by police, which may bring the potential for chain of custody issues to the forefront.
*   **Abuse of Superior Strength vs. Treachery:** The Court's distinction between the two qualifying circumstances is crucial.  The line between indiscriminate violence and specifically seeking advantage is a gray area.
*   **Application of *Jugueta*:** The court cites *People v. Jugueta* for damages. Verify the applicability of *Jugueta* given the facts of the case, in line with current jurisprudence.
