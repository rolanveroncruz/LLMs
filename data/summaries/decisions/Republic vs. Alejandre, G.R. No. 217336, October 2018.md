**Legal Document Summary: Republic vs. Spouses Alejandre (G.R. No. 217336)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA Decision that affirmed the RTC's grant of land registration.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   Respondents (Spouses Alejandre) filed an application for registration of Lot No. 6487 under PD 1529, claiming ownership via a Deed of Absolute Sale from Angustia Lizardo Taleon, who inherited it.
*   LRA initially noted discrepancies in the submitted plan, leading to reverifications.
*   The Republic opposed, arguing the applicants failed to prove open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession since June 12, 1945, that the land is alienable and disposable public land, and that no muniment of title was submitted.
*   The RTC initially granted the application, later amended to reflect an increased area. CA sustained the amended decision.

**Legal Basis Claimed by Respondents:**

*   Section 14(4) of PD 1529: Acquisition of ownership in any manner provided by law (specifically, through purchase).

**Government's Argument:**

*   Applicants failed to prove the land is alienable and disposable.
*   Applicants failed to prove open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession since June 12, 1945, or earlier.
*   Applicants failed to overcome the presumption that the land is public domain.
*   The Republic argues for the application of Section 48(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended by PD 1073, requiring proof of possession since June 12, 1945, or earlier.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court GRANTED the Petition, reversing the CA and RTC decisions and dismissing the application for registration.
*   The Court held that the Respondents, while claiming ownership through derivative means (sale and inheritance), failed to prove the land's nature or classification as alienable and disposable.
*   The Court reaffirmed the Regalian Doctrine: All lands not clearly of private ownership presumptively belong to the State. The onus to prove alienability rests on the applicant, which respondents failed to do.
*   The Court noted that mere tax declarations, the Deed of Absolute Sale, and technical descriptions are insufficient to overcome the presumption that the land is inalienable public domain.
*   The land covered by (4) cannot be other than alienable and disposable land of public domain, i.e., public agricultural lands and private lands or lands of private ownership in the context of Article 435.
*   The court references Article 419, 420, 421, 422, 424, 425 of the Civil Code classifying property of public dominion and private ownership.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The decision reinforces the high burden of proof required to overcome the Regalian Doctrine.
*   Ambiguity lies in the interpretation of Section 14(4) of PD 1529 and its relation to the requirement of alienability and disposability.  The Court clarifies that even under 14(4), the land must be proven to be alienable and disposable (public agricultural lands and private lands or lands of private ownership in the context of Article 435.)
*   The ruling clarifies the definition of Patrimonial property "By nature or use" or those covered by Article 421, which are not property of public dominion or imbued with public purpose based on the State's current or intended use; and (2) "By conversion" or those covered by Article 422, which previously assumed the nature of property of public dominion by virtue of the State's use, but which are no longer being used or intended for said purpose.

**Conclusion:**

This case serves as a reminder of the strict requirements for land registration and the importance of establishing the alienable and disposable nature of the land sought to be registered.  Applicants relying on derivative titles (sale, inheritance) must demonstrate the land's classification, and mere possession or tax declarations are insufficient.  The Court's reliance on the Regalian Doctrine creates a significant hurdle for private individuals seeking to register land.
