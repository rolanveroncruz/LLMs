**Case Summary: *Hernandez v. San Juan-Santos* (G.R. Nos. 166470 & 169217)**

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) decisions affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) ruling: (1) declaring Maria Lourdes San Juan Hernandez ("Lulu") an incompetent and appointing Jovita San Juan-Santos (respondent) as her legal guardian; and (2) granting a writ of habeas corpus to the respondent for custody of Lulu.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Incompetency Finding:** The RTC, affirmed by the CA, declared Lulu incompetent under Rule 92, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, due to a "weak mind, disease," and other similar causes, finding her incapable of caring for herself and managing her property without outside aid. This was based on medical reports, testimony from attending physicians, and the trial judge's own observations. The decision specifically highlighted Lulu's medical conditions (tuberculosis, rheumatism, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), low educational attainment, and below-average intelligence level.
*   **Guardianship Appointment:** Jovita San Juan-Santos, Lulu's maternal cousin, was appointed legal guardian. The CA upheld this, noting Lulu's distrust of the petitioners (her half-siblings and stepmother) and the importance of trust in a guardianship relationship.
*   **Habeas Corpus:** The CA granted a writ of habeas corpus to Jovita, securing her custody of Lulu, after the petitioners allegedly abducted Lulu from her apartment.
*   **Property Administration Issues:** The petitioners (Cecilio, Ma. Victoria, Teresa Hernandez) and their deceased father, Felix Hernandez, allegedly mismanaged and dissipated Lulu's substantial estate (valued at approximately P50 million in 1997), including the sale and lease of her properties under questionable circumstances (e.g., special power of attorney obtained for the sale of the Montalban property to Meralco and the lease of the Montalban property to Oxford Concrete Aggregates). Notably, the court alleges the purchase of one of Lulu's properties in 1974, used to develop the Marilou Subdivision.
* **Accounting of Property:** The court ordered the Petitioners to render an accurate and faithful accounting of all of Lulu's properties they unlawfully appropriated.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners' Obligation:** Render a full accounting of Lulu's properties and funds appropriated from her estate within 30 days. Potential criminal liability for dissipation of the estate and unlawful abduction.
*   **Respondent's Obligation:** As legal guardian, Jovita is responsible for the care, custody, and management of Lulu's person and estate (Rule 96, Section 1, Rules of Court).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Estate Value Dispute:** The actual value of Lulu's estate may be contested during the accounting process.
*   **Statute of Limitations Defense:** Petitioners argued that any challenge to the 1974 "sale" of property to Felix Hernandez is barred by the statute of limitations, which could affect the estate's composition.
*   **Informal Property Administration Period:** From 1968 to 1993, Felix Hernandez administered the property, and from 1993 to 1998, petitioners took over. The lack of formal legal oversight of the property during that time could lead to difficulty in tracing transactions and valuing the estate.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 92, Section 2, Rules of Court:** Definition of "incompetent" as applied to persons of weak mind, age, disease, or similar causes that render them unable to care for themselves and their property.
*   **Rule 96, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Scope of guardianship, outlining the guardian's responsibilities for the ward's person and estate.
*   **Rule 130, Section 50, Rules of Court:** Admissibility of lay opinion on the mental sanity of a person sufficiently known to the witness.
*   **Articles 194-196, Family Code:** Provisions regarding mutual support obligations among siblings, invoked by petitioners to argue for their right to care for Lulu.
*   ***Ilusorio v. Bildner, 387 Phil. 915 (2000)*:** The scope of a writ of habeas corpus extends to unlawful detention.

**Potential Issues for Further Investigation:**

*   The validity of the 1974 transfer of property from Lulu to Felix Hernandez in light of possible undue influence and her competency at that time.
*   Detailed accounting of all transactions involving Lulu's properties during the period of informal administration by Felix and the petitioners.
*   Determination of any breaches of fiduciary duty by Felix and the petitioners regarding the management and sale of Lulu's assets.
