## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Bangalan* (G.R. No. 232249)

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).

**Ruling:** Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and acquitted the accused-appellant Bangalan.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Corpus Delicti:** The case hinges on the integrity of the corpus delicti (the seized marijuana). The court reiterates that the identity of the dangerous drug must be established with moral certainty.
*   **Chain of Custody (Section 21, RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640):** The prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody, specifically in relation to the required witnesses during inventory and photography.
*   **Required Witnesses:** Critical lapse was the absence of representatives from the DOJ and the media (required under the pre-RA 10640 version of Section 21) during the inventory of the seized drugs. The prosecution failed to provide a justifiable reason for their absence or demonstrate genuine efforts to secure their presence.
*   **Photography:** Lack of any evidence regarding photographs of the confiscated items, an unexplained and unjustified deviation from procedure.
*   **Saving Clause (Section 21(a), IRR of RA 9165):** The prosecution failed to invoke the "saving clause" effectively. The Court found the excuse provided (PO2's inability to remember) inadequate to justify the non-compliance with the witness requirements. The Court emphasizes the prosecution's burden to prove justifiable grounds for non-compliance, and the courts cannot presume its existence.
*   **Procedural Lapse:** A significant procedural lapse in compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended, regarding the mandatory presence of certain witnesses during inventory.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   The conviction was overturned due to the prosecution's failure to adhere to the strict requirements of Section 21, RA 9165 and establish a clear chain of custody. This failure led to a compromised evidentiary value of the seized drugs.
*   The case serves as a reminder to law enforcement to meticulously follow the chain of custody procedures in drug cases, including the proper documentation and justifiable explanation for any deviations.
*   The case highlights the importance of securing the presence of required witnesses and ensuring proper documentation throughout the process to safeguard the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence, which goes into the core of proving the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5, Article II:** Defines the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs.
*   **RA 10640:** Amended Section 21 of RA 9165, concerning chain of custody procedures.
*   **People v. Miranda (G.R. No. 229671, January 31, 2018):** Re-emphasized the State's duty to account for lapses in chain of custody, regardless of whether the defense raises it.
*   **People v. Umipang (686 Phil. 1024):** Discusses the importance of strict compliance and the application of the saving clause.
*   **Section 21 (a), Article II of the IRR of RA 9165:** Contains the "saving clause" allowing for non-compliance under justifiable grounds.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "justifiable grounds" for non-compliance with Section 21 are subject to interpretation. The Court emphasizes that mere statements of unavailability are insufficient. Actual, serious attempts to secure the presence of required witnesses must be demonstrated. The burden of proof for justifying non-compliance lies with the prosecution.

**Conclusion:**

This case underscores the criticality of strict adherence to the chain of custody rule in drug cases. The prosecution's failure to adequately justify the absence of required witnesses and the lack of photography resulted in the reversal of the conviction, highlighting the importance of meticulous compliance with procedural safeguards to ensure the integrity of evidence and due process.
