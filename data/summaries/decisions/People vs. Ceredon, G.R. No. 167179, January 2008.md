Okay, here's a legal summary of *People v. Ceredon* (G.R. No. 167179, January 28, 2008) formatted in Markdown:

**Case Summary: *People v. Ceredon* (G.R. No. 167179)**

**Nature of the Case:** Automatic appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of the accused-appellant, Elmer Ceredon y Pagaran, for ten (10) counts of rape.

**Facts:**

*   Accused-Appellant was charged with ten counts of rape under Article 266(A) and (B) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by RA 8353 and RA 7659 (prior to RA 9346's abolishment of the death penalty).
*   The victim (AAA) was the Accused-Appellant's younger sister. The incidents occurred between 1995 and 2000, when the victim was between 10 and 15 years old.
*   The Accused initially pleaded "not guilty" but later changed his plea to "guilty" on all counts during re-arraignment, with assistance of counsel.
*   The RTC convicted the Accused based on the evidence presented by the prosecution, including the victim's testimony and his admission of the acts.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether the RTC erred in convicting the Accused based on an *improvident plea of guilty.*
2.  Whether the Informations were insufficient due to the lack of precise dates of the commission of the offenses.
3.  Whether the RTC erred in imposing the death penalty.
4.  Whether the Informations were defective for not specifically alleging the relationship (brother-sister) as being "within the second degree of consanguinity."

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction with modification.

1.  ***Plea of Guilt:** The Court found that the plea was not improvident because (a) the accused was assisted by counsel; (b) the charges were read in Ilocano (his native tongue); and (c) the conviction was based on the prosecution's evidence, not solely on the plea.* The Court held that the strict requirements of a "searching inquiry" regarding the voluntariness of the plea were less critical after RA 9346 abolished the death penalty.
2.  ***Sufficiency of the Information:** The Court ruled that the absence of precise dates was not fatal to the Informations. The exact date is not an essential element of the offense, as long as the offense is stated to have been committed at a time "as near as possible" to the actual date. The occurrence of rape is the material act. Victim was also young during the abuse and not expected to remember dates.
3. ***Qualifying Circumstance** Court held it wasn't necessary in this case that the Information should specifically state that the appellant is a relative by consanguinity within the third civil degree of the victim because a sister-brother relationship is obviously in the second civil degree and no other sister-brother relationship exists in civil law that falls beyond the third civil degree.
4.  ***Penalty:** In light of RA 9346, the death penalty was *reduced to *reclusion perpetua* for each count.* The Court stated that the accused is *not eligible for parole* under the Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4103).
5.  ***Damages:** The Court affirmed civil indemnity (P75,000 per count) and exemplary damages (P25,000 per count) awarded by the CA. *Moral damages were increased* from P50,000 to P75,000 per count, without requiring pleading or proof.

**Key Provisions and Legal References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 266(A) and (B):** Definition and penalties for rape.
*   **Republic Act (RA) 8353 & RA 7659:** Amendments to the RPC regarding rape penalties, *prior* to the abolition of the death penalty.
*   **Republic Act (RA) 9346:** Abolished the death penalty.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 116, Section 3:** Procedure for accepting a plea of guilty to a capital offense.
*   **Act No. 4103 (Indeterminate Sentence Law):** Determines parole eligibility.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Improvident Plea Argument:** While rejected by the Court, the argument regarding the adequacy of the "searching inquiry" into the voluntariness of the plea could be resurrected in similar cases.
*   **Discretion on Specific Facts:** The extent of the *Lakindanum* exception (sustaining conviction despite a flawed inquiry) depends heavily on the specific facts of each case. The absence of precise dates could be a continuing point of contention in the legal interpretation.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant:** Obligated to serve the imposed sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for each count of rape and is liable for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.
*   **State:** Obligated to ensure the accused-appellant is not eligible for parole.
*   **Victim (AAA):** Entitled to receive the awarded damages as compensation for the harm suffered.
