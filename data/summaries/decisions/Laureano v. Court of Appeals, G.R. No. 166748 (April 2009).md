**Case:** *Laureano V. Hermoso, as represented by his Attorney-in-Fact Florida L. Umandap, Petitioner, vs. Court of Appeals and Heirs of Antonio Francia and Petra Francia, namely: Benjamin P. Francia, Cecilia Francia, Amos P. Francia, Jr., Francisco F. Villarica, Danilo F. Villarica, Rodrigo F. Villarica, Melchor F. Villarica, Jesus F. Villarica, Benilda F. Villarica and Ernesto F. Villarica, Respondents.* G.R. No. 166748, April 24, 2009.

**Summary:**

This case involves a petition for review regarding the coverage of two land parcels under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 27 (Emancipation of Tenants). The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the Office of the President's decision, denying the petition for coverage under P.D. No. 27 filed by Laureano Hermoso. The Supreme Court (SC) denied Hermoso's petition, affirming the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Land Parcels:** Lot Nos. 3257 (Petra Francia) and 3415 (Antonio Francia) in Malhacan, Meycauayan, Bulacan.
*   **Tenancy:** Hermoso and Banag had been occupying and cultivating the land since 1978.
*   **DAR Order:** Initially, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) granted the petition for coverage of the land under P.D. No. 27 (Operation Land Transfer), directing the issuance of emancipation patents (EP).
*   **DARAB Cases (424-BUL-92 & 425-BUL-92):** DARAB upheld the tenancy relationship, affirmed by the Supreme Court (G.R. No. 127668). The Court denied the petition for lack of verification.
*   **Conversion Order:** The core issue is the DAR Secretary's Order dated June 5, 1973, declaring the lands as suited for residential, commercial, industrial, or other urban purposes, predating the petition for EP.
*   **RA 6389 Amendment:**  Amended RA 3844, removes the requirement to actually implement the conversion of land from agricultural to non-agricultural.
*   **Disturbance Compensation:** The SC ordered the case remanded to the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator for the proper computation of the disturbance compensation of the petitioner.

**Obligations:**

*   **Landowner:** Obligated to pay disturbance compensation to the tenant (Hermoso).
*   **Petitioner:** Entitled to disturbance compensation but not an EP.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Hermoso):** Could be liable for any overpayment of disturbance compensation if it is already granted.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Valuation Disputes:** The determination of disturbance compensation could be contentious and lead to further litigation, particularly regarding the "average of the gross harvests."

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Natalia Realty, Inc. v. Department of Agrarian Reform*, G.R. No. 103302, August 12, 1993, 225 SCRA 278: Emphasized that lands not devoted to agricultural activity are outside the coverage of CARL.
*   *De Guzman v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 156965, October 12, 2006, 504 SCRA 238: Reiterated the removal of the implementation timeline for land conversion.

**Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 27:** Decreeing the Emancipation of Tenants from the Bondage of the Soil.
*   **R.A. No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code):** Section 36 concerning possession of landholding.
*   **R.A. No. 6389:** Amendment to R.A. No. 3844, removing the timeline for land conversion.
*   **R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988):** Section 65 regarding conversion of lands.
*   **R.A. No. 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991):** Section 20 regarding reclassification of lands.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Average of the gross harvests":** The method and basis for calculating this figure for disturbance compensation purposes can be disputed, especially given the lapse of time.
*   **Disturbance Compensation:** Although the DAR Secretary's order declared the land was suited for urban purposes, the fact that actual conversion was delayed could be used to argue for an increased amount of disturbance compensation based on lost opportunity costs.

**Legal Strategy:**

The SC found that the land had already been declared for residential purposes, making it not covered by P.D. 27. Also, the SC affirmed the fact that under R.A. No. 6389, the condition imposed on the landowner to implement the conversion of the agricultural land to non-agricultural purposes within a certain period was deleted. Therefore, Hermoso is only entitled to a disturbance compensation based on the order.
