**Legal Document Summary: *Cariño v. Maine Marine Phils., Inc.* (G.R. No. 231111, October 17, 2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision denying permanent and total disability benefits, sickness allowance, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees to a seafarer, Cariño.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Central Issue:** Whether Cariño is entitled to permanent and total disability benefits despite allegedly abandoning medical treatment with the company-designated physician.
*   **POEA-SEC Section 20(A):**  This case revolves around the interpretation and application of Section 20(A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC regarding employer's obligations for work-related injury or illness of seafarers. Focuses on the provision of medical treatment, payment of sickness allowance until declared fit to work or disability assessed, and mandatory reporting requirements.
*   **Abandonment of Treatment:** The CA and NLRC found that Cariño abandoned medical treatment by failing to attend a scheduled appointment. The Supreme Court reversed, finding that Cariño's failure to attend was due to the employer's (Maine Marine) failure to approve medical treatment and pay sickness allowance, essential for his travel.
*   **Employer's Obligations:** The SC emphasized the employer's *concurrent* duty to provide medical treatment and sickness allowance, citing *The Late Alberto B. Javier v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc.* (738 Phil. 374 (2014)). Failure to fulfill these obligations cannot be used as a basis to deny disability benefits.
*   **120-Day Rule & Disability Assessment:** The company-designated physician failed to issue a final disability assessment within 120 days, which the court said rendered the seafarer's disability total and permanent, citing *Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. v. Quiogue, Jr.* (765 Phil. 341 (2015)). The employer cannot use the employee's non-attendance as a result of the employer's own actions to avoid assessment.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Maine Marine Phils., Inc. and Corazon Guese-Songcuya (Respondents):**  Jointly and severally liable for:
    *   Permanent and Total Disability Benefit: US$93,154.00 (based on the applicable CBA)
    *   Sickness Allowance: US$939.60 (for 120 days)
    *   Moral Damages: P100,000.00
    *   Exemplary Damages: P100,000.00
    *   Attorney's Fees: 10% of the total monetary award
    *   Legal Interest: 6% per annum from finality of the decision until full satisfaction.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **CBA Applicability:** The CA initially questioned the applicability of the AMOSUP CBA, requiring that a copy be present on the first filing, not presented initially. This created conflict regarding the amount of disability benefits due. The Supreme Court corrected this, citing *Andaya v. National Labor Relations Commission* (502 Phil. 151 (2005)), and holding that technical rules of evidence are relaxed in labor cases.
*   **Moral and Exemplary Damages:**  The increase in moral and exemplary damages reflects the Court's finding of bad faith on the employer's part. The Court emphasized employers are not to take advantage of a seafarer's condition.
*   **Joint and Several Liability:**  Under Section 10 of the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995 (RA 8042, as amended by RA 10022), the agency and employer are jointly and severally liable. This provision is important for enforcement.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **2010 POEA-SEC, Section 20(A):**  The core provision governing seafarer disability claims.
*   **Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995 (RA 8042, as amended by RA 10022), Section 10:**  Establishes joint and several liability of the employer and agency.
*   **Civil Code Article 2208:** Basis for awarding attorney's fees.
*   ***The Late Alberto B. Javier v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc.*** (738 Phil. 374 (2014)): Clarifies the three-fold liability of the employer regarding medical repatriation, treatment, and allowances.
*   ***Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. v. Quiogue, Jr.*** (765 Phil. 341 (2015)):  Highlights the company-designated physician's obligation to issue a final assessment within 120 days.
*   ***Andaya v. National Labor Relations Commission*** (502 Phil. 151 (2005)): Documents submitted before the NLRC can still be admitted as evidence.
*   ***Orient Hope Agencies, Inc. v. Jara (G.R. No. 204307, June 6, 2018).*** The ruling on the damages awarded for the blithe manner which the petitioner dealt with the respondent's condition.
**Conclusion:**

This case clarifies the employer's obligations under the POEA-SEC and emphasizes that employers cannot exploit a seafarer's situation to avoid liability. The ruling reinforces the principle of construing the POEA-SEC liberally in favor of seafarers and highlights the importance of timely payment of sickness allowance and provision of medical treatment.
