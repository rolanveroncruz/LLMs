## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Lazaro*, G.R. No. 186379

**Case Summary:** This case is an appeal by Bienvenido Lazaro ("Bienvenido") from a Court of Appeals decision affirming his conviction for statutory rape by the Regional Trial Court (RTC). The RTC originally found Bienvenido guilty of rape, not the complex crime of forcible abduction with rape initially charged. The CA affirmed, with a modification to increase moral damages. The Supreme Court (SC) denied the appeal and affirmed the CA's decision, except that the amount of moral damages was reduced.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Statutory Rape (carnal knowledge of a woman under 12 years of age).
*   **Victim:** AAA, 11 years old at the time of the offense.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Damages:** P50,000 civil indemnity and P50,000 moral damages.

**Obligations:**

*   Bienvenido is obligated to serve his sentence of Reclusion Perpetua.
*   Bienvenido is obligated to pay the victim P50,000 as civil indemnity and P50,000 as moral damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Bienvenido is criminally liable for statutory rape.
*   Bienvenido is civilly liable for damages resulting from the rape.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Appeal Failure:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.
*   **Alibi Weakness:** The defense of alibi was unsuccessful due to proximity and inconsistency.
*   **Inconsistency in Testimony of the accused:** The accused's testimony lacked clarity, as he gave two different reasons for being near the victim.
*   **Delayed Reporting:** The victim's delayed reporting was noted, but explained due to fear of threats made by the defendant, so not seen as a weakness in the case.
*   **Alleged Defective Complaint:** Bienvenido claimed the uncle (BBB) initiated the complaint, violating Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code and Section 5, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court. However, the court refuted this claim, noting the victim (AAA) signed the complaint and affidavit.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 344** (prior to amendment by R.A. 8353):  Governs the prosecution of offenses like rape, requiring initiation by the victim or close relatives. The appellant tried to invoke this as he claimed it was initiated by the victim's uncle and the court determined he failed to prove this claim.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 110, Section 5**:  Similar to Article 344, specifies who can initiate rape prosecutions.
*   **People v. Orquina:** Principles guiding rape cases (accusation easy to make, difficult to prove; complainant's testimony scrutinized; prosecution's evidence must stand alone).
*   **People v. Somodio:** Absence of consent is presumed when the woman is below 12 years old. Statutory Rape elements.
*   **People v. Sambrano:** Moral damages award criteria based on aggravating circumstances.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Date of Commission:** There was a minor inconsistency in the victim's testimony regarding the exact date of the offense (August 12 vs. August 31), which the SC dismissed as immaterial, and considered an inadvertence by the Prosecutor. The exact time of commission of rape is not a material ingredient of the offense.
*   **Initiation of Complaint:** As mentioned above, Bienvenido unsuccessfully tried to argue the uncle initiated the complaint. This was a contentious point.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court upheld the conviction and ordered the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua, civil indemnity of P50,000, and moral damages of P50,000. The court found the victim credible and her testimony consistent with the medical findings. The defenses of alibi and denial were deemed weak and unconvincing. The prior ruling was thus upheld.
