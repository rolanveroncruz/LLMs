**Case:** *Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Amer Bara-acal*, A.M. No. SCC-95-2, March 31, 1998 (351 Phil. 604)

**Summary:**

This is an administrative case against Judge Amer Bara-acal of the Shari'a Circuit Court, Bongao, Tawi-Tawi, for *absenteeism* and *falsification of official documents* (Certificates of Service).

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Complaint:** Based on an anonymous letter and subsequent investigation, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) charged Judge Bara-acal with failing to regularly report to his official station.
*   **Investigation:** Initial investigation and later, a more thorough investigation by Judge Memoracion, revealed conflicting testimonies. Initially, employees stated the Judge was never at the courthouse, they later recanted. Ultimately, the court deemed testimonies of disinterested witnesses (MCTC employees) more credible.
*   **Absenteeism:** The Court found substantial evidence demonstrating Judge Bara-acal's consistent absence from his post, effectively constituting abandonment of his duties. This violated the Interim Rules and Guidelines implementing Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 regarding required court session hours.
*   **Falsification:** The Court found that Judge Bara-acal submitted falsified Certificates of Service, falsely attesting to his regular attendance, further aggravating the misconduct.
*   **Lack of Credible Defense:** Judge Bara-acal's denial and self-serving affidavits from some employees were deemed insufficient to overcome the evidence of his absence.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   Judge Bara-acal violated his obligation to maintain regular office hours as mandated by the Interim Rules and Guidelines implementing Batas Pambansa Blg. 129.
*   He breached his duty to uphold the highest standards of honesty and integrity in public service.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Judge Bara-acal was found guilty of serious misconduct (falsification) and absenteeism.

**Sanctions:**

*   **Dismissal:** The Supreme Court dismissed Judge Bara-acal from service.
*   **Preclusion from Reinstatement:** He is barred from reinstatement in any government position.
*   **Forfeiture of Benefits:** He forfeited all earned or accrued retirement and other benefits.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Interim Rules and Guidelines implementing Batas Pambansa Blg. 129:** Cited for the requirement of daily court sessions and its purpose of ensuring efficiency and speedy justice.
*   **Memorandum Circular No. 30 of the Civil Service Commission (July 20, 1989):** Used to determine that falsification of official documents is a grave offense warranting dismissal.
*   **Rule 140, Sections 3, 4, 5, and 10 of the Rules of Court:** Cited for the penalty for absenteeism or "frequent unjustified absences without leave" and the amendment by Supreme Court resolution dated November 22, 1990.
*   *Mejia v. Panaan, 160 SCRA 457 (1988)*: reinforces that those involved in the administration of justice must live up to the strictest standards of honesty and integrity in the public service.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Testimony:** The initial conflicting testimony from the Shari'a Court employees could have posed a challenge to the investigation. The court adequately addressed this by assessing credibility based on prior statements and potential influence.
*   **Reliance on Anonymous Complaint:** While the case originated from an anonymous complaint, the OCA's independent investigation and corroborating evidence validated the allegations.
*   **Subjectivity in "Regularly":** The interpretation of "regularly reporting" could potentially be a point of contention; however, the consistent and prolonged absences, coupled with the falsified certificates, negated any ambiguity.

**Legal Precision:**

The decision clearly states that the judge's actions constituted gross misconduct and that the penalties imposed align with existing jurisprudence and administrative guidelines. The decision relies on a careful review of the factual record and credibility assessments, supporting its determination that the judge violated his duties.
