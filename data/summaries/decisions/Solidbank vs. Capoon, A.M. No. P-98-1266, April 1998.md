## Legal Document Summary: Solidbank Corporation vs. Capoon, Jr. and Tabirao (A.M. No. P-98-1266)

**Nature:** Administrative case against court personnel for gross negligence, grave misconduct, and bias.

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Solidbank Corporation
*   **Respondents:** Roberto B. Capoon, Jr. (Branch Clerk of Court) and Virginia Tabirao (Clerk for Civil Cases), RTC Branch 62, Makati City.

**Key Issue:** Failure of the respondents to furnish Solidbank's counsel with a copy of the court Order dated August 6, 1993, dismissing Civil Case No. 92-021 ("Solidbank vs. Ballistics Armoring Corporation, et al.") for failure to prosecute.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Duty of Court Personnel:** The Court reiterates the critical importance of court personnel in the administration of justice and their obligation to act with honesty, integrity, and propriety. They have a duty to ensure court orders are served to litigants with dispatch.
*   **Service of Court Orders (Rule 13, Sec. 4, Rules of Civil Procedure):** Every judgment, resolution, order, pleading subsequent to the complaint shall be filed with the court, and served upon the parties affected.
*   **Clerk of Court's Administrative Functions (Sec. 5, Rule 136, Rules of Court):** Highlights the Clerk's responsibility for prompt and sound administration of justice, especially concerning notifications of orders.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Virginia Tabirao:** Found guilty of neglect of duty for failing to properly supervise a casual employee tasked with mailing notices, including the dismissal order.
*   **Roberto B. Capoon, Jr.:** Found liable for failing to ensure orders were promptly served despite claiming heavy caseload. Excuses related to workload are deemed insufficient justification for dereliction of duty.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense of "Following Past Practice":** Tabirao's argument that she was merely following the practice of a previous employee is rejected, indicating a lack of independent diligence and an assumption of risk.
*   **Dismissal Justification Irrelevant:** The Court explicitly states that whether the dismissal for failure to prosecute was warranted is *not* the issue. The core inquiry is whether the respondents performed their duty to provide notice. This approach eliminates potential arguments about the merits of the underlying case impacting the administrative penalty.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Mejia vs. Pamaran, 160 SCRA 457*
*   *Llanes vs. Borja, 192 SCRA 288*
*   *Tan vs. Herras, 195 SCRA 1*
*   *Juntenilla vs. Branch COC Teresita J. Calleja, et al., P-96-1225 (OCA IPI No. 95-96 P), September 23, 1996*

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 13, Section 4, Rules of Civil Procedure
*   Rule 136, Section 5, Rules of Court

**Ambiguities & Contentious Issues:**

*   There does not appear to be any ambiguious clauses.

**Outcome:**

*   Virginia Tabirao: Fined P500 for neglect of duty and conduct prejudicial to the service.
*   Both Tabirao and Capoon, Jr.: Reprimanded with a warning that future similar acts will be dealt with more severely.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court emphasizes the fundamental duty of court personnel to ensure proper notification of orders, regardless of caseload or reliance on subordinates. The rejection of the "following past practice" defense highlights the importance of independent diligence. The case demonstrates a zero-tolerance approach to negligence in administrative duties, even when the underlying merits of the dismissed case are not directly at issue. The potential risk for other court personnel is clear: failure to ensure proper service of orders can lead to administrative sanctions.
