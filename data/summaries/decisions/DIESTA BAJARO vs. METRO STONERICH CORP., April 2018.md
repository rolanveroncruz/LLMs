Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Mario Diesta Bajaro v. Metro Stonerich Corp., and/or Ibrahim M. Nu√±o* (G.R. No. 227982, April 23, 2018)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Issue:** Whether the petitioner, Mario Diesta Bajaro, was a regular employee of Metro Stonerich Corp. and whether he was illegally dismissed.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, finding that Bajaro was a project employee and not illegally dismissed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Project Employee Status:** Bajaro was hired for specific construction projects with defined start and end dates. Metro Stonerich submitted Establishment Employment Reports to DOLE, indicating project-based employment. This is crucial under Department Order No. 19, Series of 1993. *Dacles v. Millenium Erectors Corp.* lays out requirements to prove project-based employment.
*   **Obligation to Inform:** Metro Stonerich fulfilled its obligation to inform Bajaro of his project-based employment status and the duration of each project through "Kasunduan Para Sa Katungkulang Serbisyo (Pamproyekto)" contracts.
*   **Termination:**  Termination upon project completion was deemed valid. *Malicdem, et al. v. Marulas Industrial Corporation, et al.*, notes project employee tenure is coterminous with the work to which he is assigned.
*   **Wage and Benefits:** The Court affirmed the Labor Arbiter's award of overtime pay differentials (based on Article 87 of the Labor Code), proportionate 13th-month pay, and service incentive leave (SIL) pay (based on Article 95 of the Labor Code), plus attorney's fees (10% of the total monetary award, citing Article 111 of the Labor Code). Employer bears the burden to prove payment of wage and benefits per *Loon, et al. v. Power Master, Inc., et al.*
*   **Interest:** All monetary awards will earn legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until the full satisfaction of the obligation.

**Liabilities:**

*   Metro Stonerich is liable for underpaid overtime pay, unpaid proportionate 13th-month pay, unpaid SIL pay, and attorney's fees, plus interest.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Project" Misclassification:**  The case underscores the need for employers to rigorously document project-based employment to avoid misclassification claims. Ambiguity in project definition or lack of clear communication to employees can lead to regularization claims.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Employer's failure to maintain proper records of wage and benefit payments can result in liability, as the burden of proof rests on the employer.
*   **Impact of Repeated Rehiring:**  While repeated rehiring *does not automatically* confer regular status in the construction industry (*William Uy Construction Corp. v. Trinidad*), excessive or continuous re-hiring *could potentially* be construed as evidence of regularization if not properly documented and managed as distinct projects with defined scopes and durations.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Dacles v. Millenium Erectors Corp.:** Outlines the elements necessary to establish project-based employment.
*   **William Uy Construction Corp. v. Trinidad:** Addresses the unique nature of the construction industry and the limitations of applying length of service as a determinant of regular employment.
*   **Malicdem, et al. v. Marulas Industrial Corporation, et al.:**  Notes project employee tenure is coterminous with the work to which he is assigned in the construction industry.
*   **Gadia, et al. v. Sykes Asia, Inc., et al.:** Explains the "projects" wherein the project employee is hired.
*   **Loon, et al. v. Power Master, Inc., et al.:**  Employer bears the burden to prove payment of wage and benefits.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 294 (formerly Article 280):**  Distinguishes between regular and project employment.
*   **Labor Code, Article 87:** Establishes overtime pay requirements.
*   **Labor Code, Article 95:** Establishes Service Incentive Leave (SIL) entitlement.
*   **Labor Code, Article 111:**  Authorizes attorney's fees in cases of unlawfully withheld wages.
*   **Department Order No. 19, Series of 1993:**  Guidelines Governing the Employment of Workers in the Construction Industry.
