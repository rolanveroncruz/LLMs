## Summary of *Mary Ann Estoque vs. Reynaldo O. Girado*, A.M. No. P-06-2250

**Nature:** Administrative case against Sheriff Reynaldo O. Girado for dereliction of duty.

**Complainant:** Mary Ann Estoque, plaintiff in Civil Case No. 23-242-94 ("Marcela A. Estoque et al. v. Apo View Hotel, et al.").

**Respondent:** Reynaldo O. Girado, Sheriff IV, Regional Trial Court, Branch 33, Davao City.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Alias Writ of Execution:**  Issued July 7, 2000, ordering enforcement of a prior amicable settlement in Civil Case No. 23-242-94.
*   **Sheriff's Duty:** Girado failed to implement the alias writ, submit a return of execution, or provide monthly progress reports as required under Section 14, Rule 39 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.
*   **Court Orders:** Girado repeatedly disregarded court orders directing him to submit returns and explain his inaction (orders dated February 1, 2001; April 27, 2001; October 26, 2001; January 14, 2002; and June 15, 2004).  This failure to comply with judicial orders constitutes a serious breach of duty.

**Liabilities & Findings:**

*   **Guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty:** The Supreme Court found Girado guilty of simple neglect of duty under the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. This is defined as failure of an employee to give attention to a task expected of him and signifies a disregard of a duty resulting from carelessness or indifference.
*   **Penalty:** Fined an amount equivalent to one month's salary. A stern warning was issued that repetition of similar acts will result in more severe penalties (potentially dismissal for a second offense per CSC rules).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Respondent's Defense:** Girado argued that implementation was impossible due to the defendant E.B. Villarosa & Partner Co. Ltd.'s closure and the unknown whereabouts of its officers. The Court rejected this defense, emphasizing the sheriff's ministerial duty to execute the writ and make returns, regardless of perceived futility.
*   **No Prior Administrative Record:** The relatively light penalty suggests the absence of prior disciplinary actions against Girado, which mitigated the sanction. Future similar complaints will likely lead to harsher penalties.
*   **Enforcement of Original Judgment:**  The decision focuses on the administrative liability of the sheriff. The underlying issue of enforcing the original judgment in Civil Case No. 23-242-94 remains unaddressed and requires separate action (potentially assignment of a new sheriff).
*   **Case Law:** The decision cites *Vargas v. Primo, A.M. No. P-07-2336, January 24, 2008* and other cases to underscore the ministerial duty of sheriffs and the importance of timely returns on writs of execution.

**Relevant Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 14, Revised Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Governs the return of writs of execution and the reporting obligations of sheriffs.
*   **Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (Resolution No. 99-1936):**  Defines simple neglect of duty and prescribes penalties.

**Contentious Clauses/Areas:**

*   The "humble understanding" argument presented by the respondent regarding the impossibility of implementing the writ. While understandable on a practical level, it directly contradicts the established ministerial duty of a sheriff and was rightfully rejected by the Court.
