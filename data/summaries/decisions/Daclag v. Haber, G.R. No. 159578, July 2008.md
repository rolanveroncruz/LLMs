## Legal Document Summary: *Daclag v. Haber*, G.R. No. 159578 (2008)

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari where the Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) ruling in favor of respondents Haber and Del Rosario (Heirs of Eusebio Macahilig) regarding a dispute over a parcel of land. The RTC declared a Deed of Sale between Maxima Divison (sister of Eusebio Macahilig) and petitioners Daclag null and void and ordered the Daclag spouses to reconvey a portion of the land to the Heirs of Eusebio Macahilig and to pay damages, specifically ten (10) cavans of palay per annum, and attorney's fees.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Extra-judicial Partition (March 18, 1982):** Divides seven parcels of land among heirs of Candido and Gregoria Macahilig, including one parcel ("Parcel One") allocated to heirs of Mario and Eusebio Macahilig. This deed forms the basis for respondents' claim.  Critically, not all heirs participated in the partition.
*   **Statement of Conformity (March 19, 1982):** Maxima Divison acknowledges and conforms to the Extra-judicial Partition, waiving rights to land adjudicated to co-heirs. This undermines her later claim of ownership.
*   **Deed of Sale (May 23, 1984):** Maxima Divison sells "Parcel One" to spouses Daclag. This deed is the central point of contention, as the courts found Maxima did not have the right to sell.
*   **Free Patent & OCT No. P-13873 (July 17, 1984):** Rogelia Daclag obtains a certificate of title based on a free patent application. The court found that the Torrens title does not vest better rights than what she actually had.
*   **Reconveyance:** The RTC and CA ordered petitioners Daclag to execute a Deed of Reconveyance of the northern portion of the land back to the respondents Haber and del Rosario.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Spouses Daclag:** Ordered to vacate and deliver possession of the northern half of "Parcel One" to respondents, execute a deed of reconveyance, pay ten (10) cavans of palay annually from the second cropping of 1984 until possession is restored, and pay attorney's fees.
*   **Maxima Divison (deceased):** Originally a co-defendant, she defaulted. However, the RTC ruled that any claims against her expired with her death in 1993.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Claims by Other Heirs:** The court explicitly states that its decision only addresses the issues between the current parties and does not affect the rights of other heirs of Candido and Gregoria Macahilig who did not participate in the original Deed of Extra-judicial Partition. These heirs could potentially bring future claims. The SC specifically noted that not all of the heirs were involved in the Extra-judicial Partition, leaving open potential future claims by those not participating.

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Basis for the Petition for Review on Certiorari.
*   **Rule 74, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Governs extrajudicial settlement of estates. Specifically, the court noted that that no extrajudicial settlement shall be binding upon any person who has not participated therein or had no notice thereof.
*   **Articles 1458 & 1459, Civil Code:** Seller's obligation to transfer ownership and requirement of ownership for a valid sale.
*   ***Nemo dat quod non habet*:** Legal principle that one cannot give what one does not have.
*   ***Naval v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 167412, February 22, 2006:** Emphasizes that registration under the Torrens system does not create title, but merely evidences ownership.
*   ***Ong v. Olasiman*, G.R. No. 162045, March 28, 2006:** Good faith defense is irrelevant for unregistered land.
*   ***Heirs of Dicman v. Carino*, G.R. No. 146459, June 8, 2006:** Findings of the Court of Appeals are conclusive and binding.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Good Faith Purchase:** Petitioners argued they were purchasers in good faith. The court rejected this argument, emphasizing that the good faith defense applies primarily to registered land, and the property in question was unregistered at the time of the sale.
*   **Ownership vs. Possession:** Petitioners argued Maxima's possession and tax declarations established ownership. The court held that possession was permissive and the tax declarations were not conclusive evidence of ownership.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   **Reconsideration is unlikely to be successful given the SC affirmation of the CA and RTC decisions.** Focus on compliance with the reconveyance order and mitigating damages.
*   **Identify other potential heirs who were not parties to the original partition.** Determine if their claims are time-barred or otherwise extinguished.
*   **Investigate the possibility of a claim against Maxima's estate for breach of warranty against eviction (although RTC already dismissed this and the claim may be time-barred).**
