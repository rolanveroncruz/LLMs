**Legal Document Summary: *Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. v. Nikko Sources International Corp., and Supermax Philippines, Inc.*, G.R. No. 178479, October 23, 2009**

**Subject Matter:** Extrajudicial Foreclosure; Validity of Notice of Sale; Preliminary Injunction.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. (MBTC) - Lender, Creditor
*   **Respondents:** Nikko Sources International Corp. (Mortgagor), and Supermax Philippines, Inc. (Debtor) - Borrowers

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan and Mortgage:** Supermax obtained loans from MBTC secured by a mortgage on property owned by Nikko.
*   **Default and Foreclosure:** Supermax defaulted on the loans, leading MBTC to initiate extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings.
*   **Notice of Sale:** Initial notice of sale scheduled for August 4, 2000, rescheduled multiple times (Nov 7, Nov 14).
*   **RTC Action:** Respondents filed a complaint (Civil Case No. BCV 2000-146) seeking to nullify the notice of sale and challenge interest rates, obtaining a TRO and preliminary injunction.
*   **Grounds for Injunction:** Respondents alleged exorbitant interest rates and failure to comply with posting and publication requirements.

**Obligations:**

*   **MBTC:** Obligation to comply with all statutory requirements for extrajudicial foreclosure, including proper notice and publication as per Act No. 3135 and Circular No. 7-2002.
*   **Supermax:** Original obligation to repay the loans according to the loan agreements.

**Liabilities:**

*   **MBTC:** Potential liability for damages if the foreclosure sale is deemed invalid due to non-compliance with legal requirements.
*   **Supermax/Nikko:** Liability for the outstanding loan amount, subject to any defenses regarding interest rates or other contractual issues.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Invalid Foreclosure Sale:** Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Act No. 3135 (specifically Section 3 regarding publication and posting of notice) could render the sale voidable.
*   **Damages:** Potential for MBTC to be held liable for damages if the foreclosure is found to be wrongful due to improper notice or other procedural defects.
*   **Pending Appeal:** While the original case (Civil Case No. BCV-2000-146) was dismissed for failure to prosecute, the respondents' appeal remains pending, meaning the underlying issues of interest rates and validity of the foreclosure could be re-litigated if appeal is successful.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135, Section 3:** An Act to Regulate the Sale of Property Under Special Powers Inserted In or Annexed to Real Estate Mortgages. Requires specific posting and publication of notices of sale. Critical for compliance.
*   **Circular No. 7-2002:** Guidelines for Extra-Judicial Foreclosure of Mortgage. While the specific requirement for republication addressed by the circular was not yet in effect at the time of the original sale date, the court relies on the principle behind ensuring adequate public notice.
*   ***Philippine National Bank v. Nepomuceno Productions, Inc.*, 394 SCRA 405 (2002):**  Cited for the principle that republication is required if the foreclosure does not proceed on the originally intended date, even prior to Circular 7-2002.
*   ***Development Bank of the Philippines v. Aguirre*, 417 Phil. 235 (2001):**  Reinforces the principle that the foreclosure sale held more than two months after the published date of sale was considered void for lack of republication.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interest Rate:** The unilateral imposition of an exorbitant interest rate is a contentious point that was never adjudicated as original case was dismissed for failure to prosecute.
*   **Republication Requirement:** The petitioner argued that republication was not required due to respondents' request for postponement and because Circular No. 7-2002 was not yet in effect. The court rejects this argument, citing principles derived from Act 3135 and relevant case law.

**Legal Precision:**

The Supreme Court *affirms* the Court of Appeal's decision. The critical holding is that *republication of the notice of sale is required when the foreclosure sale is postponed to a later date,* regardless of whether Circular 7-2002 was in effect at the time, to provide sufficient notice to potential bidders. The failure to republish renders the petition to overturn the injunction moot.
