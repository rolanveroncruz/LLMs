**Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 150536 (Bienvenido Gomba v. People of the Philippines)**

**Case Overview:**

Bienvenido Gomba (Petitioner), common area administrator of MRB-NGCP Phase 1 homeowners association, was convicted of Estafa under Art. 315(1)(b) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) for misappropriating collected association dues and water bill payments. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision. This petition to the Supreme Court (SC) contests that conviction.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). This involves misappropriation or conversion of money, goods, or other personal property received in trust, on commission, for administration, or under any obligation involving a duty to deliver or return the same, to the prejudice of another.
*   **Elements of Estafa (Art. 315(1)(b), RPC):**
    1.  Receipt of money/property in trust, commission, administration, or similar obligation.  *Found to be satisfied as Gomba received collections as administrator.*
    2.  Misappropriation or conversion. *Court found this satisfied due to failure to remit collections despite demand.*
    3.  Prejudice to another. *Association was prejudiced by the unremitted funds.*
    4.  Demand for return. *Association demanded remittance, which Gomba failed to do.*
*   **Misappropriation Defined:** Using another's property as one's own, devoting it to a different purpose, or disposing of it without right. *The Court cited **Lee v. People of the Philippines, G.R. No. 157781, 11 April 2005, 455 SCRA 256, 267**.*
*   **Evidence:** Unremitted collections (P237,996.44), memoranda demanding remittance, failure to provide a detailed accounting, and Gomba's offer to settle (Kasunduang Tagapamayapa) which he reneged on. Reports submitted were not with their corresponding remittances
*   **Defense:** Gomba denied misappropriation, claiming faithful performance and incurring expenses. *Court deemed this insufficient due to lack of substantiation and considered it a weak denial (cited **People v. Magbanua, G.R. No. 133004, 20 May 2004, 428 SCRA 617, 630**).*

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Gomba was obligated to remit collections to the association daily.
*   Gomba is liable for the unremitted amount of P237,996.44 plus legal interest from June 16, 1999 until fully paid.
*   Gomba is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment: six years, eight months, and 21 days of *prision mayor* to 20 years of *reclusion temporal*.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Circumstantial Evidence:** The conviction heavily relies on circumstantial evidence of misappropriation (demand and failure to account). A stronger defense could have challenged the evidence establishing these elements.
*   **Lack of Specific Accounting:**  Gomba's failure to provide detailed expense accounting severely weakened his defense.  Substantiating these expenses would have been crucial.
*   **Evidentiary Issues:** Gomba raised issues regarding the admissibility of the audit report and authentication of handwriting, but the Court found these arguments unpersuasive and deferred to the trial court's assessment. *This is a potential point of contention depending on the circumstances surrounding the audit report's creation and introduction.*
*   **Affirmance of Lower Courts:** The SC affirmed the factual findings of the RTC and CA, which are generally given great weight. *Successfully challenging these findings requires demonstrating clear and convincing evidence of reversible error, per **Perez v. People of the Philippines, G.R. No. 150443, 20 January 2006, 479 SCRA 209, 219-220** and **Pascual v. People of the Philippines, G.R. No. 160540, 22 March 2007***.

**Conclusion:**

The SC denied Gomba's petition, upholding the conviction for Estafa. The case highlights the importance of meticulously accounting for funds held in trust and the weakness of a bare denial as a defense against misappropriation charges.
