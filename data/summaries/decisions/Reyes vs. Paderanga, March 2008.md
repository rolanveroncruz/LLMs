## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-06-1973 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 05-2329-RTJ)

**Case:** Asuncion Reyes v. Judge Rustico D. Paderanga, Regional Trial Court, Branch 28, Mambajao, Camiguin.

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint against a Judge.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charges:** Bias, ignorance of the law and procedure, antedating orders, failure to resolve cases within the reglementary period, and refusal to inhibit. (related to 5 civil cases)
*   **Bias & Refusal to Inhibit:** Charges dismissed. Complainant failed to present substantial evidence of intentional bias or prejudice stemming from extrajudicial sources (Español v. Mupas).  The judge's relationship to counsel in Civil Case No. 517 was beyond the degree that mandates disqualification under Rule 137, Section 1 of the Rules of Court. Discretionary inhibition is primarily a matter of conscience (Santos v. Lacurom).
*   **Antedating Orders:** Charge dismissed due to weak evidence. Explanation regarding undermanned court deemed plausible.
*   **Gross Ignorance of Law:**  Judge found guilty regarding the December 9, 2004 Resolution in Civil Case No. 517 (Partition Case).
    *   **Rationale:** The judge dismissed the case based on prematurity despite the defendant's active participation (pre-trial, partial settlement, benefiting from a partial judgment rendered by the court, constitution of a commission). Defendant was deemed to have waived the defense of prematurity by actively participating in the proceedings. Dismissal also potentially undermines a previous partial judgment and mooted a pending SC petition.
    *   **Statutory Reference:** Rule 90 of the Rules of Court (regarding determination of estate debts before partition).
*   **Undue Delay:** Judge found guilty in resolving the motion to withdraw deposits in Civil Case No. 676 and in deciding an appeal in Civil Case No. 676.
    *   **Rationale:** Motion to withdraw was non-litigable and should have been resolved promptly. Judge took 97 days. Unreasonable given the non-litigable nature of the motion (Bagano v. Hontanosas).
    *   **Statutory Reference:** Sec. 5 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary.
    *   **Constitutional Reference:** Constitution provides lower courts must resolve matters within 3 months from submission.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Judges have a constitutional and professional obligation (Canon 6, Sec. 5 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct) to decide cases promptly (within 90 days). Failure to request an extension when unable to comply constitutes a breach.
*   Judges must possess basic knowledge of legal principles and procedure. Gross errors can lead to administrative liability (Enriquez v. Caminade).

**Penalties:**

*   Gross Ignorance of Law: Fine of P20,000.00 (taking into account this is the respondent's first administrative infraction) (Balayon, Jr. v. Dinopol). Section 8, Rule 140
*   Undue Delay: Fine of P15,000.00 (Balsamo v. Suan). (less serious charge under Section 8, Rule 140, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC)
*   Stern warning issued against future similar offenses.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The ruling hinges on the interpretation of "active participation" in Civil Case No. 517. The extent and significance of the defendant's actions are key to upholding the finding of gross ignorance.
*   The lack of specific criteria for "non-litigable motions" creates potential for subjective judgment on whether a delay is justifiable.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   Español v. Mupas (Bias)
*   Santos v. Lacurom (Inhibition)
*   Bagano v. Hontanosas (Non-litigable motions)
*   Enriquez v. Caminade (Gross ignorance of the law)
*   Balayon, Jr. v. Dinopol (Gross ignorance of the law)
*   Balsamo v. Suan (Undue Delay)

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 137, Section 1, Rules of Court (Disqualification of Judges)
*   Rule 90, Rules of Court (Partition of Estate)
*   Canon 6, Sec. 5 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary (Promptness)
*   Section 8, Rule 140, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC (Sanctions)
