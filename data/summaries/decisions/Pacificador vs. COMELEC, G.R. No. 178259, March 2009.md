Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided *Pacificador v. COMELEC* case:

**Case:** *Arturo F. Pacificador and Jovito C. Plameras, Jr. v. COMELEC, et al.* G.R. No. 178259, March 13, 2009.

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Injunction, challenging a COMELEC resolution forming a new Provincial Board of Canvassers (PBOC).

**Facts:**

*   Petitioners (Pacificador and Plameras) ran for Governor of Antique in the May 14, 2007 elections against private respondent (Perez).
*   Prior to the election, petitioners filed a disqualification case against Perez alleging violations of Section 261(o)(v)(w) of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC) based on the use of public funds and resources for campaign activities.
*   After the elections but before proclamation, petitioners sought suspension of canvassing due to alleged fraud. This was denied by the COMELEC Second Division.
*   The COMELEC First Division dismissed petitioners' appeal regarding the initial PBOC's (Barcenal PBOC) ruling against them due to a failure to file a timely appeal under Sec. 20(f) of RA 7166 and Sec. 9 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure. It then created a new PBOC (Mabutay PBOC).
*   COMELEC First Division subsequently relieved the Mabutay PBOC and created another PBOC (Majarucon PBOC) ordering them to proclaim the winning candidates.
*   Petitioners filed the present petition arguing the illegality of the Majarucon PBOC formation, alleging violations of Sec. 2 of COMELEC Resolution No. 7859 (requires cause for relief of BOC) and Sec. 21 of RA 6646 (specifies order of substitute officials). They argued the resolution was issued solely to proclaim the winning candidates before pending actions were resolved and without the proper record.
*   Petitioners also contended the COMELEC First Division lacked authority to issue the June 22, 2007 resolution, citing Secs. 5 and 6, Rule 19 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, which require COMELEC *en banc* consideration of motions for reconsideration.

**Key Provisions at Issue:**

*   **Section 261(o)(v)(w) of the Omnibus Election Code:** Prohibits use of public funds, facilities, and resources for election campaigns, release/disbursement of public funds during certain periods, and construction of public works during specific pre-election timeframes.
*   **Sec. 20(f) RA 7166 & Sec. 9 COMELEC Rules:** Timelines for appeals regarding contested election returns.
*   **Sec. 2 of COMELEC Resolution No. 7859:** Requires "cause" for relief of the Board of Canvassers.
*   **Sec. 21 of RA 6646:** Specifies order of priority for substitute PBOC members.
*   **Secs. 5 and 6, Rule 19 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure:** Motion for Reconsideration filed before the COMELEC pertaining to any resolution, order or ruling of a Division shall be heard by the COMELEC en banc.
*   **Section 277 of the Omnibus Election Code:** COMELEC's power of direct control and supervision over BOCs and authority to relieve and substitute members *motu proprio*.
*   **Sec. 3, Art. IX-C of the Constitution & Sec. 13, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure:** Finality of COMELEC decisions/resolutions.

**COMELEC Arguments:**

*   Petition failed to attach a certified copy of the assailed resolution, violating procedural rules (Sec. 5, Rule 64 of the Rules of Civil Procedure).
*   Petition for prohibition is improper because the resolution was final and executory (no motion for reconsideration filed).
*   The issue is moot because the private respondent was already proclaimed. Proper remedy is an electoral protest.
*   COMELEC has the power to supervise and control BOCs, and the replacement was valid.

**Court's Holding:**

The Court denied the petition.

*   The petitioners failure to attach a copy of the assailed COMELEC resolution was a fatal procedural defect.
*   Even if the Court relaxed the rules, the petition lacked merit because there was no grave abuse of discretion by COMELEC.
*   The COMELEC First Division was exercising its power under Sec. 277 of the OEC.
*   The enumeration of substitute officials in Sec. 21 of RA 6646 is *not* exclusive. COMELEC can appoint officials outside that list if necessary. Citing *Aquino v. COMELEC*, 22 SCRA 388.
*   The assailed resolution became final and executory because no timely motion for reconsideration was filed with the COMELEC *en banc*. Citing Rule 18 of the Omnibus Election Code.
*   Since the Private Respondent had already been proclaimed Governor, discussion of the issues raised in the disqualification case was rendered unnecessary.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Non-Exclusive List of Substitute Officials:** The interpretation of Sec. 21 of RA 6646 as *non-exclusive* grants broad discretion to COMELEC.
*   **Finality of COMELEC Decisions:** The strict application of the finality rules in the COMELEC Rules of Procedure highlights the need for immediate action and procedural compliance.
*   **Mootness Doctrine:** The case underscores the potential for issues to become moot due to proclamation, emphasizing the need for expeditious resolution of pre-proclamation disputes.
*   **Disqualification vs. Protest:** The decision doesn't directly address the merits of the disqualification case, potentially allowing unresolved allegations of election violations to persist, which could raise issues in future elections.
*   **Interpretation of "Cause":** The decision lacks specific discussion of what constitutes "cause" for removing a member of the board of canvassers under OEC 277.
