## Legal Document Summary: *Eduardo Colmenares and Epifania Colmenares vs. Heirs of Rosario Vda. de Gonzales, et al.* (G.R. No. 155454, December 10, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA Resolutions denying due course to a petition for certiorari.

**Facts:**

*   **Underlying Action:** Ejectment case filed by respondents (landowners) against petitioners (lessees) stemming from an oral lease agreement initiated in 1946 between Rosario Vda. de Gonzales and Arturo Colmenares. The lease involved Lots 209-A, 210, and 10186-B in Talisay, Cebu.
*   **Lease Terms:** Oral agreement, indefinite period, with escalating rent initially at P150.00, eventually reaching P1,000.00.
*   **Prior Litigation:** Previous ejectment action (Civil Case No. 140) due to non-payment of rent was settled after back rentals were paid.
*   **Present Dispute:** Respondents claimed the lease terminated upon Arturo's death and demanded petitioners vacate. Petitioners refused, leading to the current ejectment case.
*   **MTC Decision:** Ruled there was a valid oral lease for an indefinite period, conditioned on continuous rental payments. Fixed the lease period at 20 years from the 1981 decision, with rent at P1,500.00/month, with a possible 10% increase. The petitioners were considered not builders in good faith and must shoulder the expenses in removing the improvements.
*   **RTC Decision:** Affirmed the existence of the lease but reduced the lease period to 10 years and increased rent to P5,000.00/month.
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   Respondent-heirs of Rosario Vda. de Gonzales filed a petition for review with the CA, which was denied and attained finality.
    *   RTC suspended its resolution on the petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration of the RTC decision pending the CA Decision.
    *   RTC ordered the MTC to execute its judgment.
    *   Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari directly with the CA, alleging grave abuse of discretion by the MTC.
    *   The CA denied due course to the petition.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Validity & Duration of Oral Lease:** The core dispute revolves around the nature and enforceability of the oral lease agreement. The MTC and RTC differed on its duration and rent amount, indicating ambiguity.
*   **Petitioners as Builders in Good Faith:** Determination of whether petitioners are builders in good faith and their right to reimbursement for improvements is an issue.
*   **Procedural Errors in CA Petition:** The CA dismissed the petition based on:
    *   **Violation of Hierarchy of Courts:** Petitioners bypassed the RTC's concurrent jurisdiction by filing directly with the CA. This is a significant procedural defect under established jurisprudence.
    *   **Defective Verification:** Petitioner Epifania's failure to co-sign the verification and certification against non-forum shopping. This violates Rule 65, Sec. 1 and Rule 46, Sec. 3 of the Rules of Court.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners:** Obligation to pay rent. Obligation to vacate upon termination of the lease, subject to the court's determination of the lease period.
*   **Respondents:** Obligation to respect the terms of the valid lease agreement, as determined by the courts.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Potential liability for back rent (if any are due). Liability for costs associated with removing improvements if not considered builders in good faith.
*   **Respondents:** Potential liability for reimbursement of improvement costs if petitioners are found to be builders in good faith.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforceability of CA Dismissal:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's dismissal due to the violation of the hierarchy of courts and defective verification.
*   **Ejectment:** Petitioners face the risk of being ejected from the property.
*   **Lack of Reimbursement:** Petitioners risk not being reimbursed for improvements made on the property.
*   **Ambiguity of Lease Terms:** The oral nature of the lease and differing interpretations of its terms pose a risk of continued litigation.
*   **Statute of Frauds:** While not explicitly mentioned, the oral nature of the lease could raise Statute of Frauds issues regarding its enforceability, especially for long-term leases, as the oral contract was executed in 1946.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Pertaining to appeals by certiorari on questions of law only.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Governing certiorari petitions.
*   **Rule 46, Rules of Court:** Specifically, Section 3 regarding the contents and filing of petitions, and the effect of non-compliance with requirements (verification, certification of non-forum shopping).
*   **Section 4, par. 2 Rule 65** Rules on hierarchy of courts.
*   **Art. 448 of the Civil Code:** Relevant if the Petitioners are deemed as builders in bad faith.
*   **Alonso v. Villamor, 16 Phil. 315 (1910):** Cited regarding the liberal construction of rules but deemed inapplicable here due to substantial procedural defects.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The oral nature of the lease agreement itself is inherently ambiguous. The lack of a written document makes it difficult to definitively ascertain the parties' intentions regarding duration, rent escalation, and other key terms.
*   The determination of whether the petitioners are builders in good faith is a factual issue that will significantly impact their rights.

**Legal Precision:**

The CA ruling, affirmed by the Supreme Court, hinges on procedural deficiencies. While the underlying substantive issues (validity of the lease, good faith of the builders) remain relevant, the petitioners' failure to follow proper procedure proved fatal to their case.
