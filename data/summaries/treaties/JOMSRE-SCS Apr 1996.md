**MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM RELATING TO THE JOINT OCEANOGRAPHIC AND MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA**

**Key Provisions:**

1. **General Objectives**: The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) aims to foster goodwill and cooperation in marine scientific research in the South China Sea, particularly in the Spratlys area.
2. **Duration**: The MOU has three phases:
	* Pre-cruise preparation (from signing until April 24, 1996)

	* Post-cruise activities (10 months from the end of the scientific cruise proper)
3. **Cruise Track and Stations**: The research vessel will follow a specified track and station plan, with data and samples collected at 18 three-hour stations and 3-4 twenty-four hour stations.
4. **Terms and Conditions**:
	* Scientific components: Physical oceanography, chemical oceanography, biological oceanography, geological oceanography, and coral reef ecology
	* Contributions: Each country will provide scientific personnel, including Chief Scientists and Senior Scientists; costs for airline tickets, food, lodging, and perdiems on board the research vessel will be shared equally
	* Research vessel: The Philippines will provide the research vessel and crew, while Vietnam will assume harbor services costs
	* Equipment and supplies: The Philippines will facilitate entry into Manila of additional equipment from Vietnam
	* Insurance: Both countries will provide insurance coverage for personnel and equipment
5. **Information Exchange**: Data, information, and samples will be shared equally between the two countries.

**Key Obligations:**

1. **Scientific Cooperation**: Both countries agree to cooperate in marine scientific research in the South China Sea.
2. **Cost Sharing**: Costs for airline tickets, food, lodging, and perdiems on board the research vessel will be shared equally between the two countries.
3. **Insurance Coverage**: Both countries will provide insurance coverage for personnel and equipment.

**Key Risks:**

1. **Conflicting Claims in the South China Sea**: The MOU does not address the sensitive issue of sovereignty claims in the region, which may lead to future disputes.
2. **Unclear Boundaries**: The cruise track and station plan may be subject to interpretation, potentially leading to conflicts or misunderstandings between the two countries.

**Relevant Case Law:**

None specifically mentioned in this Memorandum of Understanding.

**Statutory References:**

None explicitly mentioned in this Memorandum of Understanding, but relevant laws related to oceanographic research, conservation, and environmental protection may be applicable.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

1. **Definition of "Cooperative Endeavors"**: The MOU does not clearly define what constitutes a "cooperative endeavor," potentially leading to disputes over interpretation.
2. **Sharing of Samples**: The MOU requires equal sharing of samples, but does not provide guidance on how to handle situations where this is not feasible or practical.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Clearer Definition of Sovereignty Claims**: Consider incorporating a clear statement addressing sovereignty claims in the South China Sea to avoid future disputes.
2. **Additional Clarity on Sample Sharing**: Consider providing more guidance on how to handle situations where equal sharing of samples is not possible or practical.
3. **Regular Review and Revision**: Regularly review and revise this Memorandum of Understanding to ensure its effectiveness and relevance in promoting cooperation and peaceful resolution of conflicts in the South China Sea.
