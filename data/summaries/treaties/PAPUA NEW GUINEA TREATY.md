These are the minutes of a meeting between the Australian and Philippine delegations for the negotiation of a trade agreement. The key points discussed during the meeting include:

1. **Scope of application**: The Australian delegation clarified that the Agreement should not apply to external territories administered by the Australian Government, but would apply to the metropolitan territory of Australia.
2. **Australian constitutional position**: The Australian delegation explained its constitutional position regarding State Governments and their role in domestic trade, which limited its ability to guarantee most-favored-nation treatment for imported goods.
3. **Limitations on the Australian Government's powers**: It was agreed that nothing in the Agreement would impose any undertaking on the Australian Government concerning matters within its constitutional powers.
4. **Quantitative import restrictions**: Both delegations accepted the principle of using quantitative restrictions only to the extent necessary to safeguard a country's external financial position and balance of payments.
5. **Most-favored-nation principles for foreign exchange reasons**: Delegations considered regulating departures from most-favored-nation principles for foreign exchange reasons by international codes of behavior, such as those of the International Monetary Fund.
6. **Handicraft and cottage industry products**: The Philippine delegation emphasized the importance of income from handicraft and cottage industry products in developing countries, leading to an agreement that these products should be included in Article VIII.
7. **State trading organizations**: Both delegations agreed on the need for an understanding on State trading organizations, including a commitment not to depart from non-discriminatory treatment principles in their purchases or sales involving imports and exports.
8. **State trading enterprise undertakings**: An undertaking was reached that if either government establishes or maintains a State trading enterprise, it would act consistently with the Agreement's general principles of non-discriminatory treatment.

These agreements provide a framework for cooperation between Australia and the Philippines in promoting fair trade practices and protecting the interests of both countries.
