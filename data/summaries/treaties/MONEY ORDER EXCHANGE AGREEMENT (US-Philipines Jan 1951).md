This is a formal treaty between two countries, in this case, the United States and the Philippines, regarding the exchange and handling of money orders. The convention outlines the rules and procedures for issuing, paying, and repaying money orders between the two countries.

Here are some key points from the Convention:

1. **Duplicate Orders**: Duplicate orders can only be issued by the Postal Administration of the paying country.
2. **Repayment**: Repayment can only be done after authorization is received from the country of destination.
3. **Voided Orders**: Orders that have not been paid within 12 months become void and are returned to the country of origin.
4. **Quarterly Accounts**: Each administration will prepare a quarterly account detailing transactions between the two countries, including amounts issued and repaid.
5. **Interim Payments**: If one administration finds its obligation exceeds $10,000, it can make an interim payment of approximately 90% of the amount due.
6. **Regulations**: Both administrations can adopt additional regulations to prevent fraud or improve system operation, as long as they are not contrary to the convention.

The Convention also includes specific procedures for:

* Notifying each other of changes in amounts owed
* Preparing and transmitting quarterly accounts
* Making interim payments
* Suspending exchange of money orders in whole or part during extraordinary circumstances

Overall, this Convention aims to establish a system for exchanging and handling money orders between the two countries, ensuring efficiency, security, and mutual cooperation.
