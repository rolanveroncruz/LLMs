## Legal Document Summary: Swiss-Philippine Debt Rescheduling Agreement (1988)

**Document:** Agreement between the Government of the Swiss Confederation and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines as the Borrower on the Rescheduling of Philippine Debts, March 25, 1988.

**Purpose:** To reschedule Philippine public debts guaranteed by the Swiss Confederation, stemming from commercial loans with original maturity over one year contracted before April 1, 1984, and falling due between January 1, 1987, and June 30, 1988. Agreement follows recommendations of the "Club de Paris" meeting of January 22, 1987.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1:** Philippines (Borrower), through the Central Bank, agrees to pay debts.
*   **Article 2:** Defines applicable debts: Public debts guaranteed by Switzerland, from commercial loans (maturity > 1 year), contracted before 1 April 1984, falling due between 1 January 1987 and 30 June 1988. Total amount capped at 15 million Swiss Francs. A separate list (not included in the document provided) specifies affected maturities and is an integral part of the agreement. Debt service from the December 20, 1984, consolidation is *not* affected.
*   **Article 3:** Reschedules principal and interest payments. 100% of the principal and 70% of the interest due between January 1, 1987, and June 30, 1988, are to be paid in 10 equal semi-annual installments, starting April 1, 1993, and ending October 1, 1997. The remaining 30% of interest is payable according to the original schedule. Interest already due but unpaid as of January 22, 1987, is payable within one month of the agreement's signature.
*   **Article 4:** Borrower assumes all financial obligations if the original debtor is a public sector entity or has a guarantee from the Philippine government or a financial public institution. The Philippine government undertakes to pay debts due but unpaid as of January 22, 1987, and guaranteed by the Swiss Export Risk Guarantee but not covered by this Agreement, within one month of signature. Guarantees immediate and unrestricted foreign exchange transfer for private debtors servicing foreign debt guaranteed by Swiss Export Risk Guarantee *not* subject to this consolidation.
*   **Article 5:** Interest accrues from the contractual maturity dates until payment at a rate of 5.5% per year, calculated on a 360-day year basis. Interest payments are due on April 1 and October 1 of each year, starting April 1, 1988.
*   **Article 6:** Payments to be made in freely convertible Swiss Francs to a designated Swiss bank (Union Bank of Switzerland, Zurich).
*   **Article 7:** Payment obligation shifts from original debtors to the Borrower. Original contractual rights and obligations between individual creditors and debtors remain in force, *except* for the payment obligation.
*   **Article 8:** Philippines undertakes to grant Switzerland treatment comparable to that accorded to other creditor nations for similar debt consolidation/rescheduling.
*   **Article 9:** Agreement effective upon signature.

**Obligations:**

*   Philippines (through Central Bank) is obligated to make the rescheduled payments of principal and interest.
*   Philippines is obligated to pay interest on the outstanding debts.
*   Philippines guarantees foreign exchange transfer for specific private debtor payments.
*   Philippines must treat Switzerland favorably compared to other creditor nations in similar debt restructuring.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability for non-payment of rescheduled debt.
*   Liability for immediate payment of pre-existing interest and debts not covered by this agreement.
*   Potential liability stemming from original contracts, to the extent not superseded by this agreement (Article 7).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Missing List:** The "separate list constituting an integral part of this Agreement" (Article 2(2)) is crucial for determining the specific debts covered and the specific amounts due. Without this list, the agreement is incomplete.
*   **Interpretation of "Comparable Terms":** The language in Article 8 ("debts of comparable terms") is ambiguous and could lead to disputes regarding whether the treatment afforded to other creditors is truly comparable. Reliance on prior interpretations of the *pari passu* principle in international debt restructurings (e.g., *Elliott Associates, L.P. v. Banco de la Nación*) may be useful but fact-specific.
*   **Concurrent Obligations:** Article 7, which retains the original contracts (except payment obligation), introduces ambiguity. It needs clarification regarding rights of creditors against original debtors if Philippine government defaults on payments.
*   **Currency Fluctuation:** While payments are in Swiss Francs, changes in currency rates could impact the actual cost to the Philippines. No mechanism addresses this risk.
*   **Force Majeure:** The agreement lacks a *force majeure* clause, which could excuse performance in unforeseen circumstances.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **General Principles of Contract Interpretation:** Philippine law governs interpretation of contracts.
*   **Sovereign Immunity:** While not explicitly waived, the act of entering this agreement implies a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to enforcement of the agreement.
*   **International Law Principles:** Principles related to sovereign debt restructuring may be applicable.
*   **Elliott Associates, L.P. v. Banco de la Nación:** (Possibly relevant to *pari passu* considerations, but fact-specific).

**Recommendations:**

*   Locate and review the missing list of specific debts covered by the agreement.
*   Clarify the impact of Article 7 on the remaining rights and obligations under the original loan agreements.
*   Consider the potential impact of currency fluctuations.
*   Evaluate the absence of a *force majeure* clause.
