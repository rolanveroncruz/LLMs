## Summary of Undertaking Between Polish Maritime Administration and Maritime Training Council

This document is an **Undertaking** between the Polish Maritime Administration (PMA) and the Maritime Training Council (MTC) of the Philippines, designed to facilitate the recognition of STCW certificates issued under Regulation I/10 of the STCW Convention 1978, as amended.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1:** Identifies the PMA and MTC as the competent authorities for Poland and the Philippines, respectively, for STCW purposes. Identifies the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) as agencies acting for the MTC.
*   **Article 2:** Grants the PMA the right to visit facilities of the Certificate Issuing Party for oversight, subject to a 30-day written notice specifying the purpose and scope of the visit (standards of competence, certificate issuance, record-keeping, medical fitness, and verification processes). *Could be contentious if the PMA's interpretation of "necessary" for visits is overly broad, potentially interfering with the MTC's autonomy. The 30-day notice provision may be insufficient for emergent situations.*
*   **Article 3:** Defines "appropriate certificates" as those compliant with STCW Regulation I/2 and includes specimen certificates for identification. *Requires ongoing monitoring to ensure certificates continue to meet STCW standards and that the "specimen certificates" accurately reflect current practice.*
*   **Article 4:** Mandates the MTC to provide the PMA with external audit reports on quality standards evaluations. *This is a crucial element for ensuring compliance and allows the PMA to rely on independent verification.*
*   **Article 5 & 6:** Establishes a verification process for certificate validity, requiring the MTC to respond to PMA inquiries within three (3) working days via nominated contact persons. *The 3-day response timeframe is tight; potential liability if this is not consistently met. Disputes could arise concerning what constitutes "validity or contents" of a certificate.*
*   **Article 7:** Obligations of the PMA to notify the MTC of any withdrawal or revocation of endorsements or recognition issued by it within two weeks.
*   **Article 8:** Requires the MTC to promptly notify the PMA of any significant changes in training and certification arrangements, including changes in responsible agencies, substantial differences communicated to the IMO under Section A-I/7 of the STCW Code, and changes to the form and substance of certificates. *Vague language such as "significant changes" could lead to disputes over reporting obligations. Failure to report could be a material breach.*
*   **Article 9:** Designates contact persons within each authority for implementation.
*   **Article 10:** Establishes consultations and negotiations as the mechanism for dispute resolution. *Lacks formal dispute resolution mechanisms such as arbitration, which may be a disadvantage.*
*   **Article 11:** Defines the process by which the Agreement shall enter into force.
*   **Article 12:** Defines the process by which the Agreement shall be ammended or revised.
*   **Article 13:** Sets a 5-year term with renewal options, subject to 30-day termination notice.

**Obligations:**

*   **MTC:** Issuing STCW-compliant certificates, providing audit reports, responding to verification requests promptly, notifying the PMA of significant changes, and maintaining contact information.
*   **PMA:** Conducting oversight visits reasonably, verifying certificate validity through established channels, notifying the MTC of endorsement withdrawals, and maintaining contact information.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Both Parties:** Potential liability for failure to comply with STCW requirements due to shortcomings in training or certification (see *The Nautical Institute v. Department of Transport* [2001] EWHC 431 (Admin) for an example of challenges to certification processes).
*   **MTC:** Exposure to liability if certificates are improperly issued or validated, leading to maritime incidents or regulatory sanctions.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Compliance Issues:** Failure of either party to maintain STCW compliance.
*   **Dispute over Interpretation:** Ambiguous clauses regarding "significant changes" or "necessary visits" may lead to disagreements.
*   **Information Security:** The reliance on email and telefax communication for sensitive information creates security risks (data breaches, impersonation).
*   **Enforcement Challenges:** Lack of a robust enforcement mechanism beyond consultation and negotiation may hinder resolution of disputes.
*   **Operational Capacity:** The ability of both parties to consistently meet the stipulated deadlines for responses and notifications.
*   **Changes in STCW Convention:** Amendments to the STCW Convention will require corresponding updates to the Undertaking.

**Relevant Law and Case Law:**

*   **STCW Convention 1978, as amended:** This is the primary source of law governing the agreement. Refer specifically to Regulations I/2, I/9, I/10, and Section A-I/7 and A-1/8 of the STCW Code.
*   **Relevant International Maritime Organization (IMO) Circulars:** MSC Circular 950 provides guidance on arrangements between STCW parties.
*   **National implementing legislation of both Poland and the Philippines.**
*   **Case Law:** Refer to cases concerning STCW compliance and certificate recognition in relevant jurisdictions.
*   **Flag State Responsibilities:** Consider case law relating to the responsibilities of flag states, which would be Poland in this context.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Article 2:** The scope of the PMA's visit rights could be interpreted broadly.
*   **Article 8:** The definition of "significant changes" is vague.
*   **Article 10:** The lack of a formal dispute resolution mechanism beyond consultation could hinder resolution.

**Recommendations:**

*   Review the Undertaking's consistency with current STCW regulations and relevant IMO guidance.
*   Clarify ambiguous terms such as "significant changes" and "necessary visits."
*   Consider incorporating a more robust dispute resolution mechanism, such as arbitration.
*   Establish clear protocols for data security and privacy.
*   Conduct regular reviews and updates to ensure ongoing compliance with STCW requirements.
