This is the text of Convention No. 29, "Forced Labour", adopted by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 1930. The convention sets out the principles for the prohibition and suppression of forced labor, and its provisions are still relevant today.

Here's a brief summary of the convention:

**Preamble**: The convention aims to establish international standards for the prohibition and suppression of forced labor, and to promote fair and equitable treatment of workers.

**Article 1**: The Convention defines forced labor as "any work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily".

**Article 2**: Member states are required to take immediate action to suppress forced labor, including:

* Abolishing all forms of forced labor
* Prohibiting the use of forced labor in industries that violate human rights
* Protecting workers from exploitation and mistreatment

**Article 3**: States must also ensure that all forms of forced labor are eradicated, including:

* Serfdom and other forms of personal servitude
* Convict labor
* Prisoner-of-war labor
* Child labor

**Article 4**: States must investigate any complaints of forced labor and take swift action to address them.

The convention also sets out procedures for ratification, registration, and denunciation, as well as guidelines for the implementation of the Convention in member states.

The convention has been ratified by many countries around the world, including all UN Member States except Somalia. While it is not an international treaty in the classical sense (i.e., it does not require domestic legislation to be implemented), its provisions have had a significant impact on the development of labor laws and human rights protections around the world.

Note: The convention has been amended several times since its adoption in 1930, with the most recent amendment being made in 1948.
