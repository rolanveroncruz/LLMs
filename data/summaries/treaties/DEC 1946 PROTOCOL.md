**Protocol Amending the Agreements, Conventions, and Protocols on Narcotic Drugs**

### Key Provisions:

*   **Amendments to International Instruments**: The Protocol amends existing international instruments relating to narcotic drugs, including the International Convention relating to Dangerous Drugs of 19 February 1925, and the International Convention for limiting the Manufacture and regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs of 13 July 1931.
*   **Continuation of Duties and Functions**: The League of Nations' duties and functions are transferred to the United Nations and the World Health Organization or its Interim Commission.
*   **Attribution of Full Legal Force**: States Parties to the Protocol must attribute full legal force and effect to the amendments to the instruments.

### Obligations:

*   **Application of Amendments**: States which are Parties to any instrument that is amended by the present Protocol are invited to apply the amended texts so soon as they become available.
*   **Provisional Functions**: The functions conferred on the World Health Organization by the amendments shall, provisionally, be performed by its Interim Commission if the amendments come into force before the organization can assume its functions.

### Liabilities:

*   **Liability for Non-Compliance**: States that fail to apply the amended texts of the instruments in a timely manner may be subject to liability for non-compliance.
*   **Consequences of Non-Ratification**: Failure to ratify or accede to the Protocol may result in loss of benefits and privileges under the international instruments.

### Potential Risks:

*   **Ambiguity in Article IV**: The provision that allows States to apply the amended texts of the instruments "as soon as possible after this Protocol has been opened for signature" creates ambiguity regarding the timing and scope of implementation.
*   **Risk of Non-Compliance with Amendments**: Failure to comply with the amendments may result in consequences, including loss of benefits and privileges under the international instruments.

### Case Law:

*   **International Court of Justice**: The International Court of Justice has jurisdiction over disputes arising from the application of the Protocol.
*   **National Courts**: National courts may also be responsible for enforcing compliance with the amended texts of the instruments.

### Conclusion:

The Protocol Amending the Agreements, Conventions, and Protocols on Narcotic Drugs establishes a framework for the amendment and implementation of international instruments relating to narcotic drugs. While the Protocol provides a clear framework for obligations and liabilities, potential risks and ambiguities arise from the application of the amendments.
