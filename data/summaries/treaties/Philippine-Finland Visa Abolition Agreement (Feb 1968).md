## Summary of Philippines-Finland Visa Abolition Agreement (1968)

**Document Type:** Bilateral Agreement (Exchange of Notes)

**Date:** February 7, 1968 (effective May 1, 1968)

**Parties:** Republic of the Philippines and Republic of Finland

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Reciprocal Visa Waiver:** Citizens of Finland and the Philippines holding valid passports are permitted entry for tourism or business without visas. Finns can stay in the Philippines for a maximum of 59 days, Filipinos can stay in Finland for a maximum of 3 months.
*   **Nordic Convention Inclusion (Filipinos visiting Finland):** The 3-month stay for Filipinos in Finland is calculated based on entry into *any* Nordic State party to the 1957 Inter-Nordic frontiers agreement, including stays in those other states within the prior 6 months.
*   **Compliance with Local Laws:** The visa waiver does not exempt citizens from complying with the laws and regulations of the host country regarding employment or professional practice (with or without compensation).
*   **Right to Refuse Entry:** Each party reserves the right to refuse entry or stay to citizens considered "undesirable."
*   **Temporary Suspension:** Either party may temporarily suspend the agreement, in whole or in part, for "reasons of public order," with immediate notification through diplomatic channels.
*   **Denunciation:** Either party may denounce the agreement with a 3-month written notice.

**Obligations:**

*   **Acceptance of Passport Holders:** Each party is obligated to allow entry to passport holders from the other party for tourism/business purposes, subject to the conditions outlined in the agreement.
*   **Notification of Suspension:** A party suspending the agreement has the obligation to notify the other party immediately through diplomatic channels.

**Liabilities:**

*   The agreement does not explicitly define "undesirable," potentially leading to arbitrary application of the refusal of entry clause (Clause 4). The parties must respect international law and norms when applying the same.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Definition of "Undesirable":** The lack of a clear definition of "undesirable" in Clause 4 could be problematic. This could lead to inconsistent application and potential challenges under international human rights law concerning fair treatment of foreign nationals.
*   **"Public Order" Suspension:** The "reasons of public order" clause for temporary suspension (Clause 5) is broad and susceptible to abuse. This could be challenged if used arbitrarily or without a justifiable basis.
*   **Nordic Convention Interpretation:** The precise application of the 1957 Nordic Convention to the 3-month limit for Filipinos in Finland requires careful interpretation and tracking of entry/exit dates in multiple Nordic countries. Could lead to disputes regarding overstay.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **International Law Principles:** International law concerning the treatment of foreign nationals, including the principles of non-discrimination and due process, would apply in interpreting and implementing the agreement.
*   **Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 (Commonwealth Act No. 613, as amended):** This Act governs immigration matters in the Philippines and would be relevant to any dispute regarding entry or stay of Finnish citizens.
*   **Finnish Aliens Act:** This Act governs immigration matters in Finland and would be relevant to any dispute regarding entry or stay of Philippine citizens.
*   **1957 Convention on the Waiver of Passport Control at the Inter-Nordic Frontiers:** Its application to the terms of this agreement (specifically Filipino entry to Finland) needs clear understanding.
*   **Possible application of VFA (Visiting Forces Agreement) as jurisprudence.**

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   Clause 4 ("undesirable") and Clause 5 ("reasons of public order") are potentially the most contentious due to their broad and undefined language. These clauses require careful monitoring to prevent abuse.
