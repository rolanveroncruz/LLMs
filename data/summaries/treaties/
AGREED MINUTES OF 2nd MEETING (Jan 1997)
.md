1. Military Cooperation
2. Reciprocal Visa Exemption for Diplomatic Passports
3. Asylum Seekers
4. Development Cooperation in the 21st Century

The agreement also covers other issues such as:

1. Establishment of a Philippine Honorary Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City
2. Regional and Global Issues (ASEAN, APEC, CTBT, UN reforms, etc.)
3. Conclusion of an MOU on Reciprocal Visa Exemption for Holders of Diplomatic Passports

The document also includes a conclusion section where both countries agree to hold the next Joint Commission Meeting in the Philippines in 1998.
