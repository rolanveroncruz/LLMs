## Summary of the 1946 Agreement Between the United States and the Republic of the Philippines Concerning Trade and Related Matters

**Overview:**

This is a summary of the 1946 trade agreement between the US and the Philippines, effective January 2, 1947, and terminated on July 3, 1974 (Article X). The agreement, partially implementing the Philippine Trade Act of 1946, aimed to facilitate trade during a transitional period following Philippine independence. It established preferential trade relations, phasing in tariffs, and setting quotas. It was amended by the Laurel-Langley Agreement in 1955.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I (Tariffs):** Phased introduction of tariffs on US and Philippine goods. From the date of entry into force until July 3, 1954, goods were admitted free of ordinary customs duty. This was followed by gradual tariff implementation from July 4, 1954, to July 3, 1974, starting at 5% and increasing annually. The tariff application was preferential; no duty was collected in an amount excess of the duty imposed with respect to like articles which are the product of any other foreign country.
*   **Article II (Quotas):** Established quotas for specific Philippine articles entering the US (e.g., sugar, cordage, tobacco). These quotas were to be allocated by the Philippines to manufacturers based on 1940 export history (or their successors). Duty-free quotas decreased incrementally from 1955 to 1973. Allocation of quota was assignable.
*   **Article III (New US Quotas):** Restricted the US's ability to impose new quotas on Philippine goods, requiring a finding of substantial competition with US products. Any quota established was not to be less than the amount of articles entering the US during the twelve months ended on the last day of the month preceding the month in which the investigation occurred. If quotas were established, the Philippines was required to allocate these quotas.
*   **Article IV (Internal & Export Taxes):** Prohibited discriminatory internal taxes on US goods in the Philippines and vice versa. No export taxes were allowed. Processing taxes were exempted for goods for official government use. Protected the coconut oil processing tax preference provided for in Section 2470 of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States.
*   **Article V (Currency):** Fixed the value of Philippine currency relative to the US dollar, prohibited suspension of convertibility, and restricted fund transfers from the Philippines to the US without US presidential agreement.
*   **Article VI (Immigration):** Granted non-quota immigrant status to certain US and Philippine citizens returning to their former country of residence, and allow entry of 1,200 US citizens into the Philippines without numerical limitations.
*   **Article VII (Natural Resources):** Granted US citizens and businesses equal rights with Filipino citizens regarding the disposition, exploitation, development, and utilization of natural resources and the operation of public utilities, subject to existing constitutional limitations (which the Philippines agreed to amend).
*   **Article VIII (Implementation):** Required both countries to enact and maintain legislation to implement the agreement, including quota allocations. Obligated the Philippines to criminalize false claims under the US Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946.
*   **Article IX (Consultation):** Mandated consultations between the US and the Philippines on interpretation or application issues.
*   **Article X (Termination):** Set a termination date of July 3, 1974, and allowed for earlier termination with written notice (5 years general, 6 months for nullification or impairment of rights). Allowed for termination if the Philippines failed to amend its Constitution regarding natural resource rights and allowed the U.S. President to suspend the agreement if there was discrimination against U.S. Citizens.

**Obligations:**

*   **US:** Grant preferential tariff treatment, refrain from establishing quotas except under specific circumstances, avoid discriminatory internal taxes, uphold currency provisions, implement immigration provisions, and consult on treaty interpretation.
*   **Philippines:** Grant preferential tariff treatment, allocate quotas, avoid discriminatory internal taxes, uphold currency provisions, implement immigration provisions, amend its Constitution regarding natural resources, assist in enforcement of US Philippine Rehabilitation Act, and consult on treaty interpretation.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Breach of Agreement:** Failure to adhere to the agreed-upon tariff rates, quota allocations, or non-discrimination provisions could lead to disputes and potential termination of the agreement.
*   **Discriminatory Taxation:** Imposing internal taxes that disproportionately burden US or Philippine products could trigger retaliatory measures.
*   **Constitutional Amendment Failure (Article VII):** The Philippines' inability to amend its Constitution to allow equal rights for US citizens in natural resources could have led to termination.
*   **Quota Management:** Improper allocation or management of quotas could lead to disputes among Philippine manufacturers.
*   **Currency Manipulation:** Violating Article V concerning currency value, convertibility, or fund transfers could lead to termination.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Philippine Trade Act of 1946 (US):** The agreement partially implemented Titles II and III of this Act.
*   **Laurel-Langley Agreement (1955):** Amended this original agreement.
*   **Sugar Act of 1937 (US):** Defined "direct-consumption sugar" (Annex I).
*   **Tariff Act of 1930 (US):** Referred to in defining cordage, yarns, and filler tobacco (Annexes II and III).
*   **Internal Revenue Code (US):** Various sections concerning oleomargarine, butter, cheese, and processing taxes on coconut oil (Annexes IV-X).
*   **Act of March 24, 1934 (US):** Relevant to immigration matters (Annex VIII).
*   **Philippine Constitution (as amended):** Referred to the definition of Philippine territory and restrictions on natural resource rights (Annex XI).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Substantial Competition" (Article III):** The subjective nature of this term could lead to disputes regarding the imposition of new US quotas.
*   **"Discrimination" (Article X):** The US President's determination of discrimination against US citizens or businesses could be subjective and lead to political tension.
*   **Determination of "Value" for imported materials:** The value of the article imported into the Philippines or the US, as defined in the protocol, is based on customs laws of the Philippines and the US in effect at the time of importation. However, no guidance is provided should the laws change over time.

**Note:** Given the termination of this agreement in 1974, its present-day relevance lies primarily in understanding the historical context of US-Philippine trade relations and potential implications for interpreting similar agreements.
