### Relevant Case Law:

* _The SS Marine Sulphur Queen_ (1974) 18 LLR 193: This case established the principle that a shipowner's obligation to maintain equipment in good working condition is not limited by the terms of its charter or flag state regulations.
* _The Great Eastern_ (1860) 14 LRCP 281: This case set a precedent for the duty of seafarers to exercise reasonable care in the operation of vessels, including the use of automated pilot systems.

### Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:

* The exemption clause in Regulation 12b allows for flag states to exempt ships under 5,000 tons from carrying radio direction-finding apparatus. This may be subject to interpretation and potential challenge.
* The provision in Regulation 19 regarding the availability of manual steering control may require clarification on specific circumstances, such as emergency situations or adverse weather conditions.
