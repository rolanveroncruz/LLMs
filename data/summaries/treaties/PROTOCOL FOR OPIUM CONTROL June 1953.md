This appears to be a translation of the Basel Convention on Hazardous Wastes and Their Safe Management, which is an international treaty aimed at reducing hazardous waste. The document outlines the terms and conditions for the implementation of the convention, including provisions for consent, coming into force, revisions, denunciations, termination, and reservations.

Here's a summary of some key points:

1. **Territorial application**: The convention applies to non-metropolitan territories with the consent of the producing State.
2. **Coming into force**: The convention comes into force when at least 25 States (including three from Asia and three from Europe) deposit their instruments of ratification or accession.
3. **Revisions**: Any Party can request revisions to the convention, which will be recommended by the Council after consultation with the Commission.
4. **Denunciations**: A Party can denounce the convention five years after its coming into force, but this does not terminate the protocol until 1 January of the following year.
5. **Termination**: If a sufficient number of Parties withdraw from the convention, it will cease to be in force.
6. **Reservations**: No Party may make reservations to the provisions of the convention, except as specifically permitted or authorized.

This document is an important international agreement aimed at reducing hazardous waste and promoting sustainable management practices.
