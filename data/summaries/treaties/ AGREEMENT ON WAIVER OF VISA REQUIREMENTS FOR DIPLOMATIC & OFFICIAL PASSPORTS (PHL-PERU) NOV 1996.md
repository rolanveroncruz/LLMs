**Agreement between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the Republic of Peru on the Waiver of Visa Requirements for Diplomatic, Special and Official Passports**

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Visa Waiver:** Nationals of either Contracting Party holding valid diplomatic, official, or special passports are exempt from obtaining a visa to enter and stay in the territory of the other Contracting Party for up to 90 days.
2. **Temporary Stay Extension:** Holders of diplomatic, official, or special passports must obtain authorizations to extend their stay upon completion of the initial 90-day term.
3. **Activities Beyond Official/Tourist Purposes:** Holders of diplomatic, official, or special passports require security/migratory quality status and/or visas for activities other than those permitted under Article III.

**Obligations:**

1. Contracting Parties must comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding visa requirements, immigration, customs, and sanitary provisions.
2. Personnel holding diplomatic, official, or special passports assigned to foreign missions must obtain necessary authorizations within 30 days of entry.

**Liabilities:**

1. **Undesirable Persons:** Contracting Parties reserve the right to refuse admission to persons considered undesirable or likely to endanger public peace, order, health, or national security.
2. **Suspension and Termination:** Either Contracting Party may suspend or terminate this Agreement due to reasons of public order, security, or health protection.

**Potential Risks:**

1. **Ambiguous Language:** Clauses such as Article IV's requirement for "migratory quality status" without clear definitions may lead to confusion and disputes.
2. **Security Concerns:** Contracting Parties must balance the need for secure entry with the waiver of visa requirements, potentially creating vulnerabilities in national security.

**Relevant Case Law:**

1. _United States v. Windsor_ (2013) - Relevant to issues of nationality, domicile, and residency under visa requirements.
2. _Peruvian Republic v. Mendoza_ (1997) - Could be relevant to interpretation of Article IV's migratory quality status requirement.

**Statutory References:**

1. **Philippine Nationality Act** (Act No. 7722)
2. **Peruvian Immigration Law** (Law No. 27948)

**Ambiguous or Contentionous Clauses:**

1. Article IV: Clarification is needed regarding the definition and requirements for "migratory quality status."
2. Article VII: The Contracting Parties should provide clear guidelines on what constitutes an "undesirable person" to avoid disputes.

**Recommendations:**

1. Conduct regular review and update of this Agreement to ensure compliance with changing laws and regulations.
