**Obligations:**

*   Each party must grant visa-free entry for qualifying passport holders per Article 2.
*   Parties are obliged to provide 30-day advance notification for diplomatic/consular assignments (Article 3).
*   Parties must exchange passport specimens and provide updates on modifications (Article 6).
*   Must notify the other party if suspending the agreement (Article 7).

**Liabilities:**

*   The agreement does not explicitly address liability for actions of passport holders while in the host country. General principles of international law and the host country's domestic laws would apply.
*   Breach of any obligation within the agreement could lead to diplomatic tension and potential suspension/termination of the agreement.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Definition of "dependents":** Article 3 refers to “dependents”. Definition of "dependents" could be ambiguous and require clarification.
*   **Interpretation of *persona non grata*:** The *persona non grata* clause (Article 5) is broad. Potential for arbitrary application and diplomatic friction.
*   **"Public order, security, or public health"** The phrase "Public order, security, or public health" are broadly worded. The meaning of "public order, security, or public health" could be subject to interpretation and potentially abused to suspend the agreement.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The agreement is based on the principle of *pacta sunt servanda*, a fundamental principle of international law requiring states to honor their treaty obligations.
*   Philippines: Relevant domestic laws regarding immigration, passport regulations, and diplomatic immunity would apply to the implementation of this agreement. [Example: Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, Revised Administrative Code].
*   Kuwait: Similar immigration laws and regulations would apply in Kuwait.
*   **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations:** While not explicitly mentioned, the Agreement is related to diplomatic relations.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The lack of specificity regarding grounds for deeming someone *persona non grata* (Article 5) could be contentious.
