**Memorandum Re: Philippines-Cyprus Merchant Shipping Agreement (1984)**

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Client:** [Client Name]

**Prepared by:** [Your Name/Firm]

**I. Executive Summary:**

This agreement (the "Agreement") between the Philippines and Cyprus, signed September 7, 1984, aims to promote cooperation in merchant shipping on a basis of equal rights and mutual benefit. It addresses vessel participation, hindrance elimination, support measures, and welfare for seamen, MFN treatment, simplification of port formalities, vessel documentation recognition, crew entry/exit, employment of seamen, and taxation of shipping profits. Key concerns arise around dispute resolution clauses, the potential for ambiguity in "best efforts" obligations, and the broad reservation of rights concerning national laws and regulations. The agreement does not address digital assets or cryptocurrency regulation, and is therefore outdated when viewed from the lens of the present day.

**II. Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1:** General agreement to cooperate in merchant shipping.
*   **Article 2:** Defines "vessel" (excluding warships, fishing vessels, etc.), "crew," and "ports."
*   **Article 4:** Promotes vessel participation in transportation, elimination of hindrances, support measures for transportation to third countries, and cooperation for seamen's welfare. The Article also reserves rights for third-state vessels
*   **Article 5:** Grants Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) treatment to vessels, crews, and cargoes of each party in the other's ports, with respect to fees, services, facilities and care.
*   **Article 6:** Requires parties to minimize vessel delays in ports and simplify formalities.
*   **Article 7:** Requires recognition of each other's vessel nationality and ship documentation.
*   **Article 8:** Vessels within the territorial waters of each state are subjected to the national regulations concerning security, safety, order, and crossing boarders.
*   **Article 9:** Defines seamen's identity documents and grants visa-free entry for temporary shore leave, departure after termination, and entry to join a vessel.
*   **Article 10:** Allows employment of each other's nationals as seamen. Disputes are subject to the *exclusive jurisdiction* of the seaman's country. States must provide graduate training.
*   **Article 11:** National laws apply to crew entry, stay, and departure. Parties reserve the right to deny entry to undesirable seamen.
*   **Article 12:** Taxation of shipping profits only in the state where the enterprise's registered office is located (international traffic); Earnings of seamen are subjected to taxation in accordance with the national laws of the Contracting Parties.
*   **Article 13:** Foreign exchange remittances subject to each party's regulations; permits transfer of earnings to the extent consistent with IMF obligations.
*   **Article 16:** Provides for the same benefits and obligations as vessels, crew and passengers in the other country following an accident.
*   **Article 19:** Establishes a Joint Commission for reviewing implementation and considering other shipping matters of mutual interest.
*   **Article 20:** Disputes to be settled through diplomatic channels, with possible recourse to the Joint Commission.
*   **Article 22:** Agreement effective 30 days after ratification notification and remains valid unless terminated with six-months notice.

**III. Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Both parties obligated to promote shipping cooperation, eliminate hindrances, and provide MFN treatment.
*   Each party is responsible for enforcing its own laws and regulations within its territory (Article 8, 11).
*   Potential liability for failure to provide agreed-upon assistance in case of shipwreck (Article 16).
*   The 'best efforts' clauses in Article 4 and Article 10 (1) introduce potential ambiguity and could lead to disputes over non-performance.

**IV. Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Best Efforts" Standard:**  The requirement to "exert its best efforts to ensure that these terms of employment are adhered to" (Article 10(1) is vague. See *Bloor v. Falstaff Brewing Corp.*, 601 F.2d 609 (2d Cir. 1979) for analysis of "best efforts" clauses. This raises enforceability issues.
*   **Exclusive Jurisdiction Clause (Article 10(2)):** While seemingly straightforward, jurisdictional clauses can be challenged based on public policy concerns or *forum non conveniens*. See *M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co.*, 407 U.S. 1 (1972) regarding the enforceability of forum selection clauses. The nationality of the seaman may give rise to the jurisdiction.
*   **Reservation of Rights (Article 8, 11):** Broad reservation of rights concerning national laws and regulations could undermine the Agreement's purpose.
*   **Dispute Resolution (Article 20):** Reliance on "diplomatic channels" is a non-binding form of dispute resolution and might prove ineffective. See *Rainbow Navigation, Inc. v. Department of Navy*, 911 F.2d 797 (D.C. Cir. 1990) for discussion of sovereign acts impacting contractual obligations.
*   **"Mutually Advantageous Basis" (Preamble):**  This is a broad principle and is difficult to define. It is not justiciable.

**V. Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Maritime Law:** Relevant principles of international maritime law and conventions (Article 18) apply.  Specifically, UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) regarding territorial waters and rights of navigation.
*   **Choice of Law and Forum:** *M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co.*, 407 U.S. 1 (1972), regarding enforceability of forum selection clauses
*   **Duty of Best Efforts:** *Bloor v. Falstaff Brewing Corp.*, 601 F.2d 609 (2d Cir. 1979)
*   **Sovereign Acts:** *Rainbow Navigation, Inc. v. Department of Navy*, 911 F.2d 797 (D.C. Cir. 1990)

**VI. Recommendations:**

*   Assess the current impact of the Agreement on clientâ€™s operations. Given the date of the agreement and the changes to maritime trade and international law since 1984.
*   Review national laws and regulations of both Philippines and Cyprus to determine potential conflicts with the Agreement.
*   Consider negotiating a more specific dispute resolution mechanism, such as arbitration, if the Agreement is to be relied upon in the future.
*   Evaluate the "best efforts" clauses and consider amending the Agreement to define these obligations more clearly.
