**Legal Summary: Agreement on the Use of the Manila Air Station (1958)**

**Document:** Exchange of Notes between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America, July 31, 1958.

**Subject Matter:** Relinquishment of the remaining area of the Manila Air Station (MAS) to the Philippine Government and its deactivation as a US Air Force installation.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Relinquishment:** The US Government formally relinquishes the remaining area of the Manila Air Station to the Philippine Government, as detailed in the attached map (not available here).
*   **Deactivation:** The MAS is officially deactivated as a US Air Force installation, effective July 31, 1958.
*   **Acceptance:** The Philippine Government acknowledges and accepts the relinquishment.
*   **Basis:** The relinquishment is pursuant to Article XXI of the Agreement of March 14, 1947 (Bases Agreement) and in accordance with prior notes exchanged on June 18, 1957 and January 27, 1958. These prior notes are critical to understanding any specifics agreed upon during prior relinquishments.
*   **Commercial Basis:** The US Government has relinquished the remaining area now that a recently signed contract for handling US military cargo through the Port of Manila on a commercial basis exists.

**Obligations:**

*   **US:** To complete the physical transfer of the land.
*   **Philippines:** To accept the land and exercise sovereignty.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Environmental:** Potential environmental liabilities stemming from the US military's prior use of the land. A comprehensive environmental audit conducted at the time of the relinquishment, and any resulting remediation, should be investigated. This may be a trigger for the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) if the US were to discover or be accused of harm to the environment post relinquishment.
*   **Title:** Clear title to the land passing to the Philippines. Any existing encumbrances or legal challenges to the title would be a liability.
*   **Contractual:** Potential liabilities arising from the "recently signed contract" for handling US military cargo. Scope, terms and conditions of the subject contract should be examined.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Interpretation of Article XXI:** The precise wording of Article XXI of the 1947 Bases Agreement should be reviewed. Article XXI may contain provisions relevant to the conditions of relinquishment, including remediation responsibilities.
*   **Ambiguity in "Remaining Area":** The definition of the "remaining area," as defined on the map, is key. Any discrepancies or ambiguities concerning the boundaries of the land being transferred could lead to disputes. The map needs to be analyzed.
*   **Unforeseen Liabilities:** Undisclosed or unknown liabilities related to the MAS. Thorough due diligence is required.
*   **Breach of Contract:** If either party fails to fulfill its obligations, a breach of agreement may occur.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Philippines-United States Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA):** While not directly referenced, the VFA and related agreements concerning jurisdiction over military personnel and facilities in the Philippines could be relevant, particularly if environmental issues arise related to past US military activities.
*   **Republic of the Philippines Constitution:** Considerations regarding the Philippinesâ€™ national sovereignty and control over its territory.
*   **CERCLA (United States):** As mentioned above, this US law has the potential to play a role if environmental contaminations are revealed.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conditions of Relinquishment:** The notes don't explicitly state any specific conditions attached to the relinquishment (e.g., environmental remediation, ongoing access). Such conditions might be referenced in the previous notes of 1957 and 1958 and/or in the underlying Bases Agreement.
*   **Definition of "Commercial Basis":** The phrase regarding the handling of US military cargo on a "commercial basis" lacks specificity. This requires more clarification.

**Recommendations:**

*   Obtain and review the referenced map showing the boundaries of the relinquished area.
*   Secure copies of the notes of June 18, 1957 and January 27, 1958 to clarify any pre-existing arrangements.
*   Conduct thorough due diligence to assess potential environmental liabilities associated with the Manila Air Station's prior use.
*   Analyze Article XXI of the 1947 Bases Agreement to determine the rights and obligations of both parties.
*   Examine the "recently signed contract" for military cargo handling to determine its impact.
