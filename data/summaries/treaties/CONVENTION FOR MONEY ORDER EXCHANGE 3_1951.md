This is a copy of the Convention on Postal Matters between the United States and the Philippines, signed in 1951. The convention establishes rules for the exchange of money orders between the two countries.

Here's a breakdown of the main points:

**Purpose**: To establish procedures for the exchange of money orders between the United States and the Philippines.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Rectification of errors**: In case of an error in the name of the remitter or payee, or when the amount needs to be returned, the interested party should apply directly to the office where the order was issued.
2. **Duplicate orders**: Duplicate orders can only be issued by the Postal Administration of the paying country and must comply with its regulations.
3. **Repayment**: Repayment shall be made by the country of issue after authorization from the country of destination, with the amount repaid credited to the former's quarterly account.
4. **Voided orders**: Orders that have not been paid within 12 months become void and revert to the country of origin.
5. **Quarterly accounts**: Each administration shall determine its course for repayment and maintain a quarterly account detailing transactions between the two countries.

**Procedure for handling voided orders**:

1. The Post office Department of the United States sends a list of postal orders issued in the Philippines that have become void to the Postal Administration of the Philippines.
2. The Postal Administration of the Philippines prepares an account showing details of orders issued and paid, including those that have become void.
3. If the balance is against the Philippines, it shall be paid by bill of exchange or Postmaster General's check; if the balance is against the United States, it shall be paid by deposit to the Philippine Republic account.

**Termination**: The convention takes effect on April 1, 1951, and remains in force for 12 months after either administration notifies the other of its desire to terminate it.
