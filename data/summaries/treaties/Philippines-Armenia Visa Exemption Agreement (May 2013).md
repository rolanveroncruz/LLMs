## Summary of RP-Armenia Visa Exemption Agreement (Diplomatic/Official Passports)

This agreement between the Republic of the Philippines (RP) and the Republic of Armenia, effective May 22, 2013, establishes visa exemption for holders of diplomatic and official passports.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1:** Visa exemption for entry, exit, and transit for holders of valid diplomatic/official passports, limited to a 90-day stay. Extensions possible upon written request from respective diplomatic/consular missions.
*   **Article 2:** Visa exemption for members of diplomatic missions, consular posts, or representative missions to international organizations, and their families (spouse and dependent children under 21) holding diplomatic/official passports, for the duration of their assignments. Requires registration with host country authorities within 90 days of entry.
*   **Article 3:** Entry/exit/transit permitted through designated international checkpoints, subject to applicable regulations of the host country.
*   **Article 4:** Obligation to observe the host country's laws and regulations.
*   **Article 5:** Reservation of the right to deny entry or shorten stay, designating individuals as *persona non grata*.
*   **Article 6:** Temporary suspension of the agreement (wholly or partially) permitted for reasons of public order, national security, or public health, subject to notification through diplomatic channels.
*   **Article 7:** Exchange of passport specimens required; notification of changes with new specimens at least 30 days prior to use.
*   **Article 8:** Amendment by mutual consent through exchange of diplomatic notes.
*   **Article 9:** Dispute resolution through consultation or negotiation.
*   **Article 10:** Indefinite term, terminable with 90 days' notice.

**Obligations:**

*   Both Contracting Parties are obligated to:
    *   Grant visa-free entry/exit/transit to eligible passport holders.
    *   Notify each other of changes to passport specifications.
    *   Follow established procedures for suspension or termination.
*   Passport holders are obligated to:
    *   Comply with host country laws.
    *   Register with authorities if covered by Article 2.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Agreement does not explicitly define liabilities. However, failure to comply with host country laws (Article 4) could result in penalties under that country's laws. The *persona non grata* provision (Article 5) allows each party to deny entry without specifying grounds beyond a broad "consideration."

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Broad "Persona Non Grata" Clause:** The broad discretion granted in Article 5 ("if it considers that person") could be abused or lead to disputes if applied inconsistently. This lack of defined criteria for *persona non grata* determinations introduces ambiguity.
*   **Suspension Clause:** The grounds for temporary suspension (Article 6) are broadly defined ("public order, national security or public health") and could be subject to expansive interpretation.
*   **Enforcement:** The agreement lacks specific enforcement mechanisms beyond diplomatic channels. Disputes arising from interpretation or application (Article 9) are subject to amicable resolution, but the agreement does not specify a binding arbitration process if consultation fails.

**Statutory References/Case Law:**

*   The agreement itself contains no direct statutory references within its body. Relevant laws of each country would pertain to immigration, diplomatic immunity (Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations), and national security. Case law may exist within each country regarding the interpretation of "public order," "national security," or application of diplomatic immunity principles, but are not explicitly tied into this agreement.
*   Relevant Philippine Laws might include: Philippine Immigration Act, Revised Penal Code, diplomatic immunity related statues.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Article 5's discretionary application of *persona non grata* status.
*   Article 6's broad grounds for temporary suspension.

**Recommendations:**

Consider clarifying the grounds for "persona non grata" designations, or require a documented process for such decisions, to prevent arbitrary application. Review relevant case law and statutory provisions to determine if any domestic legal precedents impact the interpretation or enforcement of these potentially ambiguous clauses. Consider negotiating a more defined dispute resolution mechanism should amicable consultation fail.
