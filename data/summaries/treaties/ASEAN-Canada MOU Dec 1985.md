This text appears to be a draft outline for an international seminar on energy conservation and management, likely organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The outline covers various topics related to energy policy, planning, and management, including:

1. Industrial, transportation, utility, domestic, commerce, and agriculture sectors.
2. Canadian experience and expertise in energy conservation.
3. Seminars on:
	* Electric system planning
	* Use of natural gas for electric power generation
	* Use of coal for electric power generation
	* Canadian experience with natural gas and coal
4. A wrap-up session and evaluation.
5. Study tours to Canada, focusing on:
	* Energy management, planning, distribution, and conservation (Study Tour A)
	* Coal and natural gas for electric power generation (Study Tour B)

The outline suggests that the seminar aims to promote cooperation and knowledge sharing between ASEAN countries and Canada in the field of energy conservation and management.
