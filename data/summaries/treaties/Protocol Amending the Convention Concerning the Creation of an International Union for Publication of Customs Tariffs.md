This appears to be the official text of the International Customs Tariffs Convention, which establishes the rules for contributions from member states to a international organization. Here's a summary of the key points:

**Contributions**

* Member states are required to make annual contributions to the International Customs Tariffs Bureau.
* The amounts of contributions vary by country, ranging from €26,500 (France and Germany) to €1,500 (Haiti and Paraguay).
* Countries can be divided into five classes: First Class, Second Class, Third Class, Fourth Class, and Fifth Class.

**Payment**

* Contributions are due on the first quarter of each financial year.
* Payments should be made in Belgian francs (the official currency at that time).

**Dispute resolution**

* If a member state fails to pay contributions despite reminders, the International Customs Tariffs Bureau can temporarily discontinue the dispatch of its publications to that country.

**Adoption and effectiveness**

* The Protocol was signed on December 16, 1949.
* It became effective when the aggregate annual contributions exceeded one half of the authorized budget for the year.
* States that have not signed or adjoined the Protocol may do so upon request, with the agreement of all other Contracting Parties.

**Member states**

* The list of member states as of December 31, 1965, includes countries from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.
