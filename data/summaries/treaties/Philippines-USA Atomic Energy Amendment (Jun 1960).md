## Summary of 1960 Amendment to US-Philippines Atomic Energy Agreement

This 1960 amendment modifies the 1955 "Agreement for Cooperation Between the US and the Philippines Concerning Civil Uses of Atomic Energy." It concerns the exchange of information, provision of nuclear materials, safeguards, liability, and cooperation with the IAEA.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I (Amends Art. I):** Narrows the information exchange to research reactors (design, operation, safety), and isotopes usage. *Crucially, it disclaims US warranty for accuracy, completeness, or suitability of data exchanged, shifting the responsibility of application to the Philippines.*
*   **Article II (Amends Art. II):** Modifies limits on US-supplied enriched uranium (U-235) to a maximum of 6 kg contained U-235 enriched up to 20%, plus an additional quantity for cooling fuel and transit. Requires return of spent fuel in original form (no alteration).
*   **Article III (New Art. III(A)):** Allows the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to sell or transfer research materials (source, special nuclear, byproduct, radioisotopes, stable isotopes) to the Philippines if commercially unavailable. Limits the total special nuclear material to 100g U-235, 10g U-233, 250g Pu foils/sources, and 10g Pu in other forms.
*   **Article IV (Amends Art. VI):** Strengthens Philippine safeguards obligations for special nuclear materials. Requires assurances that materials are solely for agreed purposes and reactor materials solely for research reactor design, construction and operation. Requires power level and burn-up reporting. *Critically, new paragraph D shifts liability for safe handling and use of US-supplied materials to the Philippines after delivery. Furthermore, it introduces an *indemnification clause* where the Philippines agrees to indemnify the US government against any liability arising out of the production, ownership, lease, possession, and use of US-supplied materials.*
*   **Article V (New Art. VII(A)):** Affirms a common interest in utilizing the IAEA, and commits the parties to consult to modify the agreement if desired.
*   **Article VI (Amends Art. VIII):** Extends the agreement's duration by three years (until July 26, 1963).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Philippines:** Maintaining safeguards on nuclear materials; restricting use to agreed purposes and research reactor programs; reporting power levels and fuel burn-up; allowing US observation; *indemnifying the US against all liabilities* related to the materials after delivery.
*   **United States:** Providing information and materials; limiting quantities of enriched uranium; receiving spent fuel.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Disclaimer of Warranty (Art. I):** Shifts all responsibility for the application of exchanged information to the Philippines, which could lead to disputes if the information is faulty and causes damage. Case law surrounding information sharing agreements and negligence may be relevant here.
*   **Indemnification Clause (Art. IV):** The broad indemnification clause in Article IV(2)(D) is a significant risk for the Philippines. It holds them liable for *any* cause whatsoever arising out of the nuclear materials. This could include accidents, misuse, or even latent defects in the US-supplied materials. The scope of this clause is extremely broad and could expose the Philippines to substantial financial liabilities. *Consideration should be given to force majeure, acts of war, or unforeseen circumstances and whether these should be specifically excluded from the indemnity.*
*   **Safeguards and IAEA:** While expressing interest in the IAEA, the agreement's provisions could be superseded by stricter IAEA regulations in the future, potentially leading to conflicts.
*   **Limited U-235 Quantity:** The specific limit on U-235 may restrict the scope and type of research activities feasible.

**Statutory References:**

*   This agreement modifies a 1955 agreement. The relevant US statutory authority for these agreements likely stems from the Atomic Energy Act (as amended). The current version should be consulted for consistency.
*   The agreement references the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and therefore, statutes pertaining to US participation and obligations related to the IAEA are relevant.

**Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The phrase "efficient and continuous operation of the reactor or reactors" in Article II(B) could be subject to interpretation and potential disputes.
*   The phrase "Materials of interest" needs to be clarified regarding the scope of the agreement in terms of Atomic Energy undertaking by the Philippines, or persons under its jurisdiction

**Recommendations:**

*   Review the Atomic Energy Act and current IAEA regulations.
*   Analyze the potential financial exposure under the indemnification clause, including insurance options.
*   Consider negotiating a narrower indemnification clause that excludes force majeure events and limits liability.
*   Seek clarification on the "efficient and continuous operation" phrase.
*   Seek to have "Materials of interest" clarified regarding the scope of the agreement.
