## Summary of MOA on Procurement of Thai White Rice (2014-2016)

**Document:** Memorandum of Agreement between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand on the Procurement of Thai White Rice, dated September 12, 2014.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Purpose:** Establishes a government-to-government framework for the Philippines to purchase Thai white rice to enhance economic relations, ensure market stability, and promote rice security.
*   **Volume:** Grants the Philippines the *option* (not an obligation) to purchase up to 1 million MT of Thai white rice annually from 2014-2016. Purchases are contingent on market demand, supply, production conditions, and international market prices.
*   **Implementing Agencies:** Designates the National Food Authority (NFA) of the Philippines and the Department of Foreign Trade (DFT) of Thailand as the respective implementing agencies. DFT must have a proven track record in similar G2G transactions within the last 5 years.
*   **Procurement Process:** Outlines a procurement process involving the Royal Thai Government submitting offers, review and evaluation by the Philippine Government, and price negotiations. Specifies a 10-day negotiation period and a 15-day limit, after which the Philippine Government is free to reject the offer.
*   **Restrictions:** Contract awarded to DFT cannot be assigned or performed by any third party, except by Public Warehouse Organization (PWO) which is a state-owned enterprise under the Ministry of Commerce of Thailand. Third-country sourcing is prohibited.
*   **Market Stability:** Both parties commit to implementing measures to curb illegal rice trading.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** Any divergence arising from the interpretation or implementation of this agreement shall be resolved amicably through consultations and negotiations between the Parties.
*   **Amendments:** Amendments require mutual agreement and written proposals with a 60-day response period.
*   **Term and Termination:** Effective upon signing and ratification, valid until December 31, 2016, with a renewal clause. Either party can terminate with a 6-month written notice, which will not affect any already completed sales or purchases.

**Obligations:**

*   The Royal Thai Government is *willing to sell* rice to the Philippines if the Philippines chooses to buy.
*   The Philippine Government has the *option to buy* rice from Thailand, with no firm commitment to purchase any specific quantity.
*   Both parties are obligated to negotiate in good faith on price.
*   Both parties are obligated to cooperate in curbing illegal rice trading.
*   Designated implementing agencies (NFA and DFT) are obligated to perform their roles in accordance with the agreement.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Breach of Contract:** While there's no fixed purchase obligation, failure to negotiate in good faith or failure by DFT to deliver rice according to agreed terms could lead to claims of breach of contract under international trade law.
*   **Price Volatility:** Reliance on "international market price" opens the Philippine government to risks associated with price fluctuations. The agreement lacks a price escalation or risk mitigation clause.
*   **NFA's Authority & Capacity:** Given the NFA's history of controversies and potential governance issues (related to RA 11203, which amended the NFA's charter), its capacity to effectively implement the agreement should be reviewed.
*   **DFT's Proven Track Record:** The clause requiring DFT to have a proven track record in similar government-to-government transactions within the latest 5-year period requires due diligence to verify the information.
*   **Force Majeure:** The agreement lacks a *force majeure* clause, which is a standard provision excusing performance due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., natural disasters). This could lead to disputes if supply is disrupted.
*   **Applicable Law:**  The agreement is silent on the governing law in case of a dispute, which could lead to jurisdictional issues if a formal dispute resolution process is initiated beyond amicable consultations.
*    **Ratification:**  The agreement will need to be ratified by relevant authorities in both countries. Failure to ratify could nullify the agreement.
*    **Third-Party Rights:** The agreement does not discuss whether parties have third-party rights.
*   **Interpretation Risks:**  The phrases "subject to market demand, supply and production conditions" is ambiguous and can open to different interpretations, as it does not provide clear guidance on what would constitute a basis for non-performance due to supply issues.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Philippine Procurement Law (RA 9184):** While this is a G2G agreement, principles of transparency and accountability under Philippine procurement law may be relevant, particularly regarding price reasonableness.
*   **General Principles of International Trade Law:**  Principles of good faith, *pacta sunt servanda* (agreements must be kept), and remedies for breach of contract under international trade law.
*   **NFA Charter (RA 11203):** RA 11203 amended the NFA's mandate. Any potential conflict of this MOA with the NFA's existing charter needs to be examined.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Subject to market demand, supply and production conditions":** This clause provides broad discretion to both parties to potentially avoid performance.  Further definition is necessary to avoid disputes.
*   **"Standard international trade practices, rules, regulations and procedures.":** This clause should be explicitly defined, which may avoid conflicting interpretation of certain terms.
*   **"Illegal Rice Trading":** A clause for stricter measures in accordance with their respective laws and regulations needs further specification of clear metrics and enforcement mechanism.
*    **"Shall be renewed upon approval of both Parties.":** No guidelines are mentioned how "approval of both parties" will be achieved.

**Recommendations:**

*   Conduct due diligence on DFT's track record.
*   Consider negotiating a price escalation/de-escalation clause.
*   Include a *force majeure* clause.
*   Clarify the governing law in case of disputes.
*   Review and assess any conflict of interest.
*   Clearly define metrics and enforcement mechanism for illegal rice trading.
*   Implement strict internal controls within the NFA to ensure compliance and prevent irregularities.
