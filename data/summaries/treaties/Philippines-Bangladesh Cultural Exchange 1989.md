**Memorandum Regarding Cultural Exchange Programme Between the Philippines and Bangladesh (1989-1990)**

**Date:** October 10, 1989

**Summary:** This document constitutes an executive program implementing the broader Cultural Agreement signed in 1980 between the Philippines and Bangladesh. It outlines specific cultural exchange activities planned for 1989-1990, encompassing education, historical studies, art, culture, sports, radio, television, film, and press. The program establishes financial responsibilities and mechanisms for further consultations and amendments.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Exchange Programs:** Mandates cooperation between universities, exchange of scholars, cultural troupes, artists, and sports teams. Includes exchange of news, radio/TV programs, and documentary films.
*   **Exhibitions:** Authorizes exhibitions of paintings and handicrafts, with the receiving country liable for costs associated with damage or loss. *Note* that there are no explicit provisions on insurance requirements.
*   **Intellectual Property:** Grants telecast rights to receiving countries for exchanged programs and documentary films, placing responsibility for format conversion on the recipient.
*   **Financial Terms:**  Establishes a split responsibility for expenses: Sending party covers international travel/freight, while receiving party covers internal expenses (board, lodging, local travel, emergency medical). Cost of postage and freight borne by sending party. Import duties, if any, borne by the recipient.
*   **Amendment Clause:** Allows for additions or omissions to the program through further consultations between the respective foreign affairs ministries.
*   **Term:** The program is effective upon signing and terminates on December 31, 1990.

**Obligations:**

*   Each party is obligated to facilitate the agreed-upon exchanges within their respective countries.
*   Financial obligations are clearly defined in Section IV.
*   Recipient country of exhibitions is obligated for the costs of loss or damage.
*   Recipient of media materials has the obligation to convert formats and ensure rights are guaranteed in writing.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Exhibition Damage/Loss:** The receiving country bears financial liability for damage or loss to exhibited artwork/handicrafts.  The absence of detail on valuation could be problematic.
*   **Beyond Agreement:** The Sending country will shoulder expenses for any retention of its delegation's period of stay in the host country beyond the period stipulated in the Executive Agreement, for whatever reason.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity in "Established Practices and Procedures":** Section I referring to education and historical studies is vague and may lead to disputes about the scope and implementation of exchanges.
*   **Lack of Specificity:** The agreement lacks detailed provisions regarding dispute resolution, force majeure, or governing law.  It relies heavily on "mutual consent" which, if not attained, could stall the implementation.
*   **Intellectual Property Issues:** The agreement addresses telecast rights but lacks specifics on copyright ownership, licensing for other uses, and protection against unauthorized distribution or modification of exchanged materials. *See* *Berne Convention*, to which both countries are parties.
*   **Valuation of Art/Handicrafts:**  No defined mechanism exists for valuing artwork or handicrafts in case of damage or loss during exhibitions, potentially leading to disputes over compensation.
*   **Definition of "Emergency":** "Medical treatment during emergency" is undefined and could be subject to broad interpretation, potentially leading to disputes over covered medical expenses.
*   **Limited Duration:** The program's short duration (approximately 14 months) might limit the scope and impact of the intended cultural exchange.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **General Principles of Treaty Interpretation:** International law principles on treaty interpretation, such as the *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*, would apply to resolve any ambiguities or disputes.
*   **Copyright Laws:** The copyright laws of both the Philippines and Bangladesh are relevant to the exchange of media materials. The Universal Copyright Convention and the Berne Convention may apply.
*   **Contract Law:** While this is an international agreement, general principles of contract law regarding offer, acceptance, and consideration can be applied by analogy.

**Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The phrases "appropriate Governmental channels," "established practices and procedures," and "mutual consent" are vague and require clarification to avoid misunderstandings.
*   The lack of detail on intellectual property rights beyond telecast rights.
*   The absence of a dispute resolution mechanism could lead to protracted negotiations or reliance on diplomatic channels.

**Recommendations:**

*   Seek clarification on the ambiguous terms mentioned above through further communication with the relevant parties.
*   Consider drafting supplementary agreements to address intellectual property rights, dispute resolution, and valuation of exchanged items.
*   Ensure appropriate insurance coverage for exhibitions to mitigate the risk of financial loss due to damage or theft.
*   Establish a clear protocol for managing medical emergencies for participating individuals.
*   Ensure compliance with relevant copyright laws in both countries.
