The Exchange of Notes between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America, dated October 31, 1972 (Note No. 659), amends the Agricultural Commodities Agreement (May 16, 1971) to increase the Maximum Export Market Value of rice from $14,775 thousand to $21,000 thousand.

**Key Provisions:**

* The agreement increases the total maximum export value of the agreement from $42,623 thousand to $48,848 thousand.

* The amendments are effective as of the date of this note in reply.

**Obligations:**

* Both parties agree to abide by the terms and conditions outlined in the amended agreement.
* No further obligations or commitments are specified beyond the agreed-upon changes.

**Liabilities:**

* None explicitly stated; however, both parties may be liable for breach of contract if they fail to fulfill their obligations under the amended agreement.

**Potential Risks:**

* Ambiguous language regarding the effective date of the amendments and potential disputes over interpretation.
* Risk of non-compliance with the agreed-upon changes, potentially resulting in trade disruptions or financial losses.

**Relevant Case Law:**

* No specific case law referenced in the document; however, relevant principles may be applied from international trade agreements and contract interpretation laws (e.g., [UN Convention on the Law of Treaties](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/pt/ctisindex.aspx) and [International Court of Justice](https://icj-cij.org)).

**Statutory References:**

* 23 UST 3487 (published reference for the Agreement)

**Ambiguous or Contingent Clauses:**

* The agreement does not explicitly address scenarios where either party fails to fulfill their obligations under the amended terms.
* Potential disputes may arise from unclear language or conflicting interpretations of the amendments.

In conclusion, while this Exchange of Notes appears to be a straightforward amendment to the Agricultural Commodities Agreement, its ambiguous language and potential for dispute highlight the need for careful interpretation and adherence to contractual obligations.
