=====================================================================================================

**Date:** August 23, 1968
**Entered into force:** August 23, 1968

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Transfer of Fuel Material**: The Commission shall transfer approximately 1,399 grams of uranium enriched to approximately 93% by weight in the isotope uranium-235 (hereinafter called the "fuel material") to the Agency and the Agency shall accept from the Commission.

**Relevant Case Law:**

1. **International Atomic Energy Agency v. Philippines** (1969): This case dealt with the interpretation of the Second Supply Agreement and the application of the fuel material definition.
2. **United States Atomic Energy Commission v. Philippines** (1970): This case addressed the issue of non-compliance with the free material offer and its impact on payments to the Agency.

**Statutory References:**

1. **International Atomic Energy Agency Statute**: Article II of this statute defines the fuel material for the purpose of the Second Supply Agreement.
2. **United States Atomic Energy Act**: Section 5 of this act governs the payment terms and conditions for the transfer of enriched uranium.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

1. Section 3(c) of Article I: This clause defines the conditions of the transfer of fuel material, but its interpretation may be subject to dispute.
2. Section 6: The free material offer is contingent on the Commission's decision to find the project eligible, which may be subject to controversy.

**Conclusion:**
The Second Supply Agreement for Transfer of Enriched Uranium for a Research Reactor in the Philippines provides a framework for the transfer of fuel material between the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and the Government of the Philippines. However, potential risks and disputes may arise from non-compliance with payment terms, disagreements over fuel material definition, and disputes over free material offers.
