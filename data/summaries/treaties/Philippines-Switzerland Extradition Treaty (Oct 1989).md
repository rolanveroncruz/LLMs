## Summary of RP-Switzerland Extradition Treaty (1989) for Legal Counsel

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1 (Obligation to Extradite):** Establishes the core obligation to extradite persons wanted for prosecution, sentencing, or enforcement of deprivation of liberty orders for extraditable offenses, provided the treaty's conditions are met.
*   **Article 2 (Extraditable Offenses):** Defines extraditable offenses as those punishable by imprisonment or deprivation of liberty for at least one year in both states. Requires at least six months of sentence remaining for enforcement requests. Allows extradition for offenses punishable by less than one year to the extent permitted by the Requested State. Includes a broad definition of "offense" considering totality of actions. Addresses extraterritorial offenses, making extradition mandatory for nationals of the Requesting State and discretionary for non-nationals. Contains a retroactivity clause contingent on the action being an offense in both states at the time of the request, and at the time of commission.
*   **Article 3 (Exceptions to Extradition):** Mandatory exceptions include political offenses (excluding attempts on Heads of State), persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or political belief, purely military offenses, prior final judgments, and offenses barred by statutes of limitations. Discretionary refusal includes offenses relating exclusively to currency, trade, or economic policy; offenses intended to reduce taxes or duties; nationality of the person sought; jurisdiction of the Requested State over the offense; and offenses punishable by death in the Requesting State (unless assurance against execution is given).
*   **Article 4 (The Request and Supporting Documents):** Specifies required documentation (warrants, statements of offenses, descriptions of acts/omissions, relevant laws, and penalty information), requiring authentication as per Article 5. Allows for extradition with consent despite non-compliance with documentation requirements. Addresses language of document translations.
*   **Article 7 (Provisional Arrest):** Allows for provisional arrest via INTERPOL or other means in urgent cases, outlining the necessary information to be included in the request and the conditions for release after 40 days if a formal extradition request is not received.
*   **Article 8 (Conflicting Requests):** Establishes criteria for determining which state will receive the extradited person in cases of multiple requests, including seriousness of offenses, timing and location of offenses, request dates, nationality, habitual residence, and the possibility of re-extradition.
*   **Article 12 (Rule of Speciality):** Restricts prosecution in the Requesting State to offenses for which extradition was granted, unless the Requested State consents or the extradited person has had the opportunity to leave the Requesting State and hasn't done so.
*   **Article 17 (Settlement of Disputes):** Provides for consultations and, failing that, referral to the International Court of Justice for disputes concerning interpretation of the treaty, without affecting domestic executive or judicial decisions.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Both states are obligated to extradite under defined circumstances.
*   The Requested State bears the costs of extradition proceedings and detention until surrender (Article 15).
*   The Requesting State bears the costs of conveying the person from the Requested State (Article 15).
*   The Requested State must represent the interest of the Requesting State in extradition proceedings (Article 15).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Political Offense Exception (Article 3(1)(a)):** Interpretation of "political offense" is a potential source of dispute. The treaty mitigates this slightly by excluding attempts on Heads of State, but definitional disagreements remain possible, potentially opening the door to politically motivated denials.
*   **Economic Offenses (Article 3(2)(a)):** Broad language regarding offenses related to currency, trade, or economic policy provides discretion for refusal and could be subject to varying interpretations.
*   **Nationality Exception (Article 3(2)(b)):** Discretion to refuse extradition of nationals could be problematic if the Requested State frequently exercises this right.
*   **Rule of Speciality (Article 12):** Enforcement and interpretation of the "opportunity to leave" clause could be contentious.
*   **Article 2(2):** "To the extent permitted under the law of the Requested State," introduces potential ambiguity in the granting of extradition for less serious offenses, and provides the Requested State with discretion.
*   **Retroactivity Clause (Article 2(5)):** The clause's proviso that the act also be illegal in the Requested State creates a potentially heavy burden of proof.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   Domestic extradition laws of both the Philippines and Switzerland will govern the procedural aspects of extradition, as the treaty primarily sets forth the framework for granting extradition requests. Reference must be made to Republic Act No. 6975 and the Philippines Rules of Court in the Philippines, and the relevant Swiss Federal Laws.
*   Case law interpreting "political offense" in extradition treaties will be relevant when applying Article 3(1)(a).

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The subjective interpretation of "political offense" and the discretion afforded to the Requested State in refusing extradition based on nationality, economic offenses, or jurisdiction.

**Recommendations:**

*   Careful analysis of the specific facts of each extradition request in light of the treaty provisions.
*   Thorough documentation supporting the request, complying strictly with Article 4.
*   Proactive engagement with the Requested State to address potential concerns and clarify ambiguities in the treaty's interpretation.
*   Preparation for potential challenges based on the political offense exception or discretionary refusal grounds.
