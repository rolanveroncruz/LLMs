This document appears to be a plan of operation for a malaria eradication program in the Philippines, as part of the World Health Organization's (WHO) efforts. The plan is divided into several sections:

1. **Objectives**: The program aims to eliminate malaria in the Philippines by 1970.
2. **Passive Case Detection**: A system will be established to detect and report cases of malaria through passive case detection posts, which are located in strategic areas across the country.
3. **Active Surveillance**: Active surveillance involves searching for suspected malaria cases in communities and collecting blood samples for testing.
4. **Training**: Training will be provided to personnel involved in the program, including sector technicians, microscopists, and health workers.
5. **Studies**: Observations will be made on the response of P. falciparum to camoquine and primaquine, as well as studies on the role of A. litoralis as a malaria vector.
6. **Government Commitments**: The Philippine government has committed to provide funding for the program in the amount of P10,217,455 per year for 1969 and 1970.
7. **WHO Commitments**: WHO will provide personnel, fellowships, supplies, and equipment to support the program.

The plan also includes a few final provisions, such as:

* The Addendum will come into effect upon signature by the parties concerned and will remain in effect until December 31, 1970.
* A thorough assessment of the program's progress will be made during the last three months of the period covered by this Addendum to inform future planning.

Overall, this plan outlines a comprehensive approach to malaria eradication in the Philippines, with multiple components aimed at detecting and controlling the disease.
