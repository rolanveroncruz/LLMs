These are regulations related to the transportation of pilgrims on ships and aircraft, focusing on their health and safety. Key points include:

1. **Daily provision of water**: Pilgrims shall be provided with clean drinking water daily, free of charge.

2. **Medical care**: The ship's surgeon must visit pilgrims daily, inspecting their quarters, food, water supply, latrines, etc., to ensure they are kept in good hygiene conditions.

3. **Proper waste disposal**: Measures for disinfection and sterilization shall be taken regularly to prevent the spread of diseases.

4. **Confidentiality**: Only authorized personnel, like the ship's surgeon, should have access to patients suffering from infectious diseases to prevent cross-contamination.

5. **Death on board**: If a pilgrim dies during the voyage, their cause of death must be recorded, and if they died from an infectious disease, their body must be buried at sea after proper disinfection.

6. **Exemptions for short sea voyages**: Pilgrim ships engaged in short sea voyages may have different requirements agreed upon by local states.

7. **International aviation regulations**: The health administration of a country may require an aircraft carrying pilgrims to land only at designated airports within its territory.

These regulations are part of an international agreement aimed at ensuring the health and safety of pilgrims during international travel by sea or air.
