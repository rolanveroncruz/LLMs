This is a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Greek Authority and the Philippine Authority regarding the reciprocal recognition of certificates of competency for seafarers, as required by the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Code). The MOU outlines the procedures and requirements for recognizing certificates issued by each country's authority.

Here are the key points from the MOU:

1. **Reciprocal recognition**: The Greek Authority will recognize certificates issued by the Philippine Authority, and vice versa.
2. **Endorsements**: The Greek Authority will not issue endorsements that recognize or attest certificates issued by other countries' authorities, except for those issued by the Philippines Authority under this MOU.
3. **Training requirements**: The Greek Authority requires its personnel to undergo training on relevant legislation before issuing endorsements.
4. **Non-citizenship**: The Greek Authority will not endorse certificates held by non-citizens of the Philippines.
5. **Suspension or revocation**: If either authority decides to suspend, revoke, or withdraw recognition of a certificate, it must notify the other authority within 60 days.
6. **Implementation and duration**: The MOU enters into force after a three-month notice period, as per EU Directive 98/35/E.C., and remains in effect for five years unless denounced by either party.

The MOU is signed by:

1. Captain (H.C.G.) Exarchopoulis Panagiotis, Head of the Seafarers Training Directorate of the Greek Ministry of Mercantile Marine.
2. Patricia A. Sto. Tomas, Secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment and Chairperson of the Maritime Training Council.

The MOU is signed in two originals in English on January 8, 2003, in Piraeus, Greece, and Manila, Philippines.
