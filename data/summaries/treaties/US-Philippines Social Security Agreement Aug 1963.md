This text appears to be a diplomatic exchange between the United States and the Philippines, specifically regarding the participation of Philippine employees in the U.S. Social Security System. The documents are related to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that outlines the terms and conditions for the system's implementation.

Here is a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Context**: The Philippines is seeking recognition from the United States as an equal partner in the social security system, rather than just a recipient of benefits.
2. **Agreement**: The two governments agree to implement participation in the Philippine Social Security System by U.S. armed forces for the benefit of their non-U.S. civilian employees.
3. **Key provisions**:
	* The U.S. armed forces will make deductions from covered employees' wages and remit them to the system together with employer contributions.
	* The U.S. government will provide self-audit and self-inspection, but not external audit or inspection.
	* Fiscal transactions between the U.S. armed forces and the system will be in Philippine pesos.
4. **Recognition**: The Philippines enacts Republic Act 3839 to permit foreign governments to enter into agreements with the Philippine Government for inclusion of employees in the Social Security System, except those already covered by the U.S. Civil Service Retirement System.

The documents show a typical diplomatic exchange between two countries, where they negotiate and agree on terms and conditions for cooperation or participation in a system. The language is formal and technical, indicating that both parties have expertise in international relations and social security law.
