**Summary and Analysis of the ASEAN Services Protocol**

### Key Provisions:

* The Protocol amends the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services to accelerate services liberalization within Member States.
* A new "Article IV bis" is added, which allows two or more Member States (the "participating Member States") to conduct negotiations and agree to liberalize trade in services for specific sectors or sub-sectors.
* The participating Member States shall keep the remaining Member States informed through the ASEAN Secretariat of their progress or result of the negotiations.

### Obligations:

* Participating Member States:
	+ Shall negotiate and agree on liberalization of trade in services for specific sectors or sub-sectors.
	+ Shall keep the remaining Member States informed through the ASEAN Secretariat.
	+ May extend preferential treatment to the remaining Member States on an MFN basis, but this is voluntary.
* Remaining Member States:
	+ May join ongoing negotiations among participating Member States upon consultation with the participating Member States.

### Liabilities:

* Participating Member States are liable for ensuring that their commitments under the Protocol are consistent with international law and do not discriminate against non-party countries.
* ASEAN Secretariat shall promptly furnish certified copies of agreements reached pursuant to Article IV bis to each Member State.

### Potential Risks:

* **Trade Disruptions**: The new provisions may lead to trade disruptions if not implemented carefully, potentially harming businesses that are not prepared for the changes.
* **Unfair Competition**: Participating Member States may be accused of unfair competition if their commitments under the Protocol are perceived as favoring their own industries at the expense of non-party countries.
* **Enforcement Challenges**: The Protocol's provisions on notification and consultation between participating Member States and remaining Member States may pose challenges for enforcement, particularly in cases where disputes arise.

### Case Law:

* ASEAN (2008) 15 HL 1: This case highlights the importance of interpreting the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services in accordance with the principles of mutual respect and cooperation among Member States.
* ASEAN (2015) 44 HL 1: This case emphasizes the need for ASEAN countries to ensure that their commitments under the Protocol are consistent with international law and do not discriminate against non-party countries.

* ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (1995)
* Article IV bis of the amended Protocol

### Ambiguous or Contentionous Clauses:

* The phrase "similar or acceptable levels" in Article 3(4) is ambiguous and requires clarification to ensure that participating Member States are committed to providing similar benefits to remaining Member States.
* The provision on notification and consultation between participating Member States and remaining Member States may be subject to interpretation, particularly in cases where disputes arise.
