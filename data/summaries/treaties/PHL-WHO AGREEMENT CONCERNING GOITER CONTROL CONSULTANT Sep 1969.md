**Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the World Health Organization Concerning a Request for Consultant for the Goiter Control Project**

### Key Provisions:

*   The agreement establishes the terms of reference for a consultant in the field of nutrition (goiter control) to assist the Health Department in evaluating, planning, and studying goiter control measures.
*   The Basic Agreement between WHO and the Government (1950) governs the implementation of this request and outlines the respective obligations of WHO and the Government.

### Obligations:

*   The Government is responsible for providing:
    *   A counterpart to work with and assist the consultant during his assignment
    *   All available background documentation relative to the consultant's duties
    *   Provision of transport within the country, if required
    *   Secretarial services, if required
*   WHO is responsible for:
    *   Providing a consultant in the field of nutrition (goiter control)
    *   Meeting all costs and expenses associated with the consultant's assignment

### Liabilities:

*   The Government shall insure WHO, its advisers, agents, and employees for civil liability under the laws of the country in respect of any vehicles provided for use in meeting this request.

### Potential Risks:

*   **Ambiguous Clauses:**
    *   The agreement does not clearly outline the scope of work or the specific responsibilities of the consultant.
    *   The provision for insurance coverage may be subject to interpretation and may not provide adequate protection for WHO's interests.
*   **Relevant Case Law:**
    None notable. However, the Supreme Court E-Library provides guidance on various Philippine laws and regulations.
*   **Statutory References:**
    *   Republic Act No. 6755 (Philippines Public Service Act)
    *   Section 14 of The Code of Civil Procedure (Philippines)

### Recommendations for Lawyers:

*   Review the agreement to ensure that it accurately reflects the scope of work and responsibilities of the consultant.
*   Consider drafting an addendum or amendment to clarify any ambiguous clauses or provide additional protections for WHO's interests.
