**MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES AND THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON SUPPORTING THE CONDUCT OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES FOR MAJOR PROJECTS**

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Financing and Support**: The Chinese side agrees to provide financing and/or support through dispatch of technical experts and consultants to undertake Feasibility Studies for Major Projects in support of priority projects of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines.
2. **Procedure**: The Philippine side submits a request for conduct of Feasibility Study to the Chinese side, which then evaluates and issues its decision. The Chinese side dispatches technical experts and/or consultants to undertake the preparation and conduct of the Feasibility Study under the guidance of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines.
3. **No Binding Obligation**: The provision and conduct of the Feasibility Study does not necessarily bind or obligate either party to finance a project resulting from the Feasibility Study.

**Obligations:**

* The Philippine side must submit applications for support under this MOU within its validity period.
* Both parties may supplement and modify this MOU at any time, subject to mutual written consent.

**Liabilities:**

* Neither party is liable for any losses or damages arising from the conduct of Feasibility Studies or the provision of financing and/or support under this MOU.

**Potential Risks:**

1. **Ambiguous Language**: Article 3's statement that "the provision and conduct of the Feasibility Study does not necessarily bind or obligate" may be interpreted as ambiguous, potentially leading to disputes over what is considered a binding obligation.
2. **Data Sharing and Capacity Building/Technology Transfer**: The MOU's provisions on information exchange, use of data, requirement for capacity building/technology transfer, and other areas are not clearly defined, which could lead to misunderstandings or disagreements between parties.

**Relevant Case Law:**

* None directly applicable, but principles of international cooperation and agreement can be inferred from general principles of law.

**Statutory References:**

* None explicitly mentioned, but may be relevant under the Philippines' International Trade Act of 2000 and other related laws.
* China's relevant laws on trade, investment, and international cooperation should also be considered.

**Ambiguous or Contingent Clauses:**

1. Article 4's provision that applications after expiry date shall only be accepted if validity is extended in writing between both parties hereto may be seen as ambiguous, particularly regarding the timing and process of such extensions.
2. Article 5's requirement for mutual written consent to modify this MOU may be subject to interpretation, potentially leading to disputes over the scope and effect of any modifications.

**Recommendations:**

1. Close scrutiny should be applied to Articles 3 and 4 to ensure clarity on binding obligations and application processes.
2. The parties should consider seeking advice from international lawyers and experts familiar with trade, investment, and international cooperation agreements.
3. Regular communication and coordination between the Department of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce would help prevent misunderstandings and facilitate effective implementation of this MOU.
