This is an excerpt from a tax convention between Norway and the Philippines, specifically Article 27 on Exchange of Information. It outlines the rules for sharing information to carry out the purposes of the Convention and domestic laws concerning taxes covered by the Convention.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Exchange of information**: The competent authorities of both countries shall exchange such information as is necessary to carry out the visions (purposes) of the Convention.
2. **Restrictions on exchange of information**: The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1, and any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under domestic laws.
3. **Use of exchanged information**: Such persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment or collection of taxes covered by the Convention shall use the information only for such purposes.
4. **Prohibition on disclosure**: The exchange of information shall not impose on a Contracting State the obligation to supply information that:
	* Contradicts the laws or administrative practice of that or other Contracting State.
	* Is not obtainable under domestic laws or in the normal course of administration.
	* Would disclose trade, business, industrial, commercial, or professional secrets or information contrary to public policy (ordre public).
5. **Diplomatic and consular officials**: Nothing in the Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic or consular officials under general rules of international law or special agreements.

These provisions aim to promote cooperation between the two countries for the effective collection and exchange of tax information, while respecting each country's laws and administrative practices.
