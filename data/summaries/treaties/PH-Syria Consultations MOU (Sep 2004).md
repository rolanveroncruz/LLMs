## Summary of Philippines-Syria Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

**Document:** Memorandum of Understanding on Consultations between the Department of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Philippines and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic (September 12, 2004).

**Nature:** A non-binding MOU intended to facilitate consultations and cooperation between the foreign affairs ministries of the Philippines and Syria.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1:** Establishes a general framework for mutual contact and consultation on bilateral, regional, and international issues.
*   **Article 2:** Provides for consultations between the Ministers of Foreign Affairs or their representatives through visits and meetings, particularly during UN General Assembly sessions.
*   **Article 3:** Details regarding logistics of consultations (level, date, venue, schedule) will be determined through diplomatic channels.
*   **Article 4:** Calls for consultations on agendas of international conferences of mutual participation.
*   **Article 5:** Mandates diplomatic missions to the UN, international organizations, and third countries to widen cooperation and information exchange.
*   **Article 6:** Promotes development of contacts among other governmental organizations involved in international relations.
*   **Article 7:** Sets the entry into force upon written notification of completion of domestic requirements.
*   **Article 8:** Establishes term of validity unless terminated by either party with a 30-day notification period.

**Obligations:**

*   The document creates a *soft* obligation to consult, but no concrete legal duties. Obligations are limited to good faith efforts to communicate and cooperate.
*   The parties are obligated to use diplomatic channels for arrangements and notifications.

**Liabilities:**

*   Since it's an MOU, it's not legally binding under international law in the same way as a treaty. There is no legal liability for failing to consult or cooperate, though it could damage diplomatic relations.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforceability:**  As an MOU, it lacks the legal force of a treaty. It's essentially a statement of intent.
*   **Ambiguity:**  The language regarding the "necessity" of consultations (Art. 2 & 4) creates ambiguity and depends on subjective interpretation.
*   **Political Considerations:**  Changes in government or political priorities in either country could render the MOU irrelevant. The ongoing conflict and political instability in Syria poses a significant risk.
*   **Lack of Specificity:**  The MOU lacks specific provisions defining the scope of "issues of common interest," potentially leading to disagreements about the agenda of consultations.

**Relevant Law:**

*   **International Law Principles:**  Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (though not directly applicable, it offers context on treaty interpretation). Consider the principles of *pacta sunt servanda* and good faith.
*   **Customary International Law:**  General principles of international cooperation and diplomacy.
*   **Philippine Law:**  Executive Order 459 requires the concurrence of the Senate in the ratification of treaties. *Commissioner of Customs v. Eastern Sea Trading* 3 SCRA 351 (1961) provides jurisprudence for Executive Agreement. As this is an MOU, it falls within the President's executive power regarding foreign affairs but it would not require Senate ratification.

**Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   "As may be necessary" (Article 2) and "If necessary" (Article 4) weaken the obligation to consult.
*   The phrase "issues of common interest" (Article 1) is broad and open to interpretation.

**Advice:**

The MOU is largely symbolic. Its value lies in establishing a framework for communication and goodwill. Counsel should advise their client that this is a non-binding agreement and that adherence depends on the political will of both parties. Any reliance on specific outcomes from this MOU would be speculative.
