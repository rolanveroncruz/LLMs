Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided Protocol:

**Document:** Protocol between Norway and the Philippines amending the 1987 Double Taxation Convention (DTC), signed May 22, 1989.

**Summary:**

This Protocol amends the 1987 Norway-Philippines DTC. Key provisions relate to the taxation of employment income earned in international transport.

**Key Provisions & Changes:**

*   **Article I (Amendment to Article 15, paragraph 3 of the Convention):**
    *   Replaces the original paragraph regarding taxation of employment income from international transport.
    *   **General Rule:** Remuneration for employment aboard ships/aircraft in international traffic can be taxed in the state where the *operator* is resident.
    *   **Exception 1 (N.I.S. Registered Ships):** Income from employment aboard ships registered in the *Norwegian International Ships Register* (N.I.S.) is taxable *only* in the recipient's state of residence. This is a significant carve-out favoring Norwegian-registered shipping.
    *   **Exception 2 (SAS Aircraft):** Income derived by a Norwegian resident from employment aboard aircraft operated in international traffic by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) is taxable *only* in Norway. This exception specifically favors the SAS consortium and Norwegian residents employed by them.

*   **Article II (Amendment to Article 29, paragraph 2 of the Convention):**
    *   Replaces the original paragraph regarding the entry into force.
    *   The Convention shall enter into force upon the exchange of instruments of ratification and its provisions shall have effect in respect of taxes on income or on capital relating to the calender year (including accounting periods beginning in any such year) in which the Convention enters into force.

*   **Article III:** Specifies ratification process (exchange of instruments in Manila) and states the Protocol shall enter into force upon the exchange of instruments of ratification and its provisions become effective in respect of taxes on income or on capital relating to the calender year (including accounting periods beginning in any such year) in which the Convention signed in Manila on 9 July 1987 enters into force.
*   **Article IV:** Protocol's duration is tied to the 1987 Convention's duration.

**Obligations:**

*   Both countries obligated to ratify the Protocol.
*   Both countries obligated to apply the amended provisions regarding the taxation of income from international transport.

**Liabilities:**

*   Non-compliance with the amended treaty could lead to disputes regarding taxation and potential double taxation scenarios, requiring resolution under treaty dispute mechanisms (likely within the primary 1987 DTC, although this Protocol doesn't specify such mechanisms).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "Operator":** The term "operator" (Article I) requires careful interpretation. Does it refer to the registered owner, bareboat charterer, or another entity? This ambiguity could lead to disputes. Case law defining "operator" in similar contexts (maritime or aviation law) should be considered.
*   **"International Traffic":** The definition of "international traffic" could be relevant and may be defined in the original treaty or need to be interpreted based on OECD commentary (if applicable).
*   **N.I.S. Registry:** The specific rules governing the N.I.S. registry (Norwegian International Ships Register) are important. Understanding the criteria for registration and potential changes to those criteria is essential.
*   **SAS Consortium:** The reference to the "SAS consortium" needs clear definition. Any changes in the structure or ownership of SAS could impact the application of this exception.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Philippine Tax Code:** Relevant provisions regarding income taxation and treaty application.
*   **Norwegian Tax Law:** Relevant provisions regarding income taxation and treaty application.
*   **Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:** Principles of treaty interpretation.
*   **OECD Model Tax Convention & Commentaries:** While not binding, these are often used for interpreting DTCs, particularly regarding definitions and concepts not explicitly defined in the treaty itself.
*   **Case Law:** Relevant case law from both jurisdictions interpreting similar DTC provisions or related tax principles.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The N.I.S. and SAS exceptions could be viewed as preferential treatment or "treaty shopping" mechanisms, potentially raising concerns about fairness or compliance with general principles of tax law.

This summary provides a starting point for legal analysis. A full assessment would require examining the original 1987 DTC, relevant domestic laws, and applicable case law/OECD guidance.
