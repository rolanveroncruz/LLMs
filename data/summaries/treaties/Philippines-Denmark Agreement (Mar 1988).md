Allows for alteration of Annexes (repayment schedules) through agreement between the parties (Central Bank of the Philippines and Government of Denmark or Danish Export Credit Council). Danish Kroner debt mentioned is denominated on the due date for each individual debt into US dollars at the official fixing rate quoted in Copenhagen on February 29, 1988.
*   **Article 4:** Addresses interest. Restructured Loans are interest-free. Interest on restructured Commercial Credits is payable semi-annually (April 1 and October 1) starting April 1, 1988. The initial interest rate is 7.2%. Subsequent rates are based on a formula tied to the London Interbank Market rate for Euro-dollar deposits plus a margin (7/16 of one percent).

*   Denmark: Restructuring debt per Article 2.

**Liabilities:**

*   Philippines: Potential liability for breach of repayment terms. Liability for amounts owed pursuant to pre-existing agreements not covered under this restructuring.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Economic Downturn:** The Philippines' ability to meet the repayment schedule could be affected by economic instability.
*   **Exchange Rate Fluctuations:** While the Agreement considers exchange rates, significant fluctuations could impact the cost of repayment for the Philippines.
*   **Interpretation Disputes:** Ambiguity in interpreting the MFN clause (Article 9) or the scope of "comparable" debts could lead to disputes.
*   **Force Majeure:** The Agreement does not appear to address potential events of force majeure that could impact repayment.

**Statutory References:** N/A (Primarily a contractual agreement between two sovereign nations).

**Relevant Case Law:** N/A (Typically, debt restructuring agreements are governed by international law principles of contract and state responsibility. Disputes would likely be resolved through negotiation or international arbitration).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Article 9 (MFN Clause):** The definition of "debts comparable in nature" is open to interpretation and could be a source of dispute if the Philippines enters into more favorable restructuring agreements with other countries.
*   **Absence of Force Majeure Clause:** The lack of a force majeure clause leaves open the possibility of disputes if unforeseen circumstances (e.g., natural disasters, political instability) prevent the Philippines from fulfilling its obligations.

**Recommendations:**

*   Clarify the interpretation of "debts comparable in nature" within Article 9.
*   Consider the implications of the absence of a force majeure clause and potentially negotiate an amendment addressing such events.
*   Monitor the Philippines' economic performance to assess the risk of default and potential need for further restructuring.
