## Summary of Supplemental Agreement No. 3 (FAO and Philippines, 1952)

This is a summary of Supplemental Agreement No. 3, executed November 14, 1952, between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Government of the Philippines (GOP) regarding technical assistance for rice improvement, supplementing the Basic Agreement of October 26, 1950.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Purpose:** To provide technical assistance on rice improvement (breeding, production, storage, processing).
*   **Assistance Type:** Short visits (normally not exceeding three months) by FAO experts ("the Personnel") to the Philippines. Any further assistance (equipment, fellowships) requires a new supplemental agreement.
*   **Counterpart:** The Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources of the Philippines is the primary contact point for all matters related to this agreement.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **FAO Obligations:** Provide technical assistance via expert visits and pay subsistence allowances to the Personnel, per Technical Assistance Board guidelines. Subject to available funding.
*   **Government Obligations:** Provide and pay for in-country transportation for the Personnel. **Specifically exempted from paying subsistence allowances to the Personnel**, despite Article III(b) of the Basic Agreement requiring this.
*   **No prejudice:** FAO's obligations under this agreement don't affect any existing or future supplemental agreements.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Vagueness of "Appropriate" Assistance:** Article I(a) states the Organization will provide the Government with such technical assistance and advice on rice improvement including such measures as breeding, production, storage and processing "as may be determined by the Organization to be appropriate." The open-ended nature of the technical assistance and the Organization's sole discretion in determining what is "appropriate" could lead to disputes regarding the scope and adequacy of the assistance provided.
*   **Funding Availability:** The agreement is explicitly contingent on the availability of funds to the FAO, creating potential uncertainty. No mechanism is provided to address a scenario where funding becomes limited or unavailable.
*   **Definition of "Subsistence Allowances":** The agreement references subsistence allowances paid by the Organization to the Personnel as those prescribed from time to time by the Technical Assistance Board. It is unclear if the definition of the Technical Assistance Board will be the operative definition moving forward in cases of disputes.
*   **Enforceability:** Being an agreement between a sovereign nation and an international organization, the enforceability may present jurisdictional challenges.

**Relevant Considerations:**

*   **International Rice Commission:** The agreement relies heavily on the context of the International Rice Commission (IRC) and its prior meetings and recommendations. Understanding the IRC's constitution, mandates, and operational procedures is crucial for interpreting this agreement.
*   **FAO's Mandate:** The agreement is rooted in FAO's mandate to promote agricultural development and food security. Disputes might be resolved by referring to FAO's own internal guidelines and policies on technical assistance programs.
*   **State Immunity:** As a specialized agency of the UN, FAO may be entitled to certain immunities and privileges. This could affect the GOP's ability to bring legal action against FAO.
*   **Good Faith Obligation:** The agreement implies a good faith obligation on both parties to cooperate and facilitate the provision of technical assistance. Unreasonable obstruction or delay by either party could be considered a breach of this obligation.

**Further Investigation:**

*   Review the Basic Agreement of October 26, 1950, incorporated by reference.
*   Research the Technical Assistance Board's current guidelines on subsistence allowances.
*   Investigate the legal status of the International Rice Commission and its relationship with FAO.
*   Examine any subsequent agreements or amendments related to this agreement.
