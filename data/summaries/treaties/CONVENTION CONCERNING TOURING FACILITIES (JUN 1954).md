The provided text appears to be an excerpt from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, also known as the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. This convention was adopted in 1961 and is an international treaty that sets out rules for diplomatic relations between countries.

Section 32 of the convention states: "No Contracting State shall be required to extend to a State making a reservation the benefit of the provisions to which such reservation applies."

And Section 40 states: "Any dispute between two or more Contracting States concerning the interpretation or application of this Convention shall so far as possible be settled by negotiation between them. Any dispute which is not settled by negotiation shall be submitted to arbitration if any one of the Contracting States in dispute so requests..."

These provisions outline the procedures for settling disputes and resolving issues related to diplomatic relations between countries.

However, I must note that the text also includes a large number of other sections, such as Articles 33-44, which cover topics such as:

* The deposit of ratifications and accessions (Article 33)
* Notification of denunciations (Article 36)
* Abrogation of the convention (Article 37)
* Entry into force of amendments (Article 42)
* Notifying member states and other states (Article 43)
* Authentication of the text (Article 44)

These sections provide further details on the procedures for implementing and managing diplomatic relations between countries.
