**Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) Summary: Philippines (DOE) and Myanmar (MRE) on Renewable Energy (December 5, 2013)**

This MOA outlines a framework for cooperation between the Philippines' Department of Energy (DOE) and Myanmar's Ministry of Energy (MRE) in the field of renewable energy.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Objectives (Article 1):** Collaboration on research, design, development, and demonstration of renewable energy technologies (solar, biogas, biomass, geothermal, small hydro, wind, waste-to-energy, tidal ocean), as well as preparation and implementation of a Programme for Cooperation.
*   **Areas of Cooperation (Article 2):** Joint R&D, demo facilities, expert exchange, training, information networking/exchange, financial assistance solicitation/extension, and identification of national partners.
*   **Contributions (Article 3):** Reciprocal exchange of experts, technical assistance, financial support coordination, demonstration unit setup, documentation, and coordination of efforts involving public and private sector entities.  Includes provisions for third-party inclusion (NGOs, Universities, etc.).
*   **Joint Committee (Article 4):** Establishes a committee to execute and monitor the Programme for Cooperation, to meet annually, identify activities, coordinate scientific and commercial development, and consider further cooperative activities. International travel covered by sending country; internal travel and medical by host country.
*   **Status Property (Article 5):** Equipment and facilities fully owned where located after project completion, unrestricted utilization and access during project.
*   **Information (Article 6):** Information exchange in English, confidentiality restrictions, and evaluation/reporting requirements.
*   **Project Results (Article 7):** Non-patentable research results freely utilized by either party, entitled to publish results.
*   **Patents (Article 8):** Decisions on patents and IP rights arising from activities under the agreement will be decided on a case-by-case basis.
*   **Warranty and Liability (Article 9):** No warranty for correctness of information or condition of materials/equipment exchanged; no liability for damages arising from their use.
*   **Dispute Settlement (Article 10):** Disputes resolved through mutual consultations.
*   **Amendments (Article 11):** Amendments require agreement through diplomatic channels.
*   **Commencement (Article 12):** Enters into force upon written notification of completion of domestic requirements.
*   **Termination (Article 13):** Terminable by either party with three months' written notice.

**Obligations:**

*   Each party has reciprocal obligations to provide expertise, financial support coordination, technical assistance, and resources to implement the Programme for Cooperation.
*   Both parties are obligated to participate in the Joint Committee, share information, and evaluate project results.
*   Both are obligated to coordinate with local partners in the implementation of the agreement.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Limited Liability (Article 9):**  Key provision limiting liability. The MOA explicitly states that neither party assumes warranty for the information or equipment provided and is not liable for damages resulting from their use. This significantly limits potential legal recourse for issues arising from the cooperation.
*   **Confidentiality Obligations (Article 6):** Breaching confidentiality obligations related to restricted information could lead to liability.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Enforceability:** As a memorandum of agreement, it's crucial to determine the extent to which its provisions are legally binding under Philippine and Myanmar law.  A MOA often expresses intent to collaborate rather than creating firm legal obligations.  A court interpreting this document would likely consider the language, intent of the parties, and any subsequent actions taken pursuant to the agreement.
*   **Financial Commitment:**  The agreement mentions financial support, but the exact financial obligations of each party are unclear. Ambiguity exists regarding the level and timing of financial contributions which could lead to disputes.
*   **Intellectual Property:** The vague language in Article 8 regarding patents and intellectual property rights could lead to disputes.  The absence of clear ownership or licensing terms creates ambiguity. Case-by-case determination can be problematic.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** Reliance on "mutual consultations" (Article 10) may be insufficient for resolving complex disputes. Consider alternatives like arbitration.
*   **Termination:** The termination clause is standard, but the impact of termination on ongoing projects or investments needs to be carefully considered.

**Relevant Law and Case Law:**

*   **Philippine Contract Law (Civil Code):**  The general principles of contract law will govern the interpretation and enforceability of this MOA.
*   **International Agreements:** Treaties and agreements entered into by the Philippines are governed by the principles of international law. *Commissioner of Customs vs. Eastern Sea Trading*, G.R. No. L-14279, October 31, 1961, provides insight on treaty interpretation.
*   **Renewable Energy Act of 2008 (Republic Act No. 9513):**  This act governs the development and promotion of renewable energy in the Philippines and would be relevant to any activities conducted in the Philippines under this MOA.
*   **Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:** While not strictly a treaty, principles of treaty interpretation under the Vienna Convention may be considered when interpreting this MOA.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Article 3:** Lack of specific financial commitments.
*   **Article 8:** Vague terms regarding patent and intellectual property rights. The phrase “case to case basis” lacks clarity.
*   **Article 9:** While limiting liability, the breadth of the limitation might be challenged depending on the specific circumstances.

**Recommendations:**

*   Clarify the financial obligations of each party.
*   Develop specific terms regarding intellectual property ownership and licensing.
*   Establish a more robust dispute resolution mechanism.
*   Assess the MOA's enforceability under Philippine and Myanmar law.
*   Document the Program for Cooperation in detail, with clear goals, timelines, and allocation of resources.

This summary provides a legal overview. A thorough legal analysis would require a deeper examination of the laws of both jurisdictions, the specific projects undertaken, and the actions of the parties.
