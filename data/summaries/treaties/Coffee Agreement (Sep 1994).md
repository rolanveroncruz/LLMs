This is a draft text of the International Coffee Agreement 1994, an international treaty that governed the coffee market and trade between countries. The agreement was signed on April 18, 1994, at the United Nations headquarters in New York.

The text outlines the terms and conditions of the agreement, including:

1. Article 47: Duration and Termination - The agreement shall remain in force for a period of five years unless extended or terminated by mutual consent.
2. Article 48: Amendments - The Council may recommend amendments to the agreement, which must be accepted by at least 75% of the exporting countries holding 85% of the votes and at least 75% of the importing countries holding 80% of the votes.
3. Article 49: Supplementary and Transitional Provisions - The agreement shall continue the International Coffee Agreement 1983, as extended, with some modifications.

The text also includes a provision for the authentic texts of the agreement to be in four languages (English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish) and that the originals be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Finally, the page includes a certification by the Executive Director of the International Coffee Organization (ICO), confirming that the text is a true and complete copy of the agreement.

The agreement was intended to address issues related to coffee production, trade, and market stabilization, but it ultimately failed to achieve its goals due to disagreements among member countries.
