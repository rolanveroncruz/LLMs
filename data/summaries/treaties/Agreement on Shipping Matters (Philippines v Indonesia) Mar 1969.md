**Summary of the Agreement on Shipping Matters between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of Indonesia**

**Key Provisions:**

* The agreement aims to encourage the use of commercial flag vessels from both countries for import and export commodities.
* Both governments will take steps to conclude agreements among shipping companies, associations, and organizations to implement this objective.
* Merchant vessels calling at ports in the other country shall enjoy treatment no less favorable than that accorded by their respective laws, rules, and regulations.

**Obligations:**

* The Philippine government is obligated to encourage its shipping lines to provide adequate capacity and frequency on a regular basis to meet demand for sea transport.
* The Indonesian government is also obligated to take positive measures to encourage cooperation and assistance arrangements in respect of technical and managerial aspects of ship operations and maintenance.

**Liabilities:**

* There is no explicit liability clause in the agreement, but it implies that both governments are expected to fulfill their obligations as stated in Article 1.
* Any disputes arising from the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement shall be resolved through consultation between the two governments (Article 5).

**Potential Risks:**

* The lack of a clear dispute resolution mechanism may lead to ambiguity and potential for conflict if interpretations diverge.
* The agreement's reliance on cooperation and mutual understanding may not guarantee compliance, particularly in cases where one party fails to fulfill its obligations.

**Relevant Case Law:**

* None mentioned in the document, but relevant case law may be cited in disputes arising from this Agreement.

**Statutory References:**

* Article 5 of the "TRADE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA"
* Articles II, IV, and V of the "BASIC AGREEMENT ON ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA"

**Ambiguous or Contentionous Clauses:**

* Article 7, which sets a two-year period of effectiveness for the Agreement, does not specify what constitutes "successive" periods and how they should be calculated.
* The notice period for termination is set at six months, but it is unclear whether this notice can be given during the first two-year period of effectiveness.

**Recommendations:**

* Both governments should establish a clear dispute resolution mechanism to address any disputes arising from the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement.
* Regular consultations and cooperation between the two governments are essential to ensure successful implementation of the Agreement.
* The definition of "successive" periods in Article 7 should be clarified through negotiation or amending the agreement.
