## Legal Summary: Record of Discussions Between Philippines and Japan Aeronautical Authorities (Sept. 18, 2004)

**Document Type:** Record of Discussions (ROD) supplementing the Air Services Agreement between Japan and the Philippines (Jan. 20, 1970).

**Key Provisions:** This ROD details amendments to the air traffic rights between the two countries, specifically regarding route schedules, capacity/frequency entitlements, and code-sharing arrangements.

**Obligations & Entitlements:**

*   **Route Schedule (Annex C):** Defines permissible routes for designated airlines of each country. Key changes include:
    *   Philippines designated airlines can operate to/from Nagoya after Chubu Centrair International Airport opens.
    *   All-cargo operations of each country are allowed 3rd/4th freedom traffic.

*   **Capacity/Frequency Entitlements:**
    *   Each country is allowed up to 52 weekly round trips (DC-8/B707/B727 equivalents).
    *   Restrictions on Philippine carriers operating to/from Fukuoka and "another point in Japan other than Nagoya".
    *   Additional 7 weekly round trips between Philippines and Osaka for either country.
    *   Limited beyond-territory frequencies with traffic rights (8 total).
    *   All-cargo services beyond the other territory are allowed (4 frequencies).
    *   Fifth freedom passenger traffic restrictions (60 passengers per one-way flight) if beyond-territory frequencies exceed 6. Reporting requirement for fifth freedom passengers.
    *   Additional frequencies granted if either country unilaterally operates to points beyond the other's territory.
    *   No increase in IATA slot allocation at Narita airport.
    *   Japan allowed 14 weekly round trips to/from Diosdado Macapagal International Airport and/or Subic Bay International Airport.
    *   Aircraft coefficients are used to determine capacity usage (Annex C). Wide-bodied aircraft restriction via Taipei for Japanese carriers.

*   **Code Sharing:**
    *   Designated airlines can enter code-sharing arrangements with other airlines, subject to aeronautical authority approval.
    *   Capacity calculation based on aircraft coefficient, except when the designated airline is a marketing airline on the route. Simultaneous commencement of code-sharing is required.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Breach of Frequency Limits:** Exceeding the agreed-upon frequency limits could result in penalties and potential revocation of operating permits. *See, e.g., cases involving violation of bilateral air service agreements and potential recourse under customary international law or dispute resolution mechanisms within the original 1970 agreement.*
*   **Fifth Freedom Violation:** Failure to comply with the fifth-freedom passenger limitation and reporting requirements could lead to financial penalties and/or restrictions on operating beyond territory.
*   **Code Sharing Approval:** Failure to obtain necessary aeronautical authority approval for code-sharing agreements would render such arrangements illegal and subject to regulatory sanctions. *Likely governed by domestic aviation laws and regulations of both Japan and the Philippines.*
*   **"Another Point in Japan" Ambiguity:** The language referring to "another point in Japan other than Nagoya" is vague and requires clarification via subsequent agreements or operational practice. *This ambiguity could lead to disputes regarding permissible routes and frequencies.*
*   **Aircraft Coefficient Miscalculation:** Incorrect application of aircraft coefficients could result in inadvertent breach of capacity limits.
*   **IATA Slot Coordination Non-Compliance:** Violating IATA slot coordination requirements at Narita Airport could have repercussions independent of this ROD. *Governed by IATA rules and local airport regulations.*
*   **Provisional Operations Risk:** The clause allowing operations "on a provisional basis" prior to exchange of diplomatic notes creates a period of legal uncertainty. Operations during this period could be challenged prior to full ratification.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   This ROD relies heavily on the original Air Services Agreement between Japan and the Philippines signed on January 20, 1970 (Article 8, Article 11 and Article 13).
*   Domestic aviation regulations of both countries (Japan and the Philippines) govern the approval processes for designated airlines and code-sharing agreements.
*   International Air Transport Association (IATA) rules related to slot coordination are relevant.
*   Potentially applicable is customary international law relating to treaties, good faith performance (pacta sunt servanda), and state responsibility. *See Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Articles 26 and 27.*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   "Another point in Japan other than Nagoya to be specified later" is unclear and subject to interpretation.
*   The phrase "with full traffic rights unless otherwise stipulated in the new Schedule" in paragraph 2b is ambiguous. Clarification might be needed.

**Recommendations:**

*   Seek clarification on the "another point in Japan other than Nagoya" provision through formal diplomatic channels.
*   Implement internal controls to ensure compliance with frequency limits, fifth-freedom restrictions, and reporting requirements.
*   Ensure all code-sharing agreements are formally approved by relevant aeronautical authorities.
*   Accurately calculate aircraft coefficients and closely monitor capacity usage.
*   Consult with IATA regarding slot coordination at Narita airport.
*   Monitor progress on the exchange of diplomatic notes to formally ratify the ROD.
