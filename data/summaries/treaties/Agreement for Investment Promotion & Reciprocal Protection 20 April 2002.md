This is the text of a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between the Republic of Austria and the Republic of the Philippines. The treaty outlines the terms and conditions for investments made in each other's territories, including dispute settlement mechanisms.

Here's a summary of the key provisions:

1. **Dispute Settlement**: The treaty establishes procedures for resolving disputes between investors and host states, as well as disputes between the Contracting Parties themselves.
2. **International Arbitration**: Investors can submit disputes to international arbitration under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) or a UNCITRAL-arbitrated tribunal.
3. **Recognition and Enforcement**: The treaty requires each Contracting Party to recognize and enforce arbitral awards in accordance with its national laws and regulations.
4. **Investment Protection**: The treaty guarantees the protection of investors' rights, including fair and transparent treatment, equal treatment under the law, and compensation for expropriation or breach of contract.
5. **Fair and Equitable Treatment**: The treaty requires host states to provide fair and equitable treatment to foreign investors, which includes protecting them against arbitrary or unjustified actions.
6. **National Treatment**: The treaty guarantees national treatment for foreign investors, meaning they should be treated as if they were domestic investors in terms of access to government contracts, services, and other benefits.
7. **Most-Favored-Nation Treatment**: The treaty requires host states to provide most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment to foreign investors, which means they should be treated better than their own citizens or other foreign investors.
8. **Dispute Settlement within Six Months**: Disputes between the Contracting Parties themselves must be settled through negotiations within six months; otherwise, they can be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.

The treaty also includes provisions for its entry into force, duration, and termination, as well as a clause requiring that any investment made prior to the date of termination of the present Agreement should continue to benefit from the protection afforded under this Agreement.

Overall, this BIT aims to provide a stable and predictable environment for investments between Austria and the Philippines by guaranteeing fair treatment, protecting investors' rights, and providing mechanisms for resolving disputes.
