The order creates the Department of Agrarian Reform and appoints its officials, including the Secretary of Finance as chairman of the board of investments, the Chairman of the National Economic Council as a member, and other personnel. It also authorizes the release of $1,281,935 from the Special Fund for Education to establish a permanent trust fund, which will be used for agrarian reform education programs.
