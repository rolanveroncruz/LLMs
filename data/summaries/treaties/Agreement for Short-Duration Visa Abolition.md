**Summary of the Agreement Between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of France for the Abolition of Visas of Short Duration**

### Key Provisions:

*   Citizens of both countries can enter and leave each other's territory without a visa, as long as they possess a valid passport.
*   The agreement applies to sojourns of up to 59 days. Prior application for a visa is still required for stays exceeding 59 days or for lucrative activities.

### Obligations:

1.  Citizens of both countries must have a valid passport to enter and leave each other's territory without a visa.
2.  The French government reserves the right to refuse entry or sojourn in its territory to citizens of the Philippines it considers as undesirable.
3.  The agreement requires diplomatic notification in cases of suspension due to security, public order, or public health concerns.

### Liabilities:

*   France may be liable for damages if a citizen of the Philippines is denied entry or sojourn due to discriminatory reasons.

### Potential Risks:

1.  **Ambiguous Clause**: Article 5's provision that allows one party to refuse entry based on "undesirability" raises concerns about potential discrimination.
2.  **Suspension Provisions**: The temporary suspension of the agreement for security, public order, or public health reasons may lead to disputes between the parties.

### Relevant Case Law:
