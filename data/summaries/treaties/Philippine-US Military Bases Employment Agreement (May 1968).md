## Summary of 1968 RP-US Agreement on Employment of Philippine Nationals in US Military Bases

**Overview:** This agreement, entered into force on May 27, 1968, governs the employment of Filipino citizens by the United States Armed Forces within US military bases in the Philippines. It addresses labor relations, terms and conditions of employment, right to self-organization, and provides a dispute resolution mechanism. The agreement is supplemental to, and contingent upon the continued validity of, the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, as amended.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I (Employment Standards):**
    *   **Preferential Employment:** Requires the US Armed Forces to prioritize the employment of Filipino citizens except in specific circumstances such as when skills are unavailable locally, for security reasons, or special management needs. It also excepts third-country nationals already employed on the date of entry into force of this Agreement and in the case of technical personnel of third country nationality as envisaged in paragraphs 1 and 2, Article XI of the Military Bases Agreement of 1947, as amended.
    *   **Uniform Standards:** Mandates uniform terms and standards of employment for all employees, regardless of nationality, subject to collective bargaining and national laws.
    *   **Overtime Compensation:** Explicitly requires overtime pay for work exceeding the regular workday/week, as defined by Philippine law (Agreed Minute 3).
    *   **Security of Employment:** Requires US Armed Forces to endeavor to provide security of employment. Priority consideration for employment is extended to affected employees.
    *   **Severance Pay:** Entitles employees involuntarily terminated (except for cause) to severance pay. (Agreed Minute 5 clarifies that military requirements can be cause for separation with severance pay.)

*   **Article II (Right to Self-Organization and Collective Bargaining):**
    *   Guarantees Filipino employees the right to self-organization and collective bargaining.
    *   Provides for recognition of labor organizations representing the majority of employees. Voluntary checkoff of dues.
    *   Establishes a process for dispute resolution involving the Joint Committee outlined in Article III. Strikes or disruptions before the Joint Committee's final action may constitute grounds for withdrawal of recognition.

*   **Article III (Joint Committee):**
    *   Establishes a Joint Committee composed of representatives from both governments to resolve disputes that cannot be settled through regular grievance procedures.
    *   The Joint Committee's primary function is to facilitate settlement between parties.

*   **Article IV (General Provisions):**
    *   Requires contractors and concessionaires to comply with Philippine labor laws.
    *   Preserves sovereign immunity for both governments.
    * Base authorities shall facilitate access by appropriate Philippine government officials to sites where such contractors work, upon prior request and proper Identification.

*   **Article V (Mid-Year Annual Bonus):**
    *   Mandates a mid-year bonus for Filipino employees.

*   **Article VI (Entry into Force):**
    *   Agreement to enter into force upon signature or within six months, depending on required administrative action.
    *   Provides for revision and termination in conjunction with the Military Bases Agreement.

**Obligations:**

*   The US Armed Forces must prioritize Filipino employment and adhere to uniform labor standards.
*   Both governments are obligated to participate in the Joint Committee process.
* Contractors and concessionaires are obligated to comply with Philippine Labor laws and regulations.
*   The US Armed Forces must facilitate access to Philippine Government officials in sites where the contractors work.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Disputes over "Security" and "Special Management Needs":**  Article I(1) provides exceptions to preferential employment that could be subject to abuse or differing interpretations.  This could lead to disputes regarding the bona fides of the employer's claim and potential grievances.
*   **Potential for Unfair Labor Practices:**  While the agreement guarantees the right to self-organization, potential for interference, coercion, or discrimination still exists. (Article II (1)).
*   **Ambiguity in Dispute Resolution Process:** The Joint Committee process, while designed to facilitate settlement, may be ineffective if either party is unwilling to compromise. The definition of "final action" (Article II(3)) requires clarity to avoid premature withdrawal of recognition of the Labor organizations.
*   **Enforcement of Contractor Compliance:** While contractors are required to comply with Philippine labor laws (Article IV), enforcement responsibility rests with Philippine authorities (Agreed Minute 8). The US Armed Forces only commit to facilitating access. This may result in inadequate enforcement.
*   **Duration tied to Military Bases Agreement:** The Agreement's lifespan is directly tied to the Military Bases Agreement. Termination or significant amendment of the Military Bases Agreement could render this Agreement moot.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The Military Bases Agreement of 1947, as amended, is the foundational document. Case law interpreting that agreement would likely be relevant here.
*   Philippine Labor Code (Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended) and related laws are applicable to contractors and concessionaires.
*   US Labor Laws and regulations (e.g., concerning terms of employment for US nationals) will also be applicable as outlined in agreed minutes.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Special Management Needs" (Article I(1)):** The term "special management needs" (explained in Agreed Minute 1) is broad and could be used to circumvent the preferential employment provision.
*   **"Just Cause" for Withdrawal of Recognition (Article II(3)):** This clause is potentially contentious as the definition of what constitutes an interruption or disruption to the orderly and effective operation of the bases is subjective. The clause also doesn't explicitly define the "final action" of the Joint Committee.
*   **"Military Requirements" (Agreed Minute 5):** This can be used as a broad excuse to separate employees without a clear legal definition.

**Recommendations:**

*   Carefully scrutinize any claims of "special management needs" to ensure they are legitimate and not discriminatory.
*   Clarify the definition of "final action" of the Joint Committee.
*   Monitor contractor compliance with Philippine labor laws.
*   Seek clarification or amendment of ambiguous clauses through diplomatic channels to avoid future disputes.
*   Prepare contingency plans in case of termination/amendment of Military Bases Agreement.
