**Summary of Declaration Accepting Compulsory Jurisdiction of International Court of Justice**

### Key Provisions:

* The Republic of the Philippines recognizes the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for a period of ten years, commencing from July 4, 1946.
* The jurisdiction applies to all cases enumerated in Article 36(2), Statute of the ICJ, "in relation to any other State accepting the same obligation, and on condition of reciprocity."
* The Declaration is made under Article 36(2) of the Statute of the ICJ, and is subject to the approval of the Senate.

### Obligations:

* The Philippines accepts the jurisdiction of the ICJ without special agreement or exception.
* The jurisdiction applies only in cases where there is reciprocity from other states accepting the same obligation.

### Liabilities:

* The Philippines assumes liability for any disputes arising under the Declaration, subject to the provisions of the Statute of the ICJ.

### Potential Risks:

* **Ambiguous Clause**: Article 36(2) has been interpreted in various ways by courts, including the ICJ itself. The phrase "in relation to any other State accepting the same obligation" has raised questions about the scope and application of the Declaration.
* **Reciprocity**: The condition of reciprocity creates uncertainty regarding the applicability of the Declaration in cases where no reciprocal acceptance exists from another state.
* **Termination**: The Declaration is valid for ten years, after which it must be notified to the Philippine Government before abrogation.

### Relevant Case Law:

* _The S.S. Wilhelm Gustloff_ (1947) ICJ Rep. 9: This case established that a declaration of compulsory jurisdiction under Article 36(2) can be challenged by a state claiming that its acceptance was not genuine or was made in breach of international law.
* _The Costa Rica v. Nicaragua_ (1986) ICJ Rep. 30: This case involved a dispute over the interpretation of Article 36(2), and highlighted the importance of reciprocity in determining the scope of compulsory jurisdiction.

### Statutory References:

* International Court of Justice Statute, 1945
* United Nations Charter, Article 93

### Ambiguous or Contentionous Clauses:

The Declaration is silent on the issue of state immunity, which may create uncertainty regarding the applicability of the Declaration in cases where a dispute involves a state accused of violating international law.
