## Legal Summary of the 1968 Trade Agreement Between New Zealand and the Philippines

**Document:** Trade Agreement Between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, July 19, 1968 (signed in Manila).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I (Most Favoured Nation Treatment - MFN):** Grants unconditional MFN status to both countries regarding customs duties, charges, rules, formalities, internal taxes, and regulations affecting import/export and internal sale/use of products.
*   **Article II (Prohibitions & Restrictions):** Prohibits discriminatory import/export restrictions and mandates equivalent treatment in foreign exchange allocation for trade transactions. Restrictions on imports/exports require like treatment to *all* third countries.
*   **Article III (Exceptions to MFN):** Carves out exceptions for (a) Philippine preferences for the US, (b) New Zealand preferences for Commonwealth countries and Western Samoa, (c) preferences consistent with GATT (now WTO) or UN agreements, (d) multilateral commodity agreements, and (e) balance of payments safeguards.
*   **Article IV (National Security & Public Health):** Preserves the right of each government to impose restrictions for essential security interests, public health, and prevention of diseases in animals or plants.
*   **Article V (Convertible Currency):** Mandates payments for trade between the two countries to be effected in convertible currency.
*   **Article VI (Consular Charges):** Limits consular charges to the approximate cost of services rendered, as a flat charge not based on goods value.
*   **Article VII (Consultation):** Provides for consultations upon request regarding the Agreement's operation, application, or amendment, or trade between the countries.
*   **Article VIII (Duration & Termination):** The agreement was initially for 1 year, automatically renewing until a 6-month written termination notice is given.
*   **Agreed Minutes:** clarifies the non-discriminatory treatment of state enterprises and encourages trade consultation.

**Obligations:**

*   Both governments must accord unconditional MFN treatment (Article I).
*   Both governments must administer import/export restrictions and foreign exchange allocations in a non-discriminatory manner (Article II).
*   State enterprises must act consistently with non-discriminatory treatment (Agreed Minutes).

**Liabilities:**

*   Breach of MFN obligations could lead to claims for compensatory adjustments or retaliation allowed under international trade law.
*   Failure to provide non-discriminatory treatment in state enterprise activities could result in diplomatic pressure and potential dispute resolution under Article VII.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Outdated Language:** The agreement uses language consistent with the GATT era. A modern trade agreement would likely include more detailed dispute resolution mechanisms, intellectual property protections, and investment provisions.
*   **Scope of Exceptions:** The exceptions listed in Article III may need to be reviewed in light of current WTO commitments and other international agreements. The breadth of the "balance of payments" exception in Article III(e) is particularly susceptible to abuse, as illustrated by the *Argentina - Financial Measures* dispute at the WTO.
*   **Lack of Enforcement Mechanism:** The agreement lacks a clear enforcement mechanism beyond consultation (Article VII).
*   **Ambiguity:** The meaning of "essential security interests" (Article IV(a)) could be contentious and may require interpretation in accordance with prevailing international legal standards.
*   **State Enterprises:** While the Agreed Minutes address state enterprises, the provisions are relatively weak and lack specific enforcement.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)/World Trade Organization (WTO) Law:** The exceptions under Article III(c) refer to GATT. Any interpretation of these provisions must be consistent with evolving WTO jurisprudence, including the MFN obligation under GATT Article I and the General Exceptions under Article XX.
*   **Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT):** The interpretation of this agreement will be governed by the VCLT, particularly Articles 31-33 regarding treaty interpretation.
*   Relevant Philippine and New Zealand domestic laws relating to tariffs, customs, import/export controls, and foreign exchange restrictions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Article III(e) (Balance of Payments):** The scope of measures "necessary" to safeguard the balance of payments is susceptible to broad interpretation and potential abuse. WTO jurisprudence provides guidance on permissible measures under this exception.
*   **Article IV(a) (Essential Security Interests):** The definition of "essential security interests" is inherently subjective and can be used as a pretext for protectionist measures.

**Recommendations:**

*   Assess the Agreement's compatibility with both countries' current WTO obligations and other international agreements.
*   Clarify the meaning and scope of the ambiguous provisions, particularly Article III(e) and Article IV(a), through consultations or, if necessary, amendment.
*   Consider negotiating a modern trade agreement to address deficiencies and include provisions on investment, intellectual property, and effective dispute resolution.
*   Review the operation of state enterprises in both countries to ensure compliance with non-discrimination principles.
