## Legal Summary: RP-Mongolia Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation (2000)

**Nature:** Bilateral Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines (RP) and Mongolia on Scientific and Technological Cooperation.

**Effective Date:** October 31, 2001.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I (Scope of Cooperation):**  Broadly defines areas of cooperation in S&T as mutually agreed upon, including but not limited to natural products research, biotechnology, health, natural resources, environment, disaster management, and human resources. Based on principles of equal rights and mutual advantage.
*   **Article II (Modes of Cooperation):** Lists various mechanisms for cooperation, including joint R&D, technical studies, training courses, conferences, expert exchanges, scholarships, information exchange, technology transfer, and promotion of technology exchanges between private enterprises. This is *not an exclusive* list.
*   **Article III (Exchanges, Scholarships, and Fellowships):** Outlines procedures for candidate selection, cost allocation (sending party covers international travel unless otherwise agreed; host party covers accommodation and local transport), adherence to host country laws, and provision of necessary facilities and assistance.
*   **Article IV (Intellectual Property):** Addresses intellectual property rights (IPR) arising from projects. *Crucially*, it mandates that IPR matters be *determined and agreed upon* *prior* to project implementation. Also includes a non-disclosure provision of special scientific and technological knowledge to third parties without written approval.
*   **Article V (Amendments):**  Allows for amendments via written request through diplomatic channels and mutual consent.
*   **Article VII (Dispute Settlement):**  Requires amicable dispute resolution via consultation or negotiation, excluding reference to third parties or international tribunals.
*   **Article VIII (Implementing Agencies):** Provides for the establishment of a joint commission or consultative body to oversee implementation.
*   **Article IX (Validity and Entry into Force):**  Valid for five years, automatically renewable unless terminated with six months' notice. Ongoing projects at expiration must be completed per specific project arrangements.

**Obligations:**

*   Both parties are obligated to promote and develop S&T cooperation in mutually agreed areas (Article I).
*   Parties must select candidates for exchanges per specifications of the other party (Article III).
*   The Host Party is responsible for covering the candidate's accommodation and transportation expenses within its territory (Article III).
*   Candidates exchanged under the Agreement shall observe the laws, rules and regulations of the host Party (Article III).
*   Parties must reach agreement on IPR matters *before* implementing projects (Article IV).
*   Parties must protect the confidentiality of special scientific and technological knowledge acquired during the implementation of the Agreement (Article IV).
*   Parties are obliged to consult each other regarding any matters relating to the Agreement's implementation upon explicit request (Article VI).
*   Parties must engage in good faith negotiations/consultations to resolve disputes (Article VII).

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **IPR Disputes (Article IV):**  The agreement mandates *prior* agreement on IPR, but failure to reach such agreement *prior* could lead to disputes later, hindering project success and potentially resulting in litigation. The vague term "special scientific and technological knowledge" could be a source of contention, as its scope is undefined. The non-disclosure obligation lacks clarity regarding duration and specific remedies for breach. Consider defining the precise scope of "special scientific and technological knowledge" and including mechanisms for enforcing the non-disclosure agreement.
*   **Ambiguity in Scope (Article I):**  The broad and non-exclusive language defining the areas of cooperation could lead to disagreements over which activities fall within the scope of the agreement.
*   **Funding Shortfalls (Article III):** Reliance on the host party's rules and regulations for accommodation and transportation expenses could lead to funding shortfalls or inadequate support for exchange participants.
*   **Dispute Resolution Limitations (Article VII):**  The exclusive reliance on consultation/negotiation for dispute resolution may be insufficient if the parties are unable to reach a consensus, potentially leading to impasse. No provision for arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
*   **Lack of Enforcement Mechanisms:** The Agreement lacks specific enforcement mechanisms for breaches of its provisions, which could limit its effectiveness.
*   **Liability for Actions of Exchange Participants:**  While Article III requires participants to follow the host country's laws, the agreement lacks provisions addressing potential liability for damages caused by participants.

**Statutory References/Case Law:**

*   Philippine law on treaties and international agreements (e.g., Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties) would govern the interpretation and implementation of this agreement.
*   Philippine Intellectual Property Code (Republic Act No. 8293, as amended) is relevant to Article IV, although the agreement places emphasis on *prior* specific agreements regarding IPR rather than relying solely on domestic laws.
*   Mongolian equivalent laws on treaties, intellectual property, and related areas would also be pertinent.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The breadth of Article I.
*   Article IV's reliance on *prior* agreement on IPR.
*   The limited dispute resolution mechanism in Article VII.
*   The lack of specific enforcement mechanisms throughout.

**Recommendations:**

*   When implementing specific projects, prioritize negotiating and executing detailed agreements addressing IPR ownership, licensing, and confidentiality.
*   Clarify the definition of "special scientific and technological knowledge" in subsequent implementing agreements.
*   Consider adding an arbitration clause to Article VII in future revisions.
*   Develop internal guidelines and procedures to ensure compliance with the agreement's provisions, including those related to funding and support for exchange participants.
