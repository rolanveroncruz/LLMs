This is a sample of the Agreement between the United States and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, which was signed on July 27, 1955. The agreement covers various aspects of cooperation, including:

1. **Restricted Data**: The agreement prohibits the transfer of Restricted Data (nuclear secrets) to the government of the Philippines or its authorized persons.
2. **Safeguards**: The agreement requires the government of the Philippines to maintain safeguards to ensure that nuclear materials and equipment are used only for peaceful purposes, such as research reactors.
3. **Fuel Delivery**: At the end of the agreement, the government of the Philippines must deliver all fuel elements containing reactor fuels leased by the United States Commission to the Commission in the United States.
4. **Research Reactors**: The agreement defines what constitutes a research reactor and requires the government of the Philippines to maintain records on power levels and burn-up of reactor fuels.

This agreement marked the beginning of cooperation between the United States and the Philippines in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and it has been renewed several times since its initial signing.
