This is a large excerpt from the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic, which established international standards for road safety and regulations for vehicles. The annexes of the convention provide specific details on various aspects such as dimensions and weights of vehicles, driving permits, and conditions to be fulfilled by drivers.

Here's a summary of each annex:

**Annex 7: Dimensions and Weights**

* Specifies maximum permissible dimensions and weights for vehicles, including over-all width, height, length, and weight per axle.
* Allows Contracting States to increase these limits through regional agreements.
* Provides guidelines for roads with special conditions that may restrict vehicle passage.

**Annex 8: Conditions to be Fulfilled by Drivers**

* Sets the minimum age for driving a motor vehicle in international traffic at 18 years.
* Allows other countries to recognize lower age permits for drivers of motorcycles and invalid carriages.

**Annex 9: Model Driving Permit Dimensions**

* Specifies the dimensions (length x width) of a model driving permit.

**Annex 10: Model International Driving Permit Dimensions**

* Specifies the dimensions (length x width) of a model international driving permit.

**Protocol Concerning Countries or Territories at Present Occupied**

* Provides an exception to Chapter VII of the Convention, allowing the Economic and Social Council to address invitations to countries or territories currently occupied to accede to the Convention.

This convention is still in force today, with many countries having adopted its provisions as part of their national road traffic regulations.
