*   Parties are required to maintain confidentiality of information exchanged (Article 11).
*   Parties should facilitate cooperation (Article 4).

**Liabilities and Risks:**

*   **Sovereignty Concerns (Article 10):** Broad exception allows refusal of assistance based on sovereignty or national interest, creating potential for disputes over interpretation.
*   **Confidentiality Breaches (Article 11):** Potential for unauthorized disclosure of information, despite confidentiality provisions. The exceptions for drug-related offenses and public health/security/environment could be broadly construed.
*   **Interpretation of "Domestic Law" (Various Articles):** The agreement repeatedly states that assistance will be provided in accordance with the domestic law of the requested party. This could lead to inconsistencies in the application of the agreement, as domestic laws differ.
*   **Ambiguity in "Reasonable Time" (Article 6):** The requirement that the requested Customs Authority takes all reasonable measures to execute a request within a reasonable amount of time opens the door for interpretation.
*   **Enforcement Challenges:** The agreement itself does not provide enforcement mechanisms. Disputes would likely need to be resolved through diplomatic channels or potentially international arbitration, depending on interpretation of international law principles applicable to treaties.

**Potential Contentious Clauses:**

*   Article 10 regarding exemptions from assistance.
*   Article 11 concerning confidentiality.
*   The phrase "reasonable amount of time" in Article 6.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   While the agreement doesn't explicitly reference specific statutes, its interpretation and application would be governed by the domestic customs laws of both the Philippines and Israel. Philippine law would include the *Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines* (RA 10863, also known as the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act or CMTA) and related regulations.
*   Principles of *pacta sunt servanda* (agreements must be kept) and good faith interpretation of treaties under international law would apply. Case law from the International Court of Justice and other international tribunals would be relevant in interpreting the agreement's provisions.
