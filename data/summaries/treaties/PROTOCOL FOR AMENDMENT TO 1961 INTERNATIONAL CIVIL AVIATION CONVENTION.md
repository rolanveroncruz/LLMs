**International Civil Aviation Protocol for Amendment**

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Amendments to Article 50(a)**: The expression "twenty-one" is deleted and replaced with "twenty-seven", increasing the membership of the Council from twenty-one to twenty-seven.
2. **Ratification Requirements**: The protocol comes into force upon deposit of the fifty-sixth instrument of ratification, which corresponds to the number of Contracting States required for implementation (Article 94(a) of the Convention).
3. **Deposited Instruments**: Instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the International Civil Aviation Organization.
4. **Force of Ratification**: The protocol comes into force upon deposit of an instrument of ratification, unless it is a Contracting State that ratifies after the specified date, in which case it comes into force upon deposit.

**Obligations:**

* States parties or signatories to the Convention on International Civil Aviation must ratify this Protocol.
* Contracting States must deposit their instruments of ratification with the International Civil Aviation Organization.

**Liabilities:**

* States that fail to ratify or adhere to the Convention may be subject to international scrutiny and potential diplomatic repercussions.
* Contracting States that delay or refuse to ratify the protocol may face economic or reputational consequences, as they will not benefit from the increased Council membership.

**Potential Risks:**

* **Uncertainty**: The Protocol's implementation is contingent upon the deposit of the fifty-sixth instrument of ratification. If this condition is not met, the Protocol may remain unenforced.
* **Diplomatic Fallout**: Delayed or refused ratification by Contracting States could lead to diplomatic tensions with other states parties or signatories to the Convention.

**Relevant Case Law:**

* No specific case law directly addresses this protocol. However, decisions related to international agreements and treaties may provide guidance on issues such as ratification, implementation, and state obligations.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

* The provision requiring the deposit of instruments of ratification with the International Civil Aviation Organization may be subject to interpretation. It is unclear whether this requirement applies to all Contracting States or only those that have ratified or adhered to the Convention.
* The condition for implementation, i.e., the deposit of the fifty-sixth instrument of ratification, creates a risk of uncertainty and potential diplomatic repercussions if not met.

**Certified Copies:**

* Certified copies of the Protocol shall be transmitted by the Secretary General of the Organization to all States parties or signatories to the Convention on International Civil Aviation done at Chicago on the seventh day of December, 1944.
