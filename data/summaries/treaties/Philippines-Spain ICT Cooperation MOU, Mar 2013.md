## Summary of DOST-ICTO & Spanish State Secretariat MOU on ICT Cooperation

This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Department of Science and Technology-Information and Communications Technology Office (DOST-ICTO) of the Philippines and the State Secretariat for Telecommunications and Information Society of Spain (Spanish State Secretariat), signed March 18, 2013, establishes a framework for cooperation in the field of Information and Communications Technology (ICT).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Purpose (Article I):** To encourage and strengthen cooperation and development in ICT based on equality, reciprocity, and mutual benefit.
*   **Scope of Cooperation (Article II):** Identifies broad areas of common interest including ICT policies and regulations (spectrum management), technical standards and certifications, e-commerce/e-government, cybersecurity (including child protection), capacity building, e-health/e-education, green ICT, disaster risk reduction, bridging the digital divide, and linkages between ICT institutions.
*   **Cooperative Activities (Article III):** Defines permissible cooperative activities, including joint projects, exchange of experts, technical exhibitions, seminars, and other mutually agreed forms of collaboration.
*   **ICT Cooperative Committee (Article IV):** Establishes a committee to coordinate activities, determine direction of cooperation, and ensure effectiveness of cooperation and exchange activities. Composition and deliverables to be agreed upon before each meeting.
*   **Legal Framework and Funding (Article V):** Emphasizes that activities must comply with applicable laws and regulations of each country and respect Intellectual Property Rights as established by international bodies (WTO-TRIPS). Crucially, it specifies that commitments "do not produce obligations in the scope of the International Law, and are not legally binding." Expenses are subject to annual budget availability.
*   **Release of Information (Article VI):** Prohibits disclosure of confidential information to third parties without written authorization.
*   **Amendments (Article VII):** Allows for amendments by mutual written consent.
*   **Dispute Settlement (Article VIII):** Mandates amicable settlement of disputes through consultations.
*   **Validity (Article IX):** Effective for five (5) years, with six (6) months' written notice for termination. Termination doesn't affect ongoing cooperative activities.

**Obligations:**

*   Both parties are obligated to foster cooperation in the identified areas.
*   Establish and participate in the ICT Cooperative Committee.
*   Respect intellectual property rights.
*   Maintain confidentiality of information exchanged.
*   Act within the bounds of their respective national laws and regulations.

**Liabilities:**

*   The MOU explicitly states that the commitments assumed are "not legally binding," significantly limiting any potential legal liability.
*   Expenses are subject to budget availability, further reducing financial liability.
*   Liability for breach of confidentiality, although likely unenforceable due to the non-binding nature of the MOU, could arise if confidential information is disclosed without authorization.
*   The agreement lacks enforcement mechanisms for violations.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Enforceability:** The most significant risk is the non-binding nature of the MOU. This means that neither party can legally compel the other to fulfill any of the outlined cooperative activities.
*   **Funding Uncertainty:** The reliance on annual budget availability creates uncertainty regarding the feasibility and scope of planned projects.
*   **Intellectual Property Disputes:** Although the MOU mentions respect for IPRs (referencing WTO-TRIPS), disputes could arise if the application of these rights to specific cooperative activities is unclear.
*   **Confidentiality Breaches:** While there is a confidentiality clause, its enforceability is questionable given the MOU's overall non-binding nature.
*   **Political and Economic Changes:** Changes in government or economic conditions in either country could affect the priorities and commitment to ICT cooperation, potentially rendering the MOU ineffective.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The reference to WTO-TRIPS is relevant for interpreting the scope of Intellectual Property Rights obligations.
*   Philippine law on international agreements, particularly *Executive Order No. 459*, is applicable for the legal status and treatment of this MOU as an executive agreement.
*   *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties* (if invoked) regarding the interpretation of international agreements, though this may be irrelevant given the MOU's non-binding nature.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Not legally binding":** This clause is the most contentious, severely limiting the legal effect of the entire document. It essentially transforms the MOU into a statement of intent rather than a legally enforceable agreement.
*   **"Annual budget availability":** Creates uncertainty regarding the actual implementation of cooperative activities.

**Overall Assessment:**

This MOU is essentially a non-binding statement of intent. While it provides a framework for cooperation and identifies areas of mutual interest, its lack of legal enforceability significantly reduces its practical value. Any significant investment or commitment based on this MOU should be carefully considered, given the absence of legal recourse in case of non-performance. Careful monitoring of budget allocations and political developments is recommended. This agreement is more of a diplomatic tool rather than a binding contract.
