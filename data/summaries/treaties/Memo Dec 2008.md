The text appears to be a copy of the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up, adopted by the General Conference of the International Labour Organization in 1998. The document outlines the procedures for reviewing and following up on fundamental principles and rights at work, which are essential for promoting social justice and human dignity.

The text is divided into several sections:

I. Purpose and Scope
This section sets out the purpose and scope of the follow-up process, which includes reviewing efforts made by members to implement fundamental principles and rights at work, particularly those who have not ratified all the fundamental conventions.

II. Annual Follow-Up concerning Non-Ratified Fundamental Conventions
This section outlines the procedures for conducting an annual review of non-ratified fundamental conventions, including requesting reports from member states, reviewing these reports, and examining adjustments to the governing body's existing procedures to facilitate participation by non-represented members.

III. Global Report
This section explains the purpose and scope of the global report, which aims to provide a dynamic picture of progress on fundamental principles and rights at work, assess the effectiveness of assistance provided by the organization, and determine priorities for technical cooperation in the following period.

IV. It is Understood That...
This final section states that proposals will be made for amendments to the standing orders of the governing body and the conference to implement the preceding provisions, and that the conference will review the operation of this follow-up process in due course.
