This is a sample of the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) between the Republic of the Philippines and the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union. The treaty governs investment relations between the two parties and provides for dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration.

Here are some key points about this treaty:

1. **Investment scope**: The treaty applies to investments made by investors of one party in the territory of the other party, subject to the laws and regulations of that country.
2. **Dispute resolution**: Disputes arising from the interpretation or application of the treaty can be settled through diplomatic channels, a joint commission, or arbitration.
3. **Arbitration**: The arbitration process involves two arbitrators appointed by each party within a certain timeframe. If the parties fail to appoint an arbitrator, the President of the International Court of Justice or the Vice-President may make the appointment.
4. **Costs**: Each party bears the costs of its own arbitrator, while the expenses for the third arbitrator and administrative costs are shared equally between the two parties.
5. **Duration**: The treaty enters into force one month after exchange of ratification instruments and remains in effect for a period of 10 years, with the option to terminate or extend it by notice given at least one year before expiry.

This treaty provides a framework for investment protection and dispute resolution between the Philippines and the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union.
