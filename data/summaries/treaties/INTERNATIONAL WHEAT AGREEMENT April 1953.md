This text is a reproduction of the Agricultural Agreement (also known as the Wheat Agreement or the Paris Convention on International Trade in Milk and Dairy Products) signed on April 13, 1953. The agreement established rules for international trade in milk and dairy products, including wheat, and its provisions are still relevant today.

The agreement was signed by 25 countries, including major dairy-producing countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as major importers of dairy products like France, Germany, and Italy. The agreement aimed to promote free trade in milk and dairy products, reduce tariffs and quotas, and increase cooperation among member countries.

The text you provided includes the full text of the agreement, which consists of 24 articles, including provisions on:

1. Article XXII: Duration, amendment, withdrawal, and termination
2. Article XXIII: Territorial application

These two articles outline the procedures for amending, withdrawing from, or terminating the agreement.

Here are some key points to note about this agreement:

* The agreement was signed in 1953, but it did not come into effect until July 31, 1956.
* The agreement established a system of quotas and tariffs that were intended to promote free trade in milk and dairy products.
* The agreement also provided for cooperation among member countries on issues like sanitary and phytosanitary measures, veterinary services, and market access.
* The agreement was initially signed by 25 countries, but it has been modified and updated over time through amendments and accession agreements.

Today, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other international organizations continue to promote free trade and cooperation in agriculture, including dairy products. However, the specifics of agricultural trade agreements have evolved significantly since the Paris Convention on International Trade in Milk and Dairy Products was signed in 1953.
