This is a sample of an international investment agreement between the Philippines and the Netherlands, as reflected in Article 8 of the Investment Agreement between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The article outlines the provisions for dispute resolution, including conciliation and arbitration.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Dispute Resolution**: The Contracting Parties agree to consult each other on any matter relating to investments between the two countries or otherwise affecting the implementation of the Agreement.
2. **Conciliation**: If a dispute arises, either Party may request the Center established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States to submit the dispute for conciliation.
3. **Arbitration**: The Contracting Parties agree to submit any dispute that cannot be resolved through conciliation to a panel of arbitrators for decision.
4. **Composition of the Panel**: The panel shall consist of three members, one selected by each Party within one month of receipt of the request for arbitration, and the third chosen by the members thus selected by the Parties within two months from the designation of the second member.
5. **Arbitral Proceedings**: The panel shall determine its own procedure, reach its decision by a majority of votes, and be binding on both Contracting Parties.
6. **Costs**: Each Party shall bear the cost of its own member of the panel and representation in the arbitral proceedings.

This agreement is likely intended to provide a framework for resolving disputes that may arise between the two countries related to investments made under the Agreement.
