### Key Provisions

1. **Objectives**: The MOU outlines the objectives of cooperation, including the promotion of joint programs in high-performance training, international competitions, and sport education.
2. **Areas of Cooperation**: The MOU specifies seven areas for cooperation:

3. **Intellectual Property**: Each party agrees to respect the intellectual property rights of the other within their respective territories.
4. **Financial Arrangements**: The MOU establishes that costs for cooperation activities will be borne by the participating parties based on mutually agreed terms and availability of funds.

### Liability and Risk Assessment

2. **Risk of Non-Compliance**: Failure to comply with intellectual property protection obligations could lead to disputes or reputational damage.

### Case Law References

### Potential Risks and Obligations

1. **Diplomatic Fallout**: Failure to comply with provisions or disputes arising from the MOU could lead to diplomatic tensions between the two countries.
