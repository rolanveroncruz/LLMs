I can help you summarize this article. However, I need to clarify that this article appears to be a draft of an international treaty related to cultural heritage and education, specifically the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.

If you'd like, I can help summarize the main points of the article, which includes:

1. Article 19: Signatures, ratifications, and accessions to the convention.
2. Article 20: Entry into force of the convention.
3. Article 21: Denunciations of the convention.
4. Article 22: Amendments to the convention.
5. Article 23: Notifications regarding extensions of the convention to territories.
6. Article 24: Prohibition on reservations to the convention.
7. Article 25: Notification of certain actions related to the convention.
8. Article 26: Registration with the United Nations.

Please let me know if you'd like a more detailed summary or if there's anything else I can help you with!
