**Liabilities:**

*   The Philippines bears all risks arising from operations under the MOU, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct of Australian actors. This raises potential questions of *respondeat superior* and the standard of proof for establishing gross negligence or willful misconduct.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Sovereign Immunity:** While not explicitly waived, the claims provision suggests a potential impact on sovereign immunity, particularly concerning third-party claims. The limitation of liability (gross negligence/willful misconduct) requires careful scrutiny.
*   **Funding:** Australian disbursement subject to parliamentary approval introduces a risk of delayed or reduced funding.
*   **Interpretation of "Gross Negligence/Willful Misconduct":** This phrase is ambiguous and could lead to disputes regarding liability for operational failures. Case law regarding the interpretation of these terms in the Philippines and Australia would be relevant.
*   **Administrative & Financial Regulations (2.8):** The existing Phillipines regulations on Filipino personnel may present a challenge for Australian personnel management.
*   **Coordination and Integration:** Coordination among various agencies of the Philippine government and integration of the NSIRDP with existing programs could be challenging, potentially leading to delays and inefficiencies. The success hinges on the effective functioning of the described committee structure (Annex 2).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Review Philippine law on sovereign immunity, torts, and indemnity agreements.
*   Investigate case law in both countries defining "gross negligence" and "willful misconduct."
*   Relevant Philippine administrative and financial regulations (mentioned in Section 2.8) governing personnel issues and potentially project implementation.
*   Australian legislation governing foreign aid and development assistance, particularly relating to disbursement and accountability.
