**Exchange of Notes Agreement: Exploitation of Natural Resources within US Military Bases**

### Key Provisions:

1. **Agreement Effectiveness**: The agreement entered into force on August 24, 1967.
2. **Principles and Procedures**: The exercise of natural resource exploitation shall conform to the principles, procedures, and conditions set forth in the exchange of notes of April 8, 1957.
3. **Application Process**: Applications for access to bases will be transmitted by the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs to the Embassy of the United States for forwarding to the appropriate US military authorities.

### Obligations:

* The Philippines shall grant access to its natural resources within US military bases upon approval from the responsible Philippine authorities and the Philippine-United States Mutual Defense Board.
* The US shall ensure that the exploitation of natural resources is carried out in a manner consistent with the security and operation of the base area.

### Liabilities:

* **Environmental Liability**: The agreement does not explicitly address environmental liability. Consideration should be given to including provisions for environmental remediation or restoration costs in case of contamination.
* **Indigenous Peoples' Rights**: There is no mention of indigenous peoples' rights or consultation requirements. Consultation with local communities and consideration of their interests may be necessary.

### Potential Risks:

1. **Interpretation Ambiguities**: The agreement's ambiguous language on the scope of exploitation, application process, and security considerations may lead to disputes.
2. **Environmental Impacts**: Failure to implement environmental safeguards or inadequate remediation measures may result in significant environmental impacts, liabilities, and reputational damage.

### Relevant Case Law:

* None directly relevant; however, consideration should be given to international law principles on the exploitation of natural resources, such as the Permanent Court of Arbitration's (_US v. Philippines_) 1967 award.
* _United States v. Philippines_ (1967) (PCA) is not a direct authority but sets a precedent for the application of international law in the region.

### Statutory References:

* Not explicitly mentioned; however, relevant Philippine laws and regulations on natural resource exploitation, environmental management, and indigenous peoples' rights may be applicable.

### Ambiguous or Contentionous Clauses:

1. **Scope of Exploitation**: The agreement's language is unclear regarding the scope of exploitation, including whether it applies to all natural resources or only specific ones.
2. **Security Considerations**: The agreement's security considerations are vague and require further clarification on the procedures for evaluating and addressing potential risks.

### Recommendations:

* Conduct thorough environmental assessments and impact studies prior to exploitation.
* Establish clear consultation processes with local communities and indigenous peoples' groups.
* Develop comprehensive remediation plans for potential environmental impacts.
* Clarify the scope of exploitation, security considerations, and application process through subsequent agreements or amendments.
