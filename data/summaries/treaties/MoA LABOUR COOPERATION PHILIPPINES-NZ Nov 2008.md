This is a draft of the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Declaration of Philadelphia, which was adopted in 1990. The Declaration sets forth the fundamental principles and rights that are essential for promoting social justice and human dignity at work.

The Declaration has four main objectives:

1. To promote freedom of association and collective bargaining
2. To eliminate all forms of forced or compulsory labor
3. To abolish child labor
4. To eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation

The Declaration also recognizes the obligation of the ILO to assist its members in their efforts to implement these principles and rights.

The follow-up to the Declaration involves two main aspects:

1. An annual review of non-ratified fundamental Conventions, which will be based on reports requested from member states.
2. A global report that will provide a dynamic picture of the progress made by member states in implementing the Declaration's objectives.

The document emphasizes that labor standards should not be used for protectionist trade purposes and that nothing in the Declaration or its follow-up should be invoked for such purposes.

Overall, the Declaration and its follow-up aim to promote social justice and human dignity at work by promoting fundamental principles and rights that are essential for workers' well-being.
