**Memorandum of Understanding on Social Security - Philippines and France (July 12, 1989)**

**Summary:** This is a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of France, signed July 12, 1989, expressing the *intent* of both governments to negotiate a formal Agreement on Social Security.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Purpose:** To ensure the protection of the social rights of workers from both countries.
*   **Agreement to Negotiate:** Both governments agree to open negotiations on a Social Security Agreement "as soon as possible."
*   **Location of Negotiations:** Negotiations may take place in Paris or Manila.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **No binding obligations are created by this MOU.** It merely expresses an intention to negotiate in good faith. Failure to reach a final agreement would not constitute a breach.
*   **Absence of Enforcement Mechanism:** The MOU contains no enforcement mechanism or remedies for failure to initiate or complete negotiations.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Vagueness of "as soon as possible":** This phrase lacks specific timelines, making it potentially ambiguous.
*   **Lack of Detail:** The MOU lacks any specifics regarding the scope, content, or terms of the proposed Social Security Agreement. No detail regarding qualifying conditions of a worker, only that an agreement to protect workers should be drawn.
*   **Non-Binding Nature:** The MOU explicitly expresses intent and does not constitute a contract. Legal action predicated solely on this document would likely fail.
*   **Superseding Legislation/Treaties:** Any future legislation or conflicting treaty obligations by either country could potentially impact the negotiating position or ultimate enforceability of a subsequent Social Security Agreement, *if* one is reached.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **General Principles of Treaty Law:** Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) addresses interpretation of treaties, but this MOU is not a treaty and would only be relevant in interpreting an actual Social Security Agreement.
*   **Philippine Law on Treaties and Executive Agreements:** Refer to Philippine jurisprudence and relevant executive orders regarding the process and legal effect of treaties and international agreements.  Cite relevant cases concerning the distinction between treaties requiring Senate ratification and executive agreements.
*   **French Law on Treaties and International Agreements:** Likewise, research French law and related court cases on the same matter.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "as soon as possible" could be interpreted differently by each party, potentially leading to delays or disputes.
* The MOU lacks clarity on the specific beneficiaries, terms, and conditions of a future social security agreement.
**Disclaimer:** This is a preliminary summary for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. A thorough review of relevant national laws, international conventions, and subsequent related actions is necessary for a comprehensive legal analysis.
