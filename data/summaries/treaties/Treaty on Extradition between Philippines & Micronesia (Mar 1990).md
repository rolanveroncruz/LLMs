This is a treaty between the Philippines and the Federated States of Micronesia, concerning extradition. The treaty outlines the terms and conditions under which one country may request another to extradite an individual for trial or punishment in connection with a crime committed in that country.

The key points of the treaty include:

1. **Extradition for offenses committed before surrender**: A person extradited under this treaty shall not be detained or tried, or subject to any other restriction of personal liberty, for any offense committed before surrender unless it is an offense for which extradition was granted.
2. **Request for consent**: The Requesting State must request the consent of the Requested State for extradition to a Third State.
3. **Transit arrangements**: Permission for transit through one Contracting State's territory shall be subject to the laws of that country, including permission to hold the person in custody during transit.
4. **Representation and expenses**: The Requested State must make necessary arrangements for proceedings arising out of an extradition request and represent the interest of the Requesting State.
5. **Obligations under other conventions**: This treaty does not affect any obligations that Contracting States may have undertaken or may undertake under multilateral conventions to which they are both parties.

The treaty also establishes procedures for terminating it, including a notice period of 108 days before termination takes effect.

This treaty highlights the importance of cooperation between countries in cases where an individual is accused of committing a crime in another country. By establishing clear guidelines and procedures for extradition, these countries can work together to ensure that justice is served while also respecting the rights of individuals involved.
