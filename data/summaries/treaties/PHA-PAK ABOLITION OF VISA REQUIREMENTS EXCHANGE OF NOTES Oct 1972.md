**Summary of Agreement on Abolition of Non-Immigrant Visa Requirements**

### Key Provisions:

* Citizens of Pakistan and the Philippines holding valid passports shall be allowed to enter each other's territories as tourists or for business purposes without a visa for up to 59 days.
* The waiver of visa requirements does not exempt individuals from complying with host country laws and regulations regarding employment or profession.

### Obligations:

* Each party reserves the right to refuse entry or stay in its territory if the individual is considered undesirable.
* Parties may temporarily suspend the agreement due to public order concerns, provided that notification is given to the other party.
* Parties may denounce the agreement by written notice, with the denunciation taking effect three months after receipt.

### Liabilities:

* The Philippines and Pakistan are jointly and severally liable for any damages or claims arising from the implementation of this agreement.

### Potential Risks:

* **Unilateral Refusal**: One party's unilateral refusal to allow entry or stay of a citizen from the other country may be considered an act of state that requires international notification.
* **Ambiguity on Undesirable Citizens**: The ambiguous clause regarding undesirable citizens may lead to disputes between the parties, as there is no clear definition of who constitutes an "undesirable."
* **Public Order Suspension**: The temporary suspension provision may raise concerns about the ability of one party to unilaterally restrict travel rights based on public order considerations.
* **Denunciation and Withdrawal**: The three-month notice period for denouncing the agreement may lead to disputes over the timing and effectiveness of withdrawal.

### Relevance to Case Law:

* The Supreme Court's interpretation of this agreement may be influenced by the principles of international law, including the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Air Transport Agreement (1944).
* Any disputes arising from this agreement may be governed by the 1972 agreement itself or subsequent bilateral agreements.

### Statutory References:

* The 1972 agreement is published in XI DFA TS No. 1, p. 187.
* Relevant provisions of international law and bilateral agreements may be cited to support or challenge interpretations of specific clauses.

### Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:

* Clause 4: Reserves the right to refuse entry or stay for citizens considered undesirable. The definition of an "undesirable" citizen is unclear.
* Clause 5: Temporarily suspends the agreement due to public order concerns. The notification requirement may be subject to interpretation.

### Recommendations for Lawyers:

* Carefully review and analyze the agreement's provisions, particularly Clauses 4 and 5, which may raise contentious issues.
* Consult with international law experts and relevant authorities (e.g., ICAO) to interpret ambiguous clauses or understand applicable principles.
* Consider the potential implications of unilateral refusal or denunciation by one party.
