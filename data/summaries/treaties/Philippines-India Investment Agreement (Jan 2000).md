## Summary of the Philippines-India Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) (2000)

This is a summary of the 2000 BIT between the Philippines and India, focusing on key provisions, obligations, liabilities, and potential risks.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I (Definitions):** Broadly defines "Investment" to include movable and immovable property, shares, rights to money, intellectual property, and business concessions. Definition of "Companies" contains public order and essential security interest exception which requires mutual agreement between parties.
*   **Article II (Scope):** Applies retroactively to investments made *before* the agreement's entry into force, a common but potentially contentious feature.
*   **Article III (Promotion and Protection):** Encourages investments and mandates "fair and equitable treatment" of investments.
*   **Article IV (Treatment):** Grants national treatment and Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) treatment to investments, with exceptions for existing or future customs unions, free trade areas, regional economic organizations, or matters pertaining wholly or mainly to taxation.
*   **Article V (Expropriation):** Permits expropriation only for public purpose, in accordance with law, on a non-discriminatory basis, and accompanied by prompt, adequate, and effective compensation based on "genuine value" immediately before expropriation or when expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is earlier. Investors have the right to judicial review.
*   **Article VI (Compensation for Losses):** Provides for national or MFN treatment regarding restitution, indemnification, compensation, or other settlement for losses due to war, armed conflict, national emergency, or civil disturbances.
*   **Article VII (Transfers):** Guarantees free transfer of funds related to investments, including capital, profits, loan repayments, royalties, and proceeds from sales or liquidation. Transfers must occur without "unreasonable delay" at the prevailing market rate.
*   **Article VIII (Subrogation):** Addresses subrogation of rights by the insuring Contracting Party in cases of non-commercial risk guarantees.
*   **Article IX (Settlement of Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of Another Contracting Party):** Outlines a dispute resolution mechanism involving negotiations, domestic courts, ICSID arbitration (if both parties are signatories), UNCITRAL conciliation, or ad hoc arbitration under UNCITRAL Rules. The appointing authority for the ad hoc tribunal is the President, Vice President, or next senior Judge of the International Court of Justice, provided they are not nationals of either Contracting Party.
*   **Article X (Disputes Between the Contracting Parties):** Specifies that disputes regarding interpretation or application of this Agreement should be settled through negotiation. If this is not possible after six months, either Contracting Party may request that it be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.
*   **Article XIV (Entry into Force, Duration, and Termination):** The Agreement shall remain in force for a period of ten years, and then shall be deemed to have been automatically extended unless either Contracting Party gives the other Contracting Party a written notice of its intention to terminate the Agreement. The agreement shall stand terminated one year from the date of receipt of such written notice. The sunset clause extends protections for 15 years after termination for investments made before termination.

**Obligations:**

*   **Host State:** To promote and protect investments, provide fair and equitable treatment, national treatment, and MFN treatment, allow free transfers of funds, pay compensation for expropriation and losses due to conflict/emergency, and submit to dispute resolution.
*   **Investor:** To comply with the laws and regulations of the host state.

**Liabilities:**

*   Host state may be liable for breaches of treaty obligations, including unfair and inequitable treatment, discriminatory measures, illegal expropriation, or restrictions on fund transfers. This liability can result in monetary damages awarded by an arbitral tribunal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Fair and Equitable Treatment":** The lack of a precise definition of "fair and equitable treatment" (FET) can lead to disputes and varying interpretations by tribunals. Case law is varied with respect to interpreting FET standards.
*   **Valuation of Expropriated Assets:** Determining the "genuine value" of investments, particularly for concessions or complex assets, can be highly contentious and lead to lengthy valuation disputes. The language "whichever is earlier" adds a layer of complexity, requiring careful examination of information disclosure and its impact on valuation.
*   **Retroactive Application:** Article II's retroactive application could expose either state to claims related to past regulatory actions or policies.
*   **Definition of Investment:** The broad definition could encompass investments that the host state did not intend to cover, potentially expanding the scope of treaty protection and increasing liability.
*   **UNCITRAL Arbitration & Appointing Authority:** Reliance on the President of the ICJ as the appointing authority is cumbersome and might cause delays.
*   **Definition of "Territory":** Overlap and potential conflict between the Philippines and India's interpretation of what constitutes the "territory" of each country as defined in Article I(6) of the agreement.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The interpretation of "fair and equitable treatment" is highly fact-specific and has been addressed in numerous investment treaty arbitration cases (e.g., *Tecmed v. Mexico*).
*   The definition of expropriation and "measures tantamount to expropriation" is addressed in numerous cases.
*   The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976) and ICSID Convention provide the procedural framework for investor-state dispute settlement.
*   The Philippine Constitution (Article IV and Article I) is relevant for defining "nationals" and "territory," respectively.
*   The Indian law in force defining "nationals" (Article I(2)(b)) requires clarification.
*   The 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ("UNCLOS"), which is referred to in defining the territory of India.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Fair and Equitable Treatment"**: As noted above, this is a highly subjective standard.
*   **"Genuine Value"**: Definition is not explicitly defined.
*   **"Without Unreasonable Delay"**: Definition is not explicitly defined and thus will depend on case law.

**Legal Advice:**

This BIT provides significant protections to investors from both the Philippines and India. However, the ambiguous clauses create potential for disputes. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence, structure investments carefully to take advantage of treaty protections, and be prepared to engage in dispute resolution if necessary. The sunset clause provides long term protection, but also means the BIT remains effective, especially for investments made before the termination date. States may wish to reconsider remaining a party.
