This is a document from 1946, specifically Resolution A/45 adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on February 12, 1946. The resolution deals with the problem of refugees and displaced persons following World War II.

The document outlines several key points:

1. **International scope**: The problem of refugees and displaced persons is recognized as international in scope and nature.
2. **Principles for consideration**:
	* No refugee or displaced person who expresses no valid objections to returning to their country of origin and does not fall under paragraph (d) should be compelled to return.
	* The main task is to encourage and assist the early return of displaced persons to their countries of origin.
	* Action taken will not interfere with the surrender and punishment of war criminals, quislings, and traitors.
3. **Specific groups excluded**:
	* Germans being transferred from other States or who fled to other States from Allied troops do not fall under the action of this declaration.

The resolution also recommends that the Economic and Social Council establish a special committee to carry out promptly an examination and preparation of a report, which will be considered by the second part of the first session of the General Assembly.
