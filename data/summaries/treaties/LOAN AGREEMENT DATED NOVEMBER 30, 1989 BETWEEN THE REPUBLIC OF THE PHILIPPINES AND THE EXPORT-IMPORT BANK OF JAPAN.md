*   **Conditions Precedent (Article X):** Conditions for both the first disbursement (including legal opinions, documentation of authority, and IMF Arrangement details) and each subsequent disbursement (including no Event of Default, accuracy of representations, and IMF Arrangement compliance).  Requires a legal opinion from the Secretary of Justice of the Philippines.

*   **Miscellaneous (Article XIV):** Standard boilerplate provisions.

**Obligations:**

*   Borrower's primary obligation is to repay the loan, interest, and applicable fees.
*   Borrower must comply with covenants related to the Program implementation and refrain from creating prohibited encumbrances.
*   Borrower must maintain compliance with the IMF Arrangement.

**Liabilities:**

*   Failure to comply with repayment obligations or covenants triggers Events of Default.
*   Events of Default allow EXIMBANK to suspend disbursements, cancel the facility, and accelerate repayment of the loan.
*   Borrower indemnifies EXIMBANK against certain losses, including those related to taxes and procurement disputes.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Dual Currency Aspect (Article II):** Loan in Yen equivalent of US$ creates a potential for currency fluctuation risks.
*   **Dependence on IMF Arrangement (Multiple Articles):** Loan heavily tied to IMF Arrangement. Cancellation or material breach of the IMF Arrangement can trigger significant consequences.
*    **Definition of Eligible Items (Article I):** Could be subject to interpretation and dispute if not clearly defined in practice.
*   **Governing Law and Jurisdiction Clause (Article XIII):** While the Borrower has submitted to Japanese jurisdiction and waived immunity, enforceability in the Philippines may be subject to challenge under Philippine law, particularly regarding sovereign immunity.
*   **Pari Passu Clause (Article VII(8), VIII(8)):** Standard clause, but requires careful monitoring to ensure the Philippines does not grant priority to other external debt.
*   **Article VIII(3) (Dispute on Procurement):** The language regarding "necessary steps to ensure that no third party brings or threatens to bring any action to proceedings against the EXIMBANK" is very broad and could lead to disputes about what steps are indeed "necessary".

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   *Sovereign Immunity*: The waiver of immunity in Article XIII should be reviewed in light of international law and Philippine jurisprudence on sovereign immunity, particularly the distinction between *jure imperii* (governmental acts) and *jure gestionis* (commercial acts).
*   *Choice of Law*: Philippine conflict-of-laws rules should be consulted regarding the enforceability of the Japanese choice-of-law provision, especially concerning matters of public policy.
*   *Enforcement of Foreign Judgments*: Philippine Rules of Court on the enforcement of foreign judgments are relevant if EXIMBANK seeks to enforce a Japanese judgment in the Philippines.

**Further Investigation:**

*   Review the IMF Arrangement documents referenced in the Loan Agreement.
*   Analyze the specific laws and regulations of the Philippines concerning external debt and sovereign immunity as of 1989, and any relevant subsequent amendments.
*   Investigate the historical interpretation and application of similar *pari passu* clauses in other sovereign debt agreements.
* Examine the specific rules and regulations of the Central Bank of the Philippines applicable to the loan agreement as of 1989.
* Analyze the potential tax implications under Philippine tax law as of 1989 and subsequent amendments.
