## Summary of Philippines-Spain Social Security Convention Joint Committee Meeting (November 2000)

**Document:** Summary (Final Act) of Proceedings of the Joint Committee Meeting on the Philippines-Spain Convention on Social Security, Madrid, November 27-29, 2000.

**Key Provisions and Agreements:**

*   **Inclusion of Philippine Civil Service Workers:** Agreement to amend Article 2(B) of the Convention to explicitly include Philippine government workers covered by the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). The phrase "for public and private workers" to be added to the definition of "social security legislation." A Transitory Provision to be included to facilitate review of existing benefits.
    *   **Legal Significance:** Clarifies the scope of the convention and ensures coverage for government employees.
*   **Workers of Compa√±ia General de Tabacos de Filipinas (Tabacalera):**
    *   **Decision:** Workers posted by Tabacalera in the Philippines maintain registration and contributions with the Spanish Social Security System retroactively to January 11, 1989 (entry into force of Convention).
    *   **Obligations:** Tabacalera must request a refund from the Philippine SSS for contributions made since the Convention's effective date, contingent on individual worker's consent to suspend/refund Philippine retirement pension. Workers receiving both Spanish and Philippine retirement benefits must refund the Philippine amounts.
    *   **Article 27, Paragraph 1:** Prior contributions in both countries will be considered for benefit entitlement.
    *   **Potential Liabilities:** Tabacalera faces potential administrative burdens in pursuing refunds. Workers may face financial hardship due to refund requirements. This retroactive application may lead to legal challenges based on vested rights or due process.
*   **Amendments to the Convention:** Review and agreement on modifications to the original text. Modified articles and the Protocol are attached as annexes. An English version will be prepared.
*   **Forms:** New Spanish liaison forms provided to replace previous documentation for Article 8,3 of the Administrative Agreement of 21 May 1991.

**Obligations:**

*   **Philippines:** Amend domestic laws/regulations to align with the amended Convention, particularly regarding the inclusion of GSIS members. Processing refunds to Tabacalera.
*   **Spain:** Amend the Convention text, produce the English version, and facilitate the implementation of new liaison forms.
*   **Tabacalera:** Request refunds from the Philippine SSS and potentially assist workers in coordinating refunds.
*   **Workers (Tabacalera):** Potential obligation to refund Philippine pension benefits.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Tabacalera:**  Potential legal challenges related to retroactive application. Administrative costs associated with refund requests.
*   **Workers:** Financial hardship due to refund requirements for dual pensioners.
*   **Philippines & Spain:**  Potential challenges in amending domestic legislation or regulations to fully implement the amendments to the convention.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Legal Challenges:** Retroactive application of the Tabacalera decision could be challenged based on arguments of vested rights, due process, or equal protection under both Philippine and Spanish law.
*   **Implementation Difficulties:** Coordinating refunds and implementing amended legislation across two different legal systems can be complex and time-consuming.
*   **Administrative Burden:** The processes of refund requests, implementation of new forms, and handling potential disputes could create administrative burdens for the involved agencies (SSS, GSIS, Spanish Social Security).
*   **Ambiguity:**  The phrase "workers posted by 'Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas' who render their work activity in that country" is ambiguous. It needs to be clarified what "posted" means and the degree of connection to the Spanish Social Security System is required to maintain coverage.
    
**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The document itself refers to the Philippines-Spain Convention on Social Security (1989) and the Administrative Agreement of 21 May 1991, Article 8,3.
*   Relevant case law would depend on specific disputes arising from the implementation, potentially involving issues of administrative law, international law, social security law, and constitutional law in both countries.
*   Philippine statutory references would include the Social Security Act of 1997 (RA 8282), the GSIS Act of 1997 (RA 8291), and other related regulations.
*   Spanish statutory references would include the General Social Security Act (Ley General de la Seguridad Social) and related regulations.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The retroactive application of the Tabacalera decision is potentially contentious.
*   The vagueness of the wording around "posted workers" and what activities fall under Spanish coverage could lead to disagreements.

**Further Action:**

*   Review the full amended text of the Convention and the Protocol when available in English.
*   Analyze relevant Philippine and Spanish case law regarding vested rights and retroactive application of social security laws.
*   Conduct due diligence on the Tabacalera situation to assess the financial implications and potential legal risks.
*   Clarify the definition of "posted worker" and the activities covered under Spanish social security for those workers.
