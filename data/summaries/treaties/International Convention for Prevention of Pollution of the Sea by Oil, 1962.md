This appears to be a excerpt from an international maritime treaty, specifically Annex B to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The text outlines the regulations for various zones off the coastlines of different countries, including:

1. The Arabian Sea Zone
2. The Bay of Bengal Coastal Zone
3. The Malagasy Zone
4. The Australian Zone

These zones are designated to protect marine ecosystems and prevent overfishing or habitat destruction.

The text also outlines procedures for Contracting Governments to propose changes to the zone boundaries, including:

1. Reduction of a zone
2. Extension of a zone (up to 100 miles from the nearest land)
3. Notification of changes to CITES

Additionally, there are rules regarding the preparation and updating of charts indicating the extent of prohibited zones.

The final section lists countries that have signed the treaty as of December 31, 1965.
