This is a copy of the "Hong Kong-Philippines Extradition Treaty" or the "Extradition Treaty Between the Republic of the Philippines and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China", signed on January 30, 1995.

The treaty outlines the terms and conditions for the extradition of individuals between Hong Kong and the Philippines. It sets forth procedures for the surrender of individuals to be tried in either country, as well as provisions for property surrender, specialty, re-surrender, transit, entry into force, and termination.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Extradition Provisions**: The treaty allows for the extradition of individuals between Hong Kong and the Philippines for offenses committed on either side.
2. **Surrender Requirements**: A request for surrender must be made in writing, signed by the competent authority, and accompanied by all necessary documents.
3. **Property Surrender**: Property surrendered will include articles that may serve as proof of the offense or have been acquired by the individual as a result of the offense.
4. **Specialty Clause**: The treaty ensures that individuals who have been surrendered will not be proceeded against for any offense committed prior to surrender, except in specific circumstances.
5. **Re-Surrender Provisions**: If an individual has already been surrendered and is being tried in Hong Kong or the Philippines, they cannot be surrendered again to another country without consent from both countries.
6. **Transit Permission**: Hong Kong allows for transit through its jurisdiction with the permission of the competent authority.

The treaty was signed on January 30, 1995, and entered into force on April 2, 1995.
