This appears to be a copy of an air services agreement between the Philippines and the United Kingdom, specifically Route 2, which connects Hong Kong with Manila. The document outlines the terms and conditions for airline operations on this route.

The agreement covers several key points:

1. **Designation of airlines**: The UK has designated certain airlines, including Philippine Air Lines and Cathay Airways, to operate on Route 2. However, there is an understanding that if a second airline is designated by the UK, the two governments will consult under Article 10 of the agreement to ensure capacity is in accordance with Article 6.
2. **Fiscal treatment**: The UK has pointed out disparities in fiscal treatment between British and Philippine airline operators. The Philippines will bring this matter to the attention of relevant authorities to ensure that designated airlines are treated equally.
3. **Carriage of traffic**: Airlines designated by the Philippine Government may carry traffic on Route 2, but with limitations: they must not carry more than two flights per week on a Hong Kong-Formosa route without specific authorization from the Hong Kong Government.

The agreement also includes provisions for flexibility in scheduling and capacity, allowing designated airlines to omit points on their routes "if and when desired".

This document is likely to be part of a larger air services agreement between the Philippines and the UK, which would cover multiple routes and airline designations.
