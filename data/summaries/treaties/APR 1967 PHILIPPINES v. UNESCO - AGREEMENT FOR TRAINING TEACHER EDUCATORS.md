This is a treaty agreement between the Philippines and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), signed on April 17, 1967. The agreement establishes an Institute in the Philippines to promote teacher education in Asia.

Here's a brief summary of the key points:

2. **UNESCO assistance**: UNESCO will provide advice, co-operation, and financial support for the establishment and maintenance of the Institute.
3. **Financial contributions**: The Government of the Philippines will increase its contribution to the Institute starting from 1969, proportionally increasing it to enable full financial support when UNESCO assistance ends.
4. **Regional character**: The Government agrees to maintain the regional character of the Institute in accordance with its purpose.
5. **Obligations of UNESCO**: UNESCO will provide international staff, travel expenses for staff, and research grants for studies and research on teacher education in Asia.

Some notable provisions include:

* Article 9: Neither the Government nor the Institute will be considered an agent or staff member of UNESCO, and will not receive privileges, immunities, or compensation from UNESCO.
