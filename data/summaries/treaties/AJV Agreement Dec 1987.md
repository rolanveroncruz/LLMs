The ASEAN Industrial Joint Venture (AIJV) Programme Agreement is a comprehensive framework for promoting industrial cooperation and trade among ASEAN member countries. The agreement aims to encourage the establishment of joint ventures among companies from different ASEAN countries, with the goal of increasing economic integration, promoting technology transfer, and enhancing regional competitiveness.

Key aspects of the AIJV Programme Agreement include:

1. **Margin of Preference**: Participating countries grant a margin of preference to each other for certain products manufactured by joint ventures.
2. **Tariff Preferences**: Non-participating countries may become participating countries at any time, and shall extend the same margin of tariff preference for that product.
3. **Local Content**: Joint venture products are granted local-content accreditation in participating countries with local-content programs.
4. **Dumping Protection**: Participating countries protect against dumping and unfair trade practices affecting AIJV projects.
5. **Tariff Rates**: Tariff rates applicable to similar products are not lowered below the prevailing level for a four-year period from commercial operations.
6. **Zero Duty**: Binding zero duty is regarded as fulfilling the requirement of extending the minimum 90% margin of preference.

The agreement also establishes the ASEAN Industrial Joint Venture Programme Management (AIJVOM) to oversee implementation and provide support for participating countries.

**Supplementary Provisions**

* The agreement repeals previous agreements, including the Basic Agreement on ASEAN Industrial Joint Ventures (1983) and Supplementary Agreements (1987).
* All articles may be modified through amendments agreed upon by consensus.
* This agreement supersedes earlier agreements upon its entry into force.
