1. Payment rates: The US government agrees to pay a certain rate per diem basis for hospitalization and treatment of veterans.
2. Hospital facilities and standards: The agreement includes provisions regarding the quality and adequacy of hospital facilities, procedures, and techniques in the Philippines.
3. Reimbursement of unobligated funds: Unobligated appropriations for medical care and research grants will be reverted to the US Treasury at the end of the fiscal year if not expended.
4. Consultations on compliance: The agreement includes a provision for immediate consultation between the US and Philippine governments to ensure compliance with terms and conditions.

The MOU also addresses various other issues, such as:

1. Termination and amendment: The agreement will terminate on April 25, 1967, unless amended or revoked by subsequent agreement.
2. Liability protection: The Philippines agrees to save harmless all officers and employees of the US Veterans Administration from civil actions arising out of their performance of duties under the MOU.
3. Immigration and taxation: The agreement includes provisions regarding visa and passport regulations, as well as exemptions from certain taxes and duties on funds or property used for purposes under the MOU.

The document is signed by representatives of both governments, including James M. Wilson Jr., Charge d'Affaires at the American Embassy in Manila, and Jose D. Ingles, Acting Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines.
