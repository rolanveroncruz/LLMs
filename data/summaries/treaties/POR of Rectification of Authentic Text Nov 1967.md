==========================================================================================

### **Key Provisions**

*   The agreement was rectified to correct printing errors in the authentic English text.

### **Obligations**

### **Liabilities**

### **Potential Risks**

*   Ambiguous clause 8, which states that the corrections apply to certified true copies of the Agreement. This raises questions about whether these copies are considered the original text.
*   The lack of clear language regarding the effective date of the rectification may lead to disputes or difficulties in applying the corrected provisions.

### **Relevant Case Law**

### **Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses**

 Clause 8:
"The certified true copies of the Agreement, established on the basis of the original text, contain the above-mentioned errors."

The implications of these words are unclear. Do they refer to the original authenticated copy, or do they imply that all subsequent authenticated copies are considered the original?

Clause 9:
"directors" should read "Directors".

This clause is unclear in its application to international agreements. Does this change refer to a grammatical correction or a substantive change?
