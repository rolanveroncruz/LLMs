It appears that you've provided a lengthy document, likely an international treaty or convention related to postal services between the United States and the Philippines. I'll summarize the main points of the Convention for Parcel Post Service between the two countries.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Dispatches**: Each dispatch must include the serial number, contents, weight, and total number of sacks.
2. **Verification**: Upon receipt, the destination exchange office verifies the dispatch bill and sends a bulletin of verification to the dispatching exchange office if any errors or omissions are found.
3. **Corrections**: The dispatching exchange office may return the bulletin with observations and attach it to the parcel bills.
4. **Damage or Insufficient Packing**: If a parcel is damaged or insufficiently packed, the office must repack it, preserving the original packing as far as possible.
5. **Exchange of Mails**: Matters not covered by this Convention will be governed by the Universal Postal Convention and Regulations in force between the two countries.
6. **Regulations and Changes**: The Postmaster General and Secretary of Public Works and Communications have authority to make regulations, provide for changes, and modify the Convention as necessary.

**Ratification and Effective Date:**

1. The Convention will take effect on a date to be mutually decided upon by both countries.
2. It will continue in force until terminated or annulled with six months' notice given to the other country.
