**Amendment to Framework Agreement on Enhancing ASEAN Economic Cooperation**

### Key Provisions:

#### Article 1:
* Amends Article 2, section A, paragraph 1 of the original agreement by deleting "15 years" and substituting it with "10 years (beginning 1 January 1993)".

#### Article 2:
* Inserts new Article 12A to provide for accession of new members to the Agreement on terms and conditions consistent with it.

#### Article 3:
* Enters into force upon deposit of instruments of ratification or acceptance by all signatory governments, not later than 1 January 1996.

### Obligations:

* Member countries are required to accede to the agreement on terms and conditions agreed upon between them and existing members.
* Countries must deposit their ratifications with the Secretary-General of ASEAN by 1 January 1996.

### Liabilities:

* No specific liabilities are mentioned in the protocol, but countries may be liable for non-compliance with the agreement's provisions.

### Potential Risks:

* **Ambiguous Clause**: The term "terms and conditions consistent with it" in Article 2 is unclear and may lead to disputes among member countries regarding the interpretation of this provision.
* **Non-Compliance Liability**: The lack of explicit liability clauses for non-compliance may result in uncertain outcomes for countries that fail to adhere to the agreement's provisions.

### Relevance to Case Law and Statutory References:

* This protocol does not directly reference any specific case law. However, it is essential to consider relevant decisions related to ASEAN member states' agreements and trade policies.
* No statutory references are provided in this document, but relevant laws and regulations may be found in the ASEAN Charter and other relevant legislation.

### Recommended Course of Action:

* Carefully review Article 2's new provision (Article 12A) to understand its implications on accession and membership procedures.
* Consider consulting with fellow members and stakeholders regarding potential disputes or concerns related to this article.
* Be aware of potential liabilities for non-compliance, but take necessary steps to ensure adherence to the agreement's provisions.
