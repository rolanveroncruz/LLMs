**Parties:** Republic of the Philippines and United States of America, acting through A.I.D.

**Purpose:** Defines the program of economic support from the U.S. to the Philippines contemplated under Article IX of the 1988 Memorandum of Agreement relating to the Military Bases Agreement (pursuant to the Exchange of Notes dated January 1, 1979).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Cash Transfer Assistance (Article I):** $218 million in ESF grants from A.I.D. to the Philippines.

    *   $49 million obligated in 1990 (subject to FY1990 Congressional appropriation).
    *   Disbursement schedule outlined (initial, January 1, 1990, July 1, 1990).
    *   Dollars disbursed to be deposited into a USD special account and used to pay Philippine official debt to multilateral lending institutions, or as otherwise agreed.
    *   Peso equivalent of USD disbursements to be deposited into a peso special account with prioritized uses.
    *   Specific allocations for 1) implementation of Annex to the Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation, which entered into force on May 21, 1951; 2) accounting and monitoring services for the cash transfer program; and 3) essential services in education, health, population, and environment.
    *   Condition Precedent: Consultation between Philippines and A.I.D. regarding implementation of the Annex to the Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation prior to the first and third disbursements.

    *   Requirement to determine purposes and activities for allocation of USD 48 million by June 1, 1990.

*   **Further Agreements (Article III):**
    *   The MOU constitutes the agreement on the assistance program and the Philippines' request for such assistance.
    *   Obligation for both parties to proceed with all deliberate speed to negotiate and enter into further definitive agreements.

**Potential Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Conditional Funding:** Obligations are subject to the availability of funds, particularly Congressional appropriations in the U.S. Failure of appropriation could lead to breach or non-performance.
*   **Discretionary Disbursement:** Disbursement terms and conditions are subject to further agreement between the Philippines and A.I.D., creating potential for disputes.
*   **Peso Account Usage:** Priorities for the peso special account could become contentious, potentially impacting the Philippines' budget.
*   **Compliance Risks:** Failure to meet the condition precedent requiring consultation regarding implementation of the Annex to the Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation may trigger liability issues. Likewise, the Government of the Philippines may be liable for compliance issues for failing to satisfy the reporting requirements under the preceding Grant Agreements.
*   **Ambiguity:** The term "mutually agreed upon" in Article II, Section 2, introduces ambiguity, and disputes may arise if the parties disagree on the specifics of "economic development projects and programs" or "sector support programs."

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Memorandum of Agreement dated October 17, 1988 (referenced).
*   Exchange of Notes dated January 1, 1979 (referenced).
*   Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation, entered into force on May 21, 1951 (referenced).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "assure continued progress in implementation of agreed on Philippine economic and administrative reforms" in Article I, Section 2, provides no objective metric for measurement, allowing room for subjective interpretation.
*   The use of “approximately” when allocating funding for the Regional Development Fund Project, Rural Infrastructure Fund Project, Project Design Project, and Technical Resources Project (Article II, Section 1) may give rise to disputes because amounts may change.

**Overall Assessment:**

The MOU sets forth a framework for a significant economic support program from the U.S. to the Philippines. While defining some specific obligations, it leaves considerable discretion to A.I.D. and requires further agreements, increasing the potential for disputes. The conditional nature of funding and the subjectivity of certain clauses present potential risks. A thorough review of related agreements and applicable U.S. law (Foreign Assistance Act) is warranted.
