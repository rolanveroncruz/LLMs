This is a bilateral agreement between two countries, the Republic of the Philippines and the Kingdom of Norway, related to maritime labor issues. The agreement aims to regulate the rights and responsibilities of seafarers working on vessels registered in one country but operating in the waters of the other country.

The key points of the agreement include:

1. **Admission of crew members**: Crew members are allowed to enter and stay in the territory of the other Contracting Party for a specific period, provided they have a written declaration from the shipping company or its agents.
2. **Medical observation and treatment**: If a crew member requires medical attention, the competent authorities of the latter country will give permission for them to stay in their territory for as long as necessary.
3. **Rules on labor disputes**: Disputes related to employment contracts, wages, and other labor issues are referred to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts or tribunals of the Contracting Party where the vessel is registered or where the complainant is a national.
4. **Offenses committed by crew members**: If an offense is suspected on board a vessel, the competent authorities of one Contracting Party can request evidence and take proceedings in the case, subject to certain conditions.
5. **Amendments to the agreement**: The Contracting Parties agree to consult each other for amending the terms of the present Agreement, with amendments requiring mutual consent.

The agreement also sets out the procedures for entry into force, including the notification of diplomatic channels and the termination of provisional application after five years.

This agreement aims to promote cooperation between the two countries in regulating maritime labor issues and providing a framework for resolving disputes related to employment contracts and other labor-related matters.
