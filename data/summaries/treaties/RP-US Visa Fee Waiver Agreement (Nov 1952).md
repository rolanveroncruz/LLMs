## Summary of RP-US Agreement on Waiver of Non-Immigrant Visa Fees (1952)

**Nature:** Bilateral agreement, established via exchange of notes, providing for reciprocal waiver of non-immigrant passport visa fees for citizens of the Philippines and the United States visiting each other's territory for temporary periods for business or pleasure.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Reciprocal Waiver:** Agreement provides for the reciprocal abolition or waiver of non-immigrant passport visa fees.
*   **Scope:** Covers citizens visiting for temporary periods for business or pleasure.
*   **Philippine Implementation:** The Philippine government will be guided by the conditions set forth in Executive Order No. 535 (October 10, 1952) regarding the abolition or waiver of such fees.  This E.O. itself is *not* included in the provided document, but is crucial for understanding the specific conditions imposed by the Philippines.
*   **US Implementation:** The US government will be guided by its pertinent immigration laws and regulations.  Specific statutes and regulations are *not* named, necessitating further research to determine the controlling provisions.
*   **Effective Date:** December 24, 1952.
*   **Termination:** Remains in force until altered or terminated by mutual consultation.

**Obligations:**

*   Both governments obligated to waive non-immigrant passport visa fees for eligible citizens.
*   Philippines obligated to implement the waiver in accordance with Executive Order No. 535.
*   US obligated to implement the waiver in accordance with its immigration laws and regulations.

**Liabilities:**

*   The agreement does not explicitly address liabilities for improper implementation or enforcement of the waiver. However, general principles of international law regarding treaty violations would apply. Any violation may result in diplomatic pressure, renegotiation of the agreement, or, in extreme cases, termination.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Executive Order 535:**  Crucial to understand the Philippine side of the agreement.  The absence of this document creates a significant gap in the analysis.  Its conditions may impose limitations or qualifications on the waiver, potentially leading to disputes.
*   **US Immigration Laws & Regulations:** The agreement's reliance on "pertinent immigration laws and regulations" of the US creates ambiguity. These laws and regulations are subject to change, potentially altering the scope of the waiver. Current US regulations and relevant sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) need to be reviewed.
*   **Definition of "Temporary Periods for Business or Pleasure":** This phrase is inherently subjective. Disputes may arise concerning the permitted length of stay or activities considered within the scope of "business" or "pleasure."
*   **"Mutual Consultation" for Alteration/Termination:** The agreement does not specify the procedures or requirements for "mutual consultation." This could lead to disputes regarding the validity of any attempted alteration or termination.
*   **Statutory Overrides:** US law may supercede this agreement, based on the "last-in-time" rule. It is important to check if any subsequent statutes have been passed that affect this agreement.

**Case Law & Statutory References (Needed):**

*   **Executive Order No. 535 (Philippines):** Essential to understand the specific conditions imposed by the Philippines.
*   **Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (US):** Relevant provisions governing visa requirements and waivers.
*   **US immigration regulations (specifically related to visa waivers).**
*   **Case Law:** Cases involving treaty interpretation, the "last-in-time" rule, and the application of US immigration laws.

**Recommendations:**

*   Obtain and analyze Executive Order No. 535 to fully understand the Philippine conditions.
*   Thoroughly research and analyze relevant US immigration laws and regulations to determine the current scope of the waiver.
*   Investigate whether any subsequent US statutes have been passed that could potentially override or modify the agreement.
*   Consider potential scenarios that could lead to disputes and draft language to clarify ambiguous terms (e.g., "temporary periods," "business," "pleasure") should the agreement be renegotiated.
