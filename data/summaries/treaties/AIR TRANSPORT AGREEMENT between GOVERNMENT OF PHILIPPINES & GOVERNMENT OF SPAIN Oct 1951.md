This appears to be an excerpt from an international air transportation agreement between Spain and the Philippines, specifically Annex A. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

**Rights and Obligations**

The airline of each Contracting Party has the right to:

* Transit through the territory of the other country
* Make non-traffic stops at airports open for international traffic
* Embark or disembark passengers, cargo, and mail in the territory of either country

However, these rights come with conditions, including:

* Meeting traffic requirements between terminal points on specified routes
* Having equal opportunities to operate on specified routes
* Providing adequate capacity for normal, reasonable, and anticipated demands
* Modifying capacities based on statistical traffic data

**Consultation and Coordination**

The Contracting Parties agree to consult each other periodically (within 15 days) or on request to:

* Share traffic statistical data
* Provide information about traffic transported by their airlines along agreed routes
* Discuss fare and rate adjustments

**Fares and Rates**

Fares and rates for transport of passengers, cargo, and mail shall be established through mutual agreement between the Parties, with consideration of data from the International Air Transportation Association (IATA). These fares and rates shall be subject to approval by the Contracting Parties.

**Dispute Resolution**

In case of disagreement among airlines or between the Parties, disputes shall be submitted for arbitration as provided in Article XIV of the Agreement.
