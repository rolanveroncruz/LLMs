**CONSTITUTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION INSTRUMENT OF AMENDMENT 1953**

### Key Provisions:

#### Obligations

* The Philippines deposited its instrument of ratification with the Director-General of the ILO on February 29, 1956.
* All Members of the International Labour Organization are required to notify the Director-General of their formal ratifications or acceptances of this Instrument of Amendment.

#### Liabilities

* There is no explicit liability clause in the document. However, Article 36 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization states that the Organization shall not be liable for any damages or losses arising from the breach by a Member of its obligations under the Constitution.

### Potential Risks:

* The absence of a liability clause may lead to uncertainty regarding the rights and responsibilities of Members in case of non-compliance with the provisions of this Instrument of Amendment.
* The lack of clarity on the consequences of non-ratification or non-acceptance by Member States may create disputes and potential conflicts.

### Relevant Case Law:

* None, as there is no relevant case law to cite.

### Statutory References:

* Article 7 (paragraphs 1, 2, and 8) of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization
* Article 36 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization
* Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations

### Ambiguous or Controversial Clauses:

* The absence of a liability clause may be seen as ambiguous, leaving room for interpretation regarding the rights and responsibilities of Members.
* The phrase "the Director-General shall notify all the Members of the International Labour Organization and the Secretary-General of the United Nations" in Article 6(3) may be considered vague, potentially leading to disputes on compliance.

### Final Thoughts:

This Instrument of Amendment makes significant changes to the Constitution of the International Labour Organization, particularly regarding the representation of Members in the Governing Body. Lawyers should carefully review the document and consider potential implications for their clients and the broader international labour community.
