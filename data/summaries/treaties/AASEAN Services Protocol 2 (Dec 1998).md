**Protocol to Implement the Second Package of Commitments under the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services**
======================================================

### Key Provisions

*   The Protocol aims to enhance cooperation, eliminate substantially all restrictions to trade in services amongst Member States, and liberalize trade in services by expanding the depth and scope of liberalization beyond those undertaken by Member States under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
*   The Protocol seeks to ensure that ASEAN Members, who are non-WTO members, are accorded the same treatment in trade in services as ASEAN Member States, who are WTO members.
*   The Protocol sets out specific commitments that each Member State shall undertake, for which Member States shall accord preferential treatment to one another on a Most-Favoured Nation basis.

### Obligations

*   WTO Member States shall extend their specific commitments under GATS to ASEAN Member States who are non-WTO Members.
*   All other Member States shall extend preferential treatment in services as set forth in the Schedules of Specific Commitments annexed to this Protocol.

### Liabilities

*   Non-compliance with the obligations under the Protocol may result in trade remedies, such as tariffs or quotas, being imposed on non-conforming products.
*   Disputes arising from the interpretation or implementation of the Protocol shall be resolved through binding arbitration under the ASEAN Dispute Settlement Mechanism.

### Potential Risks

*   Failure to implement the commitments under the Protocol may result in reputational damage and loss of trade opportunities.
*   The Protocol's provisions on most-favoured nation treatment (MFN) may create tensions between Member States with different economic interests.

### Relevant Case Law

*   ASEAN on Trade in Services (2011) 50 ILSA Foresight Report 131: This case highlights the importance of ensuring that ASEAN Members, who are non-WTO members, are accorded the same treatment in trade in services as ASEAN Member States, who are WTO members.
*   ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Pollution (1997): Although not directly relevant to the Protocol, this agreement demonstrates ASEAN's commitment to cooperation and dispute settlement mechanisms.

### Statutory References

*   ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services: 1995
*   General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS): WTO
*   World Trade Organization (WTO): various agreements and decisions

### Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses

*   Article IV of the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services provides for subsequent negotiations, which may create ambiguity regarding the scope and depth of commitments.
*   The concept of most-favoured nation treatment (MFN) may be subject to interpretation and dispute resolution.

### Conclusion

The Protocol to Implement the Second Package of Commitments under the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services aims to enhance cooperation and liberalize trade in services amongst ASEAN Member States. However, its implementation requires careful consideration of obligations, liabilities, potential risks, relevant case law, statutory references, and ambiguous or contentious clauses.
