## Summary of Zamboanga del Sur Development Project Phase II Memorandum of Understanding (ZDSP-II MOU) Amendments (November 23, 1984)

This document amends the existing ZDSP-II MOU signed November 11, 1981, between Australia and the Philippines, concerning the Zamboanga del Sur Development Project. The core amendment involves transitioning project responsibilities to Philippine agencies.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Objective (Clause 1.2):** Shifts focus to consolidate program activities and build capacity within Philippine agencies in Zamboanga del Sur for project functions upon Australian withdrawal (December 1985).
*   **Organizational Structure (Clauses 2.1 - 2.10, Annex II):** Restructures national and regional coordination bodies. Places the National Council on Integrated Area Development (NACIAD) as the primary coordinating authority. Establishes a ZDSP National Committee (advisory and policy-making), an Inter-Agency Regional Advisory Committee (regional/provincial participation), a Manila Liaison Office (communication with Australian Embassy, Cabinet Coordinator & participating Agencies at the National Level), and a Project Office in Pagadian City headed by a Project Director reporting to NACIAD. Technical Coordinating Committee functions are subsumed within the Provincial Development Council of the provincial government.
*   **Agency Responsibilities (Clause 2.7):** Designated line agencies are responsible for implementing project components. Requires Memoranda of Agreement between agencies and the project to delineate funding and planning, including institutionalisation of activities. Project officers will be appointed to coordinate and assist implementation of all ZDSP projects and report to both the Project Director and the concerned Ministry.
*   **Australian Executive Officer (Clause 2.8, Annex II):** Role remains, providing management advice to the Project Director and technical assistance to Philippine agencies. Consults closely with Philippine authorities (Clause 5.1).
*   **Funding (Clause 4, Annex VI):** Amended to A$23,500,000 for the Australian Government contribution.
*   **Project Reviews (Clause 6):** Field reviews every six months to ascertain capacity developed in line agencies. Reviews report to the ZDSP National Committee for discussion and decisions.
*   **Road Construction Program (Annex 1):** ZDSP-II will complete roads from the approved 1983 road construction program and the MPWH is responsible for bridge construction.
*   **Sibugay Valley Irrigation Scheme (Annex 1):** Full responsibility for construction vested in the National Irrigation Authority (NIA) effective January 1, 1984.
*   **On-Farm Development (Annex 1):** Emphasis shifts to developing line agency capacity for on-farm development, prioritizing multiple cropping, livestock, and freshwater fisheries.
*   **Training (Annex 1):** Responsibility for training and skills development vested with the National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC).

**Liabilities and Indemnification (Clause 7):**

*   The Philippine Government will handle claims against the Australian Government, its servants, or Australian personnel arising from operations under the MOU.
*   Indemnification is provided to the Australian Government and personnel *except* in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined through mutual consultation.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Transition Risk:** Success hinges on the effective transfer of skills and capacity to Philippine agencies within a limited timeframe (December 1985). Failure to adequately prepare these agencies could jeopardize project sustainability. The Memoranda of Agreement called for in Clause 2.7 will be critical.
*   **Coordination Complexities:** Multiple layers of coordination (NACIAD, National Committee, Regional Committee, Project Office, Manila Liaison Office) could lead to bureaucratic delays and inefficiencies. Clear lines of authority and communication will be essential.
*   **Liability Clause (Clause 7):** The "gross negligence or willful misconduct" exception to the indemnity clause is ambiguous. The lack of specific definition could lead to disputes regarding its interpretation. The clause regarding ‘mutual consultation and determination by the two governments’ is also ambiguous regarding who makes the final determination and the process required for such a determination.
*   **Enforcement of MoA:** The Memoranda of Agreement between agencies are supposed to delineate funding and planning agreements; however, lack of specific details leaves it open to interpretation.

**Statutory References and Case Law:**

*   References to Philippine agencies like NACIAD, NIA, MPWH, etc., imply adherence to the existing organic laws establishing and governing these bodies.
*   No explicit statutory citations are included in the amendments themselves. Any legal action would likely reference relevant Philippine laws regarding government contracts, torts (negligence), and potentially international agreements if treaty status is involved.
*   The indemnification clause might be subject to interpretation under Philippine civil law and jurisprudence regarding liability, negligence, and contractual obligations. Case law on similar indemnity provisions could be relevant.

**Further Questions for Client:**

*   Status of the Memoranda of Agreement that are to be put in place between the agencies involved.
*   Details of the handover process.
*   Clarification of the indemnification clause (Clause 7) and its application in hypothetical scenarios.

This summary provides a legally precise overview of the amendments, highlighting key provisions, obligations, potential risks, and areas requiring further scrutiny.
