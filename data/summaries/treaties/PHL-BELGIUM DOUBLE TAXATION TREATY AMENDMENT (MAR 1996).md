This is a treaty between the Philippines and Belgium regarding taxation, specifically double taxation and fiscal cooperation. Here's a breakdown of the main points:

**Article 1: General Provisions**

* The agreement aims to avoid double taxation and fiscal evasion.
* It applies to taxes covered by the original Agreement.

**Article 2: Taxation in Belgium**

* A resident of Belgium deriving income taxable in the Philippines shall be exempt from Belgian tax on that income.
* However, if other income is taxed in Belgium, the exemption does not affect the rate of tax applied.

**Article 3: Taxation in the Philippines**

* A resident of Belgium deriving income taxable in Belgium shall be allowed to claim a credit against Philippine tax for taxes paid or accrued to Belgium on dividends.
* The credit is limited to the part of the Belgian tax, as computed before the deduction, that is attributable to the income taxed in Belgium.

**Article 4: Double Taxation**

* A resident of Belgium may derive items of income taxable in both countries under certain conditions. In such cases:
	+ (i) Belgium shall allow a credit for taxes paid or accrued on dividends, interest, and royalty payments.
	+ (ii) The credit is limited to 10% of the gross amount of the income and applies only for the first ten years.

**Article 5: Losses**
