**Memorandum of Understanding Analysis: Philippines-Indonesia Counter-Terrorism Cooperation**

**Document:** Memorandum of Understanding Between the Anti-Terrorism Council of the Republic of the Philippines and the National Counter-Terrorism Agency of the Republic of Indonesia on Combating International Terrorism (June 2, 2014).

**Summary:** This MOU establishes a framework for cooperation between the Philippines' ATC and Indonesia's NCTA to prevent, suppress, and combat international terrorism and related transnational criminal activities. It focuses on intelligence sharing, law enforcement cooperation, capacity building, and other areas related to counter-terrorism.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1 (Objective):** Establishes the MOU's goal of cooperation in combating international terrorism and related crimes, emphasizing mutual respect, sovereignty, equality, and mutual benefit.
*   **Article 2 (Scope of Cooperation):** Outlines areas of cooperation, including intelligence sharing, enhanced law enforcement collaboration, and capacity building through training, exchange programs, seminars, and joint exercises.
*   **Article 3 (Areas of Cooperation):** Specifies areas like border control, information exchange, capacity building, deradicalization, cyber terrorism, and joint exercises.
*   **Article 4 (Cooperation Mechanism):** Designates Communication cum Liaison Centers (CCL) - ATC-PMC (Philippines) and Deputy for International Cooperation of the Indonesian National Counter Terrorism Agency. Establishes a Joint Working Group (JWG) to formulate policies, implement programs, coordinate activities, and evaluate results. The JWG must meet at least once a year in alternating locations.
*   **Article 7 (Confidentiality):** Restricts the disclosure of confidential information to third parties without the express consent of the other party.
*   **Article 8 (Refusal of Requests):** Allows a party to refuse assistance if it prejudices state sovereignty, national security, or public interests, with a notification requirement within 30 days.
*   **Article 10 (Duration):** The MOU is effective for three years, automatically renewable for subsequent three-year periods unless terminated with three months' written notice.

**Obligations:**

*   Both Parties are obligated to implement the MOU according to their respective domestic laws.
*   Both Parties are obligated to establish a Joint Working Group which must meet at least once a year.
*   Both Parties are obligated to keep confidential information confidential.
*   Both Parties are obligated to provide each other with a notification of refusal.
*   Both Parties are obligated to engage in consultations or negotiations to settle disputes.

**Liabilities:**

*   The MOU doesn't explicitly define liabilities for breaches. Any liability would likely arise from violations of domestic laws during the implementation of cooperative activities.
*   Potential liability could stem from the misuse or unauthorized disclosure of shared intelligence, potentially implicating either state under international law principles of state responsibility.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Enforcement Mechanism:** The MOU lacks a specific enforcement mechanism, relying on good faith cooperation.
*   **Domestic Law Conflicts:** Cooperation is contingent upon each party's domestic laws, which could create limitations or conflicts. *Case Law Relevance*: Domestic law requirements such as privacy laws or security laws need to be considered in the information exchange.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Potential risk of confidential information being leaked or misused, despite Article 7. *Statutory Reference*: Each country's laws pertaining to data protection, national security, and official secrets apply.
*   **Article 8 (Refusal of Requests):** Broad language regarding "state sovereignty, national security, or public interests" provides significant discretion in refusing requests, potentially hindering cooperation.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Philippines:** *Human Security Act of 2007* (RA 9372, as amended by RA 11479 - Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020): Governs counter-terrorism efforts in the Philippines and provides legal context for activities undertaken under the MOU.
*   **Indonesia:** *Law No. 5 of 2018 on the Eradication of Criminal Acts of Terrorism*. The Indonesian law on terrorism provides legal context for activities undertaken under the MOU.
*   **International Law:** Principles of state sovereignty, non-intervention, and customary international law regarding state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts are relevant.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Article 8 (Refusal of Requests):** The broad discretion granted in refusing requests could be a contentious point if one party frequently invokes it. The 30-day notification requirement is beneficial, but the lack of specific criteria for refusal could lead to disputes.

**Recommendations:**

*   Clarify the types of information considered "confidential" and the procedures for handling it.
*   Develop specific protocols for intelligence sharing to ensure compliance with domestic laws.
*   Establish a dispute resolution mechanism beyond "consultations or negotiations" to address potential conflicts arising from differing interpretations of the MOU.
*   Regularly review and update the MOU to reflect evolving counter-terrorism strategies and address any identified shortcomings.
*   Consider including provisions addressing data protection and privacy rights in the context of information sharing.
