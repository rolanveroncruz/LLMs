## Summary of Philippines-Israel Arrangement on Gainful Occupation for Family Members of Diplomats and Consular Staff

This arrangement (entered into force Feb 11, 2013) between the Philippines and Israel addresses the ability of family members of diplomatic and consular personnel to engage in gainful employment in the receiving state.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1:** Authorizes family members to engage in gainful occupation in the receiving state, subject to its applicable legislation and specific exclusions. Explicitly reserves the receiving state's right to withhold authorization for employment by the receiving state itself (including its agencies and corporations), activities affecting national security, and professions reserved for nationals. Authorization is valid only during the diplomat/consul's tenure plus three months.
*   **Article 2:** Defines "member of a diplomatic mission or consular post" and "member of the family," including spouses/de-facto spouses, unmarried dependent children under 21, dependent children under 25 in full-time higher education, and unmarried children who are disabled but able to work.
*   **Article 3:** Lays out the procedure for authorization, requiring a request from the sending state's embassy specifying the position, employer details, and any other required information. The receiving state's authorities check eligibility and internal provisions before informing the embassy of authorization. Separate authorization is required for changing employers. Authorization does not imply exemption from standard employment requirements, procedures, or fees. The arrangement does not imply recognition of degrees for pursuing a profession.
*   **Article 4:** Waives civil and administrative immunity for family members who enjoy it under the Vienna Conventions (Diplomatic Relations 1961, Consular Relations 1963) in respect of acts/omissions in the course of their employment. Critically, it specifies that this waiver *does not* extend to immunity from execution of sentences, requiring a specific waiver.
*   **Article 5:** Addresses criminal immunity. Immunity continues for acts/omissions during employment, but the sending state must seriously consider waiving criminal immunity in cases of "serious offenses" upon the receiving state's written request. This waiver also doesn't extend to immunity from execution of sentences without a specific waiver.
*   **Article 6:** Subjects family members to the receiving state's fiscal and social security regimes for matters related to their employment, referencing the Vienna Conventions.
*   **Article 7:** Mandates settlement of disputes through mutual consultations.
*   **Article 8:** Sets out the entry into force upon later written notification by the Parties indicating compliance with domestic requirements.

**Obligations:**

*   **Receiving State:** To consider employment requests in good faith, subject to domestic laws and the specified exclusions. To inform the sending state of the decision.
*   **Sending State:** To submit complete and accurate employment requests. To "seriously consider" waiving criminal immunity for serious offenses committed during employment.
*   **Family Members:** To comply with the receiving state's laws and regulations related to employment.
*   **Both States:** To engage in mutual consultations to resolve disputes arising from the agreement.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Receiving State:** Potential liability for failure to properly consider requests or for discriminatory application of its laws. Exposure to disputes regarding the interpretation of "national security" or "professions reserved for nationals."
*   **Sending State:** Potential diplomatic strain if it refuses to waive criminal immunity for serious offenses, potentially impacting relations with the receiving state.
*   **Family Members:** Legal exposure for acts/omissions during employment, particularly regarding civil and administrative jurisdiction (due to waiver). Uncertainty regarding the definition and application of "serious offenses" in Article 5. They are obligated to comply with host country fiscal and social security mandates.
*   **Ambiguous Clauses:**

    *   **"Serious offenses" (Article 5):** Lacks a clear definition, potentially leading to disputes over when a waiver of criminal immunity is warranted. Requires a close look at interpretations within the two legal systems, referring to relevant precedents or statutes that might give it meaning.
    *   **"National Security" (Article 1):** Broad and potentially subject to expansive interpretation by the receiving state, potentially limiting employment opportunities.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961):** Provides the underlying framework for diplomatic immunity, particularly regarding civil, administrative, and criminal jurisdiction. This agreement operates as a specific exception to the general rules of immunity, which case law consistently interprets narrowly.
*   **Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (1963):**  Relevant for consular staff and their families, with similar implications for immunity as the Diplomatic Relations Convention.
*   **Domestic Employment Laws of Philippines & Israel:** The agreement explicitly subordinates itself to the receiving state's employment laws. These laws must be consulted for specific requirements, procedures, and regulations that family members must adhere to.
*   **Case Law on Diplomatic Immunity:**  Courts in both the Philippines and Israel (and internationally) have addressed the scope and limitations of diplomatic immunity. Precedents involving waiver of immunity, or situations where actions fall outside the scope of official duties, would be relevant.
*   **Relevant local laws:** This agreement also falls under international law principles regarding treaty interpretation, such as the principle of good faith. Interpretation should also align with the object and purpose of the treaty - which is to facilitate the employment of family members without undermining the receiving stateâ€™s laws and national interests.

**Recommendations:**

*   Review the domestic employment laws of both the Philippines and Israel to fully understand the obligations imposed.
*   Clarify the definition of "serious offenses" through diplomatic channels or supplemental agreements to avoid future disputes.
*   Draft internal guidelines for embassies and consulates regarding the process for requesting and considering waivers of immunity.
*   Advise family members of the potential legal risks associated with employment in the receiving state, particularly regarding the waiver of immunity.
