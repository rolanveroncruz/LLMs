**FAO Constitution Amendments November 4, 1967**

**Key Provisions:**

* The FAO Council will consist of 34 member nations, each with one representative and one vote.
* Member nations can appoint alternates, associates, and advisers to their representatives, but these individuals will not have voting rights except in the case of an alternate participating on behalf of a representative.
* No representative can represent more than one member nation.

**Obligations:**

* Member nations are obligated to participate in the Council's proceedings and adhere to its rules and decisions.
* The Conference has the authority to determine the conditions for alternates, associates, and advisers' participation in the Council's proceedings.

**Liabilities:**

* **Potential Liability:** Failure by a member nation to comply with FAO regulations or resolutions may result in penalties, fines, or other consequences.
* **Liability for Representative's Actions:** A representative's actions while participating in the Council's proceedings may be attributed to their home country, potentially exposing that country to liability.

**Relevant Case Law:**

* None explicitly mentioned, but relevant cases on international organizations and representation might be applicable (e.g., _United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp._, 1936).

**Statutory References:**

* **FAO Constitution**, Article V
* **General Assembly Resolutions:** 12/67 and 13/67

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

* The phrase "any such participation shall be without the right to vote, except in the case of an alternate" may be subject to interpretation regarding whether it applies only to alternates participating on behalf of a representative.
* The conditions for alternates, associates, and advisers' participation in the Council's proceedings are not explicitly stated, potentially leaving room for ambiguity.

**Risks:**

* **Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with FAO regulations or resolutions may result in reputational damage, financial penalties, or diplomatic tensions.
* **Conflicting Interests:** Potential conflicts of interest between member nations and their representatives' actions while participating in the Council's proceedings may arise.
