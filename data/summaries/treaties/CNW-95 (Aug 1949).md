I can help you analyze the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Convention 101, which is the authentic text of the document. Here's a summary of its key provisions:

**Article 21**

* The ILO Director-General will inform members about the application of the convention in various territories.
* Members can modify or renounce previous declarations at any time.

**Article 22**

* A member can denounce the convention after 10 years from its entry into force, with a one-year notice period.
* After the initial 10-year period, denunciations will be made every 10 years, unless a new convention is ratified that modifies or replaces the ILO's Convention.

**Article 23**

* The Director-General will notify all members of ratifications, declarations, and denunciations.

**Article 24**

* The Director-General will report to the United Nations about ratifications, declarations, and denunciations.

**Article 25**

* At the end of each 10-year period, the ILO Governing Body will present a report on the convention's effectiveness.

**Article 26**

* If a new convention is adopted that revises this one, existing members must immediately denounce this Convention unless the new Convention specifies otherwise.
* This Convention will remain in force for those countries that have ratified it but not the revised Convention.

**Article 27**

* Both English and French versions of the text are considered authoritative.

The ILO's Convention 101 was adopted on July 2, 1949.
