**Memorandum: Philippines & European Commission National Indicative Programmes 2002-04 (Revised), 2005-06**

**Date:** August 10, 2004

**Parties:**
*   Government of the Republic of the Philippines ("Philippines")
*   European Commission ("EC")

**Objective:** Outlines objectives and priority fields for co-operation, aligning with the Philippines' Mid-Term Development Plan to support sustainable economic, social, and environmental development.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Areas of Cooperation:** Identifies three priority areas for co-operation:
    1.  Assistance to the poorest sectors (Health Sector Programme, Mindanao Reconstruction - Multi-Donor Trust Fund).
    2.  Assistance to Trade and Investment (Trade Sector Policy/Institutional Reform, Higher Education).
    3.  Good Governance (Access to Justice, Anti-Corruption, Security/Counter-Terrorism).
*   **Indicative Financial Envelope:** Establishes indicative financial allocations of €18 million for 2002-2004 and €45 million for 2005-2006, totaling €63 million for the period. Stipulates that the allocation is "subject to budget availability" and "may be adjusted."

**Obligations:**

*   **Mutual Agreement:** Any modification to the areas of co-operation requires the mutual agreement of both parties.
*   **Implementation:** The Philippines is implicitly obligated to implement programmes and projects consistent with the outlined objectives and priorities.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Memorandum is non-binding, the allocation depends on budget availability. The use of "indicative" financial envelopes and the disclaimer regarding budget availability mitigates potential liability for non-disbursement of funds.
*   **Potential Risk:** The broad nature of "Good Governance" could lead to disagreements on implementation and scope.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Budget Availability":** This clause provides the EC with significant discretion, potentially leading to disputes if funding is reduced or withheld.
*   **"Good Governance as a cross-cutting issue":** This definition is nebulous.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   *Pacta Sunt Servanda* is relevant to the interpretation of the agreement.
*   Reference to the Mid-Term Development Plan of the Philippines should be checked for consistency.
*   The validity and enforceability of this Memorandum would be determined by international law principles and any relevant domestic legislation in the Philippines governing international agreements.

**Potential Risks for Client (Assuming Representation of Philippines):**

*   **Funding Shortfall:** EC's ability to adjust the budget creates uncertainty.
*   **Scope Creep:** The broadly defined "Good Governance" area could expand beyond initial expectations.
*   **Disagreements on Implementation:** Differing interpretations of project objectives could lead to delays or disputes.

**Recommendations:**

*   Seek clarification on the EC's budget availability outlook for the relevant periods.
*   Establish clear, measurable, and achievable objectives for each area of cooperation.
*   Establish a dispute resolution mechanism in any subsequent project-specific agreements.
*   Ensure alignment of projects to comply with Philippine Laws
