## Summary of Memorandum of Agreement on Rice Trade (Philippines-Cambodia, 2013-2015)

**Overview:** This Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) outlines an agreement between the Philippines (GPH) and Cambodia (RGC) for the sale and purchase of white rice from 2013 to 2015. It aims to improve bilateral trade and ensure Philippine food security.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1:** RGC agrees to sell, and GPH agrees to buy, white rice at mutually agreed annual amounts based on prevailing international prices, except in cases of natural disasters and harvest loss. This provision establishes a *best efforts* obligation, with the natural disaster exemption potentially contentious due to its subjective interpretation.
*   **Article 2:** Designates the Green Trade Company (GTC) and a Cambodian rice export entity (approved by Ministry of Commerce of Cambodia with consent of buyer) and the National Food Authority (NFA) as the implementing State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) on the Cambodian and Philippine sides, respectively. The use of SOEs raises issues of governmental liability and potential conflicts with WTO rules regarding state trading enterprises (e.g., *United States - Tax Treatment for 'Foreign Sales Corporations'*).
*   **Article 3:** Requires all Sale/Purchase Contracts to be based on international trade practices, rules, and regulations. It also mandates negotiations towards mutually agreed upon terms and conditions in sale/purchase contracts. Lack of specific details opens the door for disputes regarding acceptable international trade practices (referring to Incoterms, UCP 600, etc.).
*   **Article 4:** Commits both parties to cooperate in stopping illegal rice trading, indicating concerns about smuggling or other illicit activities impacting trade.
*   **Article 5:** Allows for amendments through written proposals with a 60-day response period via diplomatic channels and requires amicable settlement of disputes through consultation and negotiation. The absence of a specific dispute resolution mechanism (arbitration, litigation) beyond "amicable settlement" presents a significant risk.
*   **Article 6:** Sets the MOA's term from the date of signing (April 4, 2013) to December 31, 2015, with a six-month prior written notice requirement for termination. Termination does not affect ongoing contracts, unless otherwise agreed.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **RGC:** Obligation to sell rice, subject to force majeure (natural disasters & harvest loss). Potential liability if failing to deliver without justifiable cause.
*   **GPH:** Obligation to purchase rice, depending on needs. Potential liability for breach of contract if failing to purchase agreed-upon quantities.
*   **Both:** Good faith negotiation of contracts, cooperation in combating illegal trade.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity:** The term "prevailing international price" is undefined, potentially leading to price disputes. The interpretation of "depending on its needs" is also vague and could allow the Philippines to avoid purchases.
*   **Enforcement:** The MOA relies heavily on "amicable settlement," lacking a clear dispute resolution mechanism. This makes enforcement difficult and costly.
*   **State Liability:** Actions of GTC, the Cambodian export entity, and NFA could create liability for the respective governments. Sovereign immunity may or may not apply.
*   **WTO Compliance:** The MOA's structure, particularly the involvement of SOEs, needs scrutiny for compliance with WTO rules and non-discrimination principles.
*   **Force Majeure:** The “natural disasters and harvest loss” exemption could be invoked opportunistically, disrupting trade.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Philippine Government Procurement Reform Act (RA 9184): Need to ensure any procurement under this MOA complies with this Act.
*   Philippine Civil Code provisions on contracts (Articles 1156 onwards): Govern interpretation and enforcement of the MOA and subsequent contracts.
*   Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (if considered a treaty under Philippine law): Guides interpretation of the MOA.
*   WTO Agreements, particularly the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the Agreement on Agriculture: Ensure compliance regarding trade restrictions, subsidies, and state trading enterprises. Cases like *Canada – Measures Affecting the Export of Civilian Aircraft* and *United States - Tax Treatment for 'Foreign Sales Corporations'* are relevant.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   Article 1's "depending on its needs" clause.
*   Article 5's lack of a specific dispute resolution mechanism.
