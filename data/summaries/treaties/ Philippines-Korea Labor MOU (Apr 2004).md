## Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Summary: DOLE (Philippines) & MOL (South Korea) - Sending Workers to South Korea

**Document:** Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Department of Labor and Employment of the Philippines (DOLE) and the Ministry of Labor of the Republic of Korea (MOL) on Sending Workers to the Republic of Korea (April 23, 2004)

**Purpose:** Establishes a framework for cooperation and transparency in sending Filipino workers to South Korea under the Employment Permit System for Foreign Workers (EPS) pursuant to the *Act on Foreign Workers' Employment, etc.* of South Korea (Foreigner Employment Act).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sending Agency:** DOLE (specifically, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) acting on DOLE's behalf) is the primary Philippine government agency for recruitment, selection, and sending. POEA is authorized to collect expenses equivalent to actual expense incurred in the process of recruitment, selection, and deployment of workers. Amount of expenses and calculation method will be agreed upon by DOLE and MOL.
*   **Recruitment and Selection:** DOLE/POEA is obligated to select job-seekers based on criteria like age (18-40), Korean Language Proficiency (after August 17, 2005), health examination, no criminal record punishable by imprisonment, and no travel restrictions. A roster of qualified job-seekers must be prepared and submitted to the MOL. The MOL can reject candidates for errors, fraud, or misrepresentation, and impose sanctions as per Korean law.
*   **Labor Contract:** DOLE/POEA is obligated to explain the labor contract (draft) to workers, provide copies, and instruct them to carry it. Standard form contract mandated by MOL. The DOLE/POEA will also conduct training to workers on the roster of job-seekers, the contents and period of the training will be determined through consultation between the Ministries.
*   **Entry & Management:** The DOLE/MOL must ensure workers enter South Korea on schedule. Workers must carry copies of their labor contract and health examination certificates. The MOL will conduct training and health examinations to a worker before he/she is allocated to a workplace. If the health of the worker is unsuitable, the MOL may restrict his/her employment and take proper measures. The sending agency will pay for a return trip of such workers concerned. Workers are allowed to work up to 3 years, with contract periods not exceeding 1 year. Workplace changes are generally restricted. Workers must comply with all Korean laws, including the Foreigner Employment Act and the *Immigration Control Act*. The POEA is obligated to actively ensure worker compliance with Korean law, prevent illegal stay/absconding, and ensure voluntary departure upon expiry of employment period.
*   **Computer Infrastructure:** DOLE/POEA obligated to build a computer infrastructure in consultation with the MOL to facilitate the sending of the roster of job-seekers and other related actions, to help in the signing of labor contracts between workers and employers, and protect the personal information of workers and employers.
*   **Korean Language Proficiency Test:** The DOLE/MOL are obligated to administer the Korean Language Proficiency Test.
*   **Illegal Residents:** Former Philippine illegal residents who voluntarily departed from Korea before March 2004 receive preferential treatment in selection. The DOLE and MOL will also make active efforts to ensure the departure of workers illegally residing in Korea and to prevent future workers from staying illegal.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Breach of Contract:** Failure of DOLE/POEA to fulfill obligations related to recruitment, selection, training, or ensuring worker compliance could lead to disputes with the MOL and potential termination of the MOU.
*   **Worker Non-Compliance:** High rates of absconding or illegal stay by Filipino workers in South Korea could trigger the MOU's termination clause. The DOLE/POEA bears responsibility for mitigating this risk.
*   **Misrepresentation/Fraud:** Liability arises if the DOLE/POEA submits inaccurate information or participates in fraudulent activities related to worker selection or recruitment. The MOL may impose sanctions to a worker for any fraudulent act or false statement.
*   **Discrimination Claims:** If the selection process is deemed discriminatory or inconsistent with Korean law or international standards, the DOLE/POEA could face legal challenges.
*   **Unclear Definition of "Actual Expenses":** The lack of a concrete definition of "actual expenses" that the POEA can charge workers for recruitment and deployment process could result in exploitation.
*   **No mention of Liability for Accidents and Injuries:** MOU lacks clear allocation of liability for accidents and injuries occurring in the workplace.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Philippine Law Mandating POEA's role in overseas employment regulation.
*   *Act on Foreign Workers' Employment, etc.* of the Republic of Korea (Foreigner Employment Act).
*   *Immigration Control Act* of the Republic of Korea.

**Ambiguous & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Paragraph 3(2):** "Expenses equivalent to actual expense incurred" - The lack of a specific definition of "actual expenses" creates ambiguity and the potential for excessive fees charged to workers.
*   **Paragraph 5(3):** "Prescribed training for workers" - The lack of detail regarding the content and period of training could result in inadequate preparation of workers for the conditions of employment in South Korea.
*   **Paragraph 7(5):** "Active efforts to ensure that workers comply with the laws and regulations of the Republic of Korea and the workplace" - This is overly broad and could be interpreted to impose unreasonable burdens on the POEA.

**Note:** This MOU is a framework agreement. Subsequent implementing rules and regulations (IRRs) or annexes referenced within the document (e.g., details regarding Korean Language Proficiency Test, preferential treatment for voluntary leavers) would provide further clarification on specific procedures and obligations. These need to be reviewed to fully assess legal risks.
