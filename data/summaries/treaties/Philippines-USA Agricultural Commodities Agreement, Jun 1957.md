## Summary of Agricultural Commodities Agreement (Philippines-USA, 1957)

**Nature:** This is an agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America, signed June 25, 1957, under Title I of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act (ATDAA), as amended. It governs the sale of surplus US agricultural commodities to the Philippines in exchange for Philippine pesos.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I (Sales for Philippine Pesos):** The US agrees to finance the sale of specific surplus commodities (rice, cotton, dairy, meat, tallow, beans) to the Philippines, up to $10.3 million (including ocean transport), via purchase authorizations issued by the US and accepted by the Philippines by July 31, 1957. These authorizations dictate the terms of sale, delivery, and deposit of Philippine pesos.
*   **Article II (Uses of Philippine Pesos):** Specifies how the US will use the accumulated Philippine pesos:
    *   $3 million equivalent for market development, educational exchange, and US expenditures in the Philippines (under ATDAA subsections 104(a), 104(f), and 104(h)).
    *   $2.1 million equivalent for common defense purposes (under ATDAA subsection 104(c)), subject to a supplemental agreement.
    *   $5.2 million equivalent for loans to the Philippines for economic development (under ATDAA section 104(g)), subject to a supplemental agreement. This includes relending to private enterprise through established banking facilities. The loan is denominated in dollars and payable in dollars or pesos.
    *   Adjustments to loan amounts based on the total peso deposits.
*   **Article III (Deposit of Philippine Pesos):** Requires peso deposits to be made at the exchange rate applicable to import transactions (excluding preferential rates) on the dates of dollar disbursement by US banks or the US government.
*   **Article IV (General Undertakings):**
    *   The Philippines agrees to prevent resale/transshipment of commodities to other countries or use for non-domestic purposes without US approval and to prevent increased availability to unfriendly nations.
    *   Both governments agree to take precautions against disrupting world prices or impairing trade relations.
    *   Both governments will seek to develop and expand continuous market demand for agricultural commodities, creating an environment where private traders can effectively operate.
    *   The Philippines will furnish information on the program's progress, including commodity arrivals, conditions, maintenance of usual marketings, and export information.
*   **Article V (Consultation):** Obligation for both governments to consult on any matter relating to the application of the agreement.

**Obligations:**

*   **USA:**
    *   Financing the sale of agreed-upon surplus agricultural commodities.
    *   Issuing and accepting purchase authorizations.
    *   Using Philippine pesos for agreed-upon purposes according to the Act and any supplemental agreements.
*   **Philippines:**
    *   Authorizing purchasers.
    *   Preventing resale/transshipment/non-domestic use without approval and avoiding increased availability to unfriendly nations.
    *   Depositing Philippine pesos at the specified exchange rate.
    *   Furnishing information on program progress.

**Liabilities:**

*   The agreement itself doesn't explicitly define financial penalties for breach.
*   Failure of the Philippines to prevent resale or use by unfriendly nations could create diplomatic and potentially legal issues under US export control laws or the ATDAA.
*   Delays in advancing the loans if the parties cannot reach agreements could lead to the US using the pesos for other allowable purposes.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Supplemental Agreements:** The agreement relies heavily on future "supplemental agreements," particularly regarding common defense and economic development loans. Failure to reach these agreements introduces uncertainty.
*   **"Usual Marketing" and "Unduly Disrupt World Prices":** These phrases lack precise definitions and could lead to disputes. Case law under similar trade agreements might provide some interpretive guidance, but specific context is crucial.
*   **Section 104 of ATDAA:** The agreement repeatedly references Section 104 of the ATDAA. A thorough understanding of this section is crucial. Consider researching legal cases that interpret the provisions in cases of ambiguity.
*   **Exchange Rate Fluctuations:** The agreement specifies the exchange rate at the time of dollar disbursement. However, significant fluctuations between disbursement and peso deposit could lead to discrepancies.
*   **Market Manipulation:** The provisions regarding preventing disruption to world prices is hard to enforce and is prone to potential market manipulation by external forces.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (ATDAA), as amended, Title I, Sections 104(a), 104(c), 104(f), 104(g), and 104(h):** The ATDAA is the fundamental statute authorizing the agreement.
*   While I am unaware of any cases citing *this specific* 1957 agreement, research into litigation involving the ATDAA or similar international commodity agreements is advisable for interpreting ambiguous clauses. Focus on cases addressing "usual marketing," "undue disruption," and permissible uses of foreign currency generated under such agreements.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The clauses related to ensuring usual marketing.
*   The absence of specific enforcement mechanisms.
*   Reliance on future supplemental agreements.
