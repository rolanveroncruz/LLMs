* **Lack of Transparency:** The amendment's unclear sub-paragraph references (e.g., A.1 â€” A.3) may lead to confusion and disputes among member states.

### Relevant Case Law:

* None specifically mentioned in this document, but relevant cases on international cooperation, representation, and liability in the context of nuclear energy may be applicable.

### Statutory References:

* The International Atomic Energy Agency Act (IAEA)
* The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)

### Ambiguous or Contingent Clauses:

* Article A.1(a)(b) and (c): The unclear designation of "one further member" from each region may lead to disputes among member states.
* Paragraph D: The removal of the second sentence may have unintended consequences, such as affecting the overall effectiveness of the amendment.

**Recommendation:** 

This amendment requires careful consideration of its implications on international cooperation, representation, and liability. Member states should carefully review their obligations and potential risks before implementing this change.
