2.  **Dividends**: The new paragraph 2 deletes existing Article 10(2) and introduces a 15% tax cap for dividends taxed in the Contracting State of the recipient's residence.
3.  **Interest**: A similar amendment is introduced for interest, with a 10% tax cap for taxes levied on income arising in the Contracting State.
4.  **Royalties**: A new Article IV introduces a royalty definition and allows royalties to be taxed in the source state (New Zealand) at a maximum rate of 15%.
    *   Relevant Case Law: None directly applicable
5.  **Relief from Double Taxation**: The amendment introduces a New Zealand provision allowing Philippine tax paid on income derived in the Philippines to be credited against New Zealand tax.
