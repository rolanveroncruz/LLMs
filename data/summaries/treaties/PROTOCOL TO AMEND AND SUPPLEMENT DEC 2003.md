**Protocol to Amend and Supplement Air Services Agreement between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain**

**Summary for Lawyers**

### Key Provisions

* **Article 1**: Amends references from "State of Bahrain" to "Kingdom of Bahrain".
* **Article 2**: Replaces Article 1(b) with new definition of "Aeronautical Authorities", specifying Ministry of Transportation (Kingdom of Bahrain) and Civil Aeronautics Board (Republic of the Philippines).
* **Article 3**: Modifies Paragraph (1) of Article 3, allowing each Contracting Party to designate one or more airlines for operating agreed services on specified routes.

### Obligations

* The Protocol comes into provisional force upon signature and definitively on exchange of Diplomatic Notes confirming constitutional requirements have been fulfilled.
* Each Contracting Party is required to notify the other party of designations made under Article 3.

### Liabilities

* **Ambiguous Clause**: No specific provisions address liability in case of non-performance or breach. (Potential risk: disputes may arise from unclear expectations or obligations.)

### Relevant Case Law

* None directly applicable, but relevant case law on international air services agreements and treaty interpretation may be relevant in interpreting the Protocol's intent.

### Statutory References

* None explicitly referenced; however, relevant laws and regulations governing air services and treaties will likely apply.

### Potential Risks

* **Ambiguous Clause**: As mentioned above, potential disputes may arise from unclear expectations or obligations.
* **Lack of Specificity**: No provisions address specific scenarios such as route changes, airline designations, or service disruptions. (Potential risk: courts may interpret ambiguous clauses differently.)

**Recommendation**

Lawyers should review the Protocol carefully to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing air services agreements. The ambiguous Clause in Article 4 warrants attention, and consideration of potential disputes arising from unclear expectations or obligations is advised.
