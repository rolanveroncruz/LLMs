I'll extract the relevant information about the arrangement of Australian and Philippine authorities for military exercises in the Philippines. Here are 3 key points:

**a. Re-exportation of goods**: The Philippines authorities allow re-exportation of certain goods exclusively for use by members of the Australian force, provided they meet administrative requirements.

**b. Transfer of personnel**: Members of the Australian force must obtain approval from Philippine authorities before transferring to another person or organization.

**c. Delivery and usage of fuel, oil, and lubricants**: The Australian authorities are allowed to deliver fuel, oil, and lubricants exclusively for use by aircraft of the Australian force, without duties or taxes.
