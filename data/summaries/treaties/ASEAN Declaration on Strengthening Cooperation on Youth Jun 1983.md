*   Member countries are expected to create environments that promote creativity and responsibility among youth.

### **Liabilities**

*   Failure to comply with the Declaration may result in reputational damage and loss of international credibility for non-compliant member states.
*   The Declaration emphasizes the importance of cooperation and collective action, suggesting that member states have a shared responsibility to implement these principles.

### **Potential Risks**

*   Ambiguity surrounding the definition of "youth" and "youth organizations," which may lead to differing interpretations and conflicting actions among member states.
*   Limited resources and capacity constraints in some member states, which may hinder their ability to fully implement the Declaration's provisions.
*   The risk of unequal distribution of benefits and opportunities for youth across member states, potentially exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.
