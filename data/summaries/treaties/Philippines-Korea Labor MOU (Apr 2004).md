## Legal Summary of DOLE-MOL MOU (April 23, 2004)

**Document:** Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Department of Labor and Employment of the Philippines (DOLE) and the Ministry of Labor of the Republic of Korea (MOL) on sending Philippine workers to the Republic of Korea.

**Purpose:** To establish a framework for cooperation and transparency in the sending of Philippine workers to Korea under the Korean Employment Permit System for Foreign Workers (based on the "Foreigner Employment Act" of Korea).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Sending Agency:** DOLE, acting through the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), is the primary sending agency, responsible for recruiting, selecting, and sending workers. This arrangement acknowledges POEA's regulatory mandate under Philippine law for overseas employment.
*   **Recruitment & Selection:** Outlines specific criteria for selecting job-seekers, including age (18-40), Korean language proficiency (after August 17, 2005), health examination, no criminal record involving imprisonment, and no travel restrictions. Selection methods are subject to agreement between DOLE and MOL. The Korean Language Proficiency Test is a key component, with its administration and criteria determined solely by the MOL.
*   **Labor Contract:** Requires the use of a standard MOL labor contract form. The sending agency has the responsibility to explain the contract contents to workers and provide copies. Prescribed training for workers is also mandated, with content and duration determined via consultations between the Ministries.
*   **Entry & Employment Management:** Workers allowed to work in Korea for up to three years, with contract periods not exceeding one year. Workplace changes are restricted and subject to MOL approval. Workers must comply with Korean laws, including the Foreigner Employment Act and Immigration Control Act.
*   **Computer Infrastructure:** Establishment of a computer system to facilitate sending rosters and labor contracts.
*   **Illegal Residents:** Preferential treatment for voluntary leavers (Philippine illegal residents who departed Korea by the end of February 2004). DOLE and MOL agree to make effort to eliminate illegal stay of workers.
*   **General Provisions:** Cooperation between labor attaches, reciprocal assessment visits, possibility of annexes, and dispute resolution through consultation.

**Obligations:**

*   **DOLE/POEA:** Recruit, select, and send qualified workers; ensure workers understand labor contracts; conduct training; ensure compliance with Korean laws; prevent illegal stay and ensure voluntary departure.
*   **MOL:** Set employment conditions, administer health examinations, determine total number of workers needed, provide the Labor Contract Form, and train workers before workplace allocation.
*   **Workers:** Comply with Korean laws and the terms of their employment contracts.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Sending Agency (POEA):** Responsible for expenses incurred in job application, selection, and sending of workers. Must pay for return trip of workers who are deemed unsuitable to work in Korea.
*   **Workers:** Subject to Korean laws, including immigration laws. Failure to comply can lead to deportation and other penalties.
*   **Potential Liability:** The MOU itself doesn't explicitly assign liability for breaches. However, general principles of international law and contract law may apply. For example, if POEA fails to adequately vet workers and a high percentage become illegal residents, MOL could arguably claim a breach of the MOU, triggering termination.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Unilateral Termination Clause:** Paragraph 13(2) allows MOL to unilaterally terminate the MOU if the ratio of illegally residing workers exceeds a "certain limit" or irregularities occur in the sending process. This is a significant risk, as the "certain limit" is not defined, giving MOL broad discretion.
*   **Lack of Enforcement Mechanism:** The MOU does not specify a concrete enforcement mechanism for breaches of the agreement. Disputes are to be resolved through consultation, which may not be sufficient.
*   **Vague Language:** Several provisions use vague language, such as "active efforts" and "suitable". This can lead to disputes over interpretation and implementation.
*   **Korean Language Proficiency Test:** The test's administration, content, and influence on selection are determined *solely* by the MOL, giving the Philippines limited control over this key selection criterion.
*   **Liability for Actions of Workers:** The MOU obligates the sending agency to prevent workerâ€™s unauthorized leave and illegal residency. However, this is a difficult task, and the MOU does not specify the potential consequences if the sending agency fails in this obligation.
*   **Governing Law:** The MOU is silent on governing law, creating potential uncertainty in the event of a dispute. Principles of *pacta sunt servanda* likely apply, but specific legal interpretations could differ.

**Statutory References & Case Law (Potential):**

*   **Philippine Law:** Relevant Philippine laws include the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995 (R.A. 8042, as amended), which governs the recruitment and deployment of Filipino workers overseas. Case law interpreting this Act could be relevant.
*   **Korean Law:** The Foreigner Employment Act of Korea is central to the MOU. Korean case law interpreting this act would be relevant. The Immigration Control Act of Korea could be relevant as well.
*   **International Law:** Principles of treaty interpretation and international cooperation would apply.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   Paragraph 13(2) - The unilateral termination clause, due to the undefined "certain limit" and broad grounds for termination.
*   Paragraph 9(2) - MOL's sole discretion in determining the Korean Language Proficiency Test details.

**Recommendations for Attorney Review:**

*   Clarification of the "certain limit" for illegal residency that triggers termination.
*   Negotiation of a more robust dispute resolution mechanism.
*   Strengthening of language regarding Philippine input into the Korean Language Proficiency Test.
*   Inclusion of language clarifying liability for actions of workers and consequences of failing to prevent illegal residency.
*   Consideration of a governing law clause.
