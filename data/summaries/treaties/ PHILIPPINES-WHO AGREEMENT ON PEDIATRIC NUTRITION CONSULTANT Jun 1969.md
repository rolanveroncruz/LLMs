**Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the World Health Organization Concerning a Request for Consultant in the Field of Pediatric Nutrition**

### Key Provisions:

* The World Health Organization (WHO) agrees to provide a consultant in pediatric nutrition for three months in 1970.
* The terms of reference include:
	+ Advising on malnutrition wards, practical nutrition teaching, and community follow-up.
	+ Assisting with a short course for physicians in pediatric nutrition.
	+ Advising on methodology for nutrition research.
* The Basic Agreement between the Philippines and WHO (1950) governs the implementation of this request and the respective obligations of WHO and the Government.

### Obligations:

* The Government is required to provide:
	+ Transport within the country
	+ Secretarial services, if required
	+ Insurance for civil liability under the laws of the country for WHO's advisers, agents, employees, and vehicles.
* The consultant must provide expert advice and assistance on pediatric nutrition.

### Liabilities:

* The Government is liable for any damage or injury caused to individuals or property during the provision of services by WHO's advisers, agents, employees, or contractors.
* The Government is also responsible for ensuring that all necessary documentation and support are provided to the consultant.

### Potential Risks:

* **Ambiguous Clauses:**
	+ The provision of insurance for civil liability may not provide adequate coverage, potentially leaving the Government liable in the event of an accident or injury.
	+ The exact scope of the consultant's responsibilities is unclear, which may lead to disputes over their duties and obligations.
* **Relevant Case Law:**
	+ There are no specific case law references provided in this document. However, relevant cases on liability and insurance for international organizations, such as the WHO, would be relevant to understanding the Government's potential liabilities.

### Statutory References:

* Basic Agreement between the Philippines and WHO (1950)
* Relevant local laws and regulations governing liability, insurance, and international cooperation with organizations like WHO.

**Recommendations:**

* Ensure that the Government has adequate insurance coverage for civil liability in respect of any damage or injury caused during the provision of services by WHO's advisers, agents, employees, or contractors.
* Clearly define the scope of the consultant's responsibilities to avoid disputes over their duties and obligations.
* Consult with relevant local laws and regulations governing international cooperation with organizations like WHO to ensure compliance with applicable requirements.
