## Summary of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) - Philippines & Australia (1989)

**Document:** Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of Australia relating to the Natural Resources Management and Development Project (NRMDP), dated January 25, 1989.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Purpose:** Establishes cooperation for the NRMDP, aiming for improved natural resource management and land utilization in the Philippines. Two themes: strengthen the capacity of the Philippines to plan and implement natural resources development and land administration programs and completion of a primary geodetic control network for the Philippines.
*   **Executing Authorities:** DENR (Philippines) and AIDAB (Australia). AIDAB may nominate agents.
*   **Philippines' Responsibilities:** Co-ordination with NEDA, NLTDRA, Bureau of Local Government Finance, and DAR. Final responsibility for project execution conforming to sound administrative and technical practices (Clause 3.3). Providing for taxes accruing to the project (clause 5.2)
*   **Duration:** Effective from signature, ceasing Australian contribution on March 31, 1993 (or later agreed date).
*   **Contributions:** Estimated at â‚±60.23 million (Philippines) and A$19.4 million (Australia), subject to parliamentary/congressional approval.
*   **Personnel:** Australian personnel (excluding Philippine nationals employed as consultants) are to have advisory/consultant roles. The Australian Team Leader has administrative control over Australian-funded personnel, subject to Philippine laws. The Philippines provides tax and duty exemptions (income, imports) to Australian personnel (excluding Philippine nationals employed as consultants) and their dependents (clause 6.4).
*   **Implementation:** Requires work plans, budgets, and an Implementation Document with forward work program and progress indicators (clauses 7.1 and 7.2). Regular joint field monitoring and potential major reviews by joint investigation teams (clauses 7.3 and 7.4).
*   **Supplies:** Philippines to exempt (or pay) import duties/taxes on Australian-supplied goods for the Project, including those sourced locally by AIDAB's agents. Includes facilitating customs clearance. Project supplies are for unrestricted project use and under Australian Team Leader's administrative control (clauses 8.1-8.3). Vehicle ownership/control is defined.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Clause 9 (Claims):** The Philippines *indemnifies* Australian personnel and firms from civil liability for acts/omissions during project execution, **except** for *gross negligence or willful misconduct*.  This indemnity clause needs careful scrutiny.  What constitutes "gross negligence" is often litigated and is fact-dependent.  Consider defining "gross negligence" within the context of the project to avoid future disputes. **Relevant Case Law:** *Republic v. Purisima*, G.R. No. L-36084, June 29, 1987, which discusses state immunity but also highlights potential government liability for tortious acts of its agents.
*   **Clause 10 (Security):** Philippines to provide security for Australian personnel and property. Vague as to the extent and nature of security.  Clarify the security arrangements to avoid future disputes regarding adequacy of protection.
*   **Limited Duration:** The agreement is finite.  Consider contingency plans for project continuation or transition beyond 1993.
*   **Funding Approval:**  Disbursements are subject to annual budgetary approval, creating a potential risk of funding shortfalls.
*   **Ambiguity:** Annexes are critical (clause 12), yet not included. Their absence makes a complete risk assessment impossible.
*   **Transfer of Title:** the transfer of title of the motor vehicles after the end of the project should be reviewed as this can cause issues during the implementation of the project.

**Statutory References:**

*   Implicit references to Philippine tax laws (income tax, import duties, VAT) are present, specifically in clauses 6.4 and 8.1. This is crucial in understanding which tax laws were in force at the time of the execution of the MOU.
*   Reference to customs laws and administrative procedures.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Natural Resources Management and Development Project":** Described vaguely in Clause 1.1 and Annex I.  Lack of specific definition could lead to disagreements about the scope of the project.
*   **Clause 9 (Claims):** The "gross negligence or willful misconduct" exception to the indemnity is a potential source of dispute.
*   **Security Arrangements (Clause 10):** Lack of specificity makes enforcement difficult.

**Recommendations:**

*   Review and obtain copies of all annexes referenced in the MOU.
*   Clarify the definition of "gross negligence" in Clause 9.
*   Formalize and specify security arrangements under Clause 10.
*   Assess the legal framework applicable to taxation and customs duties at the time of the MOU's execution and any subsequent amendments.
*   Consider amending the MOU to address the limitations of duration and funding approval contingencies.
*   Assess title of the motor vehicles for compliance with the vehicle laws of the Republic of the Philippines.
