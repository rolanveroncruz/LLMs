This is a diplomatic note exchanged between the Government of the Philippines and the United States, specifically the Embassy of the United States in Manila. The note proposes amendments to the Agricultural Commodities Agreement signed on May 4, 1972.

The agreement includes several key provisions:

1. **Commodity Table**: Rice is added as a commodity with a total maximum export value of $14,775 thousand.
2. **Payment Terms**:
	* For tobacco, cotton, feedgrains, and fallow: convertible local currency credit with interest rates of 2% for the initial payment and 3% for subsequent payments.
	* For rice, no initial payment is made, but a currency use payment is also not required.
3. **Usual Marketing Table**: Rice is added to the table.
4. **Export Limitations**: The phrase "paddy brown rice" and "milled rice" are specifically mentioned as types of rice that are subject to export limitations.
5. **Economic Development Purposes**: The agreement allows for the use of proceeds from the sale of commodities for self-help measures, economic development, flood relief, and rehabilitation purposes.
6. **Other Provisions**: Additional provisions include the deposit of local currency into a separate account for relief and rehabilitation purposes.

The note proposes these amendments to the original May 4, 1972 agreement, which remains in force unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties.

This diplomatic exchange is an example of how international agreements can be modified or updated through negotiation between governments.
