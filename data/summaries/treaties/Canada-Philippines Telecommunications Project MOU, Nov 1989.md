## Memorandum of Understanding Summary: Canada-Philippines Telecommunications Project (1989)

**Document:** Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the Telecommunications Import Support Project (Project Number: 734/14576), signed November 7, 1989.

**Purpose:** To record an understanding concerning a Canadian development assistance project aimed at contributing to the economic growth and regional development of the Philippines by assisting in acquiring telecommunications technology from Canada.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Nature of Arrangement (Article I):** Establishes the MOU as an arrangement under the General Agreement on Development Cooperation between Canada and the Philippines (1987).
*   **Responsible Authorities (Article II):** Designates CIDA (Canadian International Development Agency) for Canada and DOTC (Department of Transportation and Communications) for the Philippines.
*   **Project Description (Article III):** Defines the project's purpose, aiming to acquire telecommunications technology from Canada to foster economic growth and regional development in the Philippines. Detailed description provided in Annex "A" (not provided).
*   **Canadian Contribution (Article IV):** Canada provides a contribution not exceeding Cdn $15,000,000. Prohibits the use of the contribution for taxes, customs duties, or other levies imposed by the Philippines.
*   **Philippine Contribution (Article V):** The Philippines is responsible for providing all resources required to implement the MOU and the Project, subject to its budgetary processes. Responsibilities of the Philippine Executing Agency are detailed in Annex "B" (not provided).
*   **Use of Contribution (Article VI):** The Canadian contribution will finance 35% of each transaction described in Annex A, in parallel with the line of credit from the Export Development Corporation of Canada (EDC). Procurement procedures are outlined in Annex "C" (not provided). Requires a minimum of 60% Canadian content for goods, equipment, and services purchased.
*   **Cancellation and Suspension (Article VII):** Canada may suspend the contribution if the Philippines fails to meet its obligations or if the EDC financing is suspended or cancelled. Any uncommitted funds after two years from the signing or the effective date of the EDC Line of Credit Agreement will be cancelled, unless otherwise agreed.
*   **General Undertaking (Article VIII):** Requires due diligence and efficiency in carrying out the project. Mandates cooperation and information sharing. Allows Canadian representatives to visit project sites.
*   **Communications (Article IX):** Specifies communication methods and addresses for each party. All communication must be in writing and deemed delivered upon hand delivery, mail, or electronic communication.

**Obligations:**

*   **Canada:** To provide the financial contribution as outlined, monitor and evaluate the project, and cooperate with the Philippines in the project's implementation.
*   **Philippines:** To provide necessary resources, manage the project effectively through the DOTC, comply with procurement procedures and Canadian content requirements, and inform Canada of any issues hindering the project's progress.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Potential Liability for Non-Compliance:** Both parties could be liable for failing to meet their obligations under the MOU. Canada could suspend or cancel the contribution, and the Philippines may face legal or financial repercussions for mismanaging funds or failing to adhere to procurement guidelines.
*   **Breach of Contract:** Failure to fulfill the obligations stipulated under the MOU could give rise to a breach of contract claim, potentially leading to legal action.
*   **Philippine Taxes:** While the Canadian contribution cannot be used to pay Philippine taxes, the MOU does not explicitly address the liability for taxes that might arise from activities unrelated to the direct use of the contribution.
*   **Indemnity:** The MOU lacks a clear indemnity clause. This could become problematic if liabilities arise from third-party actions or omissions.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Dependency on EDC Financing:** The project's success is contingent on the EDC's continued financing. Suspension or cancellation of the EDC line of credit automatically allows Canada to suspend or cancel its contribution (Article VII(b)).
*   **Budgetary Constraints:** The Philippines' contribution is subject to its "normal budgetary process," which creates uncertainty and potential risk if funding is insufficient.
*   **Procurement Disputes:**  Detailed procurement procedures are in Annex C, which is not provided. Disputes could arise if these procedures are ambiguous or not followed correctly.
*   **Ambiguity of Annexes:** The crucial details of the project, including the specific goods and services to be acquired (Annex A), the responsibilities of the executing agency (Annex B), and the procurement procedures (Annex C), are not included in this document. This lack of detail introduces ambiguity and potential for disputes.
*   **Expiration:** The MOU expires on March 31, 1996 (Article XIII). Any ongoing activities beyond this date may be subject to dispute.

**Case Law & Statutory Considerations:**

*   **General Agreement on Development Cooperation (1987):** The MOU is explicitly linked to this agreement, meaning that any interpretation or dispute would likely reference this foundational document.
*   **Philippine Procurement Laws:** The procurement of goods and services will likely be governed by Philippine procurement laws and regulations, which could impact compliance with Annex C.
*   **Canadian International Development Assistance Act (if applicable):**  Any relevant Canadian legislation governing CIDA's activities and development assistance policies.
*   **Interpretation of International Agreements:** Principles of international law regarding treaty interpretation would be applicable to resolving any disputes arising under the MOU.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Section 5.01 (Philippine Contribution):**  The phrase "subject to its normal budgetary process" creates uncertainty about the level and reliability of the Philippines' contribution.
*   **Lack of Specificity in Annexes:** The absence of Annexes A, B, and C makes it impossible to fully assess the specific obligations, potential liabilities, and risks associated with the project.

**Recommendations:**

*   Obtain and review Annexes A, B, and C to fully understand the project scope, obligations, and procurement procedures.
*   Clarify the meaning of "normal budgetary process" to ensure the Philippines' commitment.
*   Consider potential scenarios where EDC financing is impacted and develop contingency plans.
*   Address the lack of an explicit indemnity clause to mitigate potential liabilities arising from third-party actions.
*   Consider extending the MOU beyond the initial expiry date if the project remains ongoing.
