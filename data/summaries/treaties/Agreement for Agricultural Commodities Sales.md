	* The dollar amount disbursed by the Government of the exporting country (excluding ocean transportation costs)
	* Ocean transportation costs financed by the Government of the exporting country
3. **Interest**: Interest on the unpaid balance of the principal due to the Government of the exporting country begins on the date of dollar disbursement and is paid annually.
4. **Payment schedule**: The first installment payment shall be due one year after the date of last delivery of commodities, with subsequent payments due at intervals of one year thereafter.
5. **Interest rate**: Interest rates are specified in Part II of the agreement and apply to both the principal and interest.
