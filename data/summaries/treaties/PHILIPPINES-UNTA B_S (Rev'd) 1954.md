This is a sample diplomatic correspondence between the United Nations and the Government of the Philippines, specifically regarding the signing of a Revised Standard Agreement for Technical Assistance. The correspondence appears to be related to a technical assistance program, and the agreement covers various aspects such as local costs provisions.

The letters exchanged between H.G. Keith (United Nations) and Filemon C. Rodriguez (Chairman, United Nations Technical Assistance Board in the Philippines) provide clarification on certain provisions of the agreement, including:

1. Article I, paragraph 6: Clarification that "third party claims or liability" shall not include claims arising from wilful or reckless acts by experts, agents, or employees of the Organizations.
2. Local costs provision (Article IV, paragraph 2): Explanation that existing arrangements already negotiated with the Government will be deemed to supplement the provisions of Article IV, paragraph 2.

The correspondence demonstrates the level of cooperation and mutual understanding between the United Nations and the Philippines government in implementing a technical assistance program. The agreements reached through these letters likely facilitated the smooth implementation of the program and ensured that both parties were on the same page regarding specific provisions.
