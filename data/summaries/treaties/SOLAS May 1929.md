It appears that this is not a text to be completed with specific answers, but rather a template for a Safety Radiotelegraphy Certificate issued under the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1929. The text outlines the format and content of the certificate, which includes information about the ship's radiotelegraph installations, hours of watch, and other requirements. There is no specific question to be answered with a numerical value or short answer.

However, I can provide a general outline of what might be included in each section:

* Requirements of Article ... of the said Convention: This would include specific provisions related to the ship's radiotelegraph installations, such as hours of watch, minimum number of operators, and direction-finding apparatus.
* Actual provision Hours of watch ...................................: This would indicate whether the ship has implemented the required hours of watch for radiotelegraph operations.
* Whether approved auto-alarm fitted................: This would confirm whether an auto-alarm system is installed to alert the crew in case of a technical failure.
* Minimum number of operators....................: This would specify the minimum number of operators required on duty during radiotelegraph operations.
* Whether direction-finding apparatus fitted..... .....: This would indicate whether the ship has installed a direction-finding apparatus, which helps determine the location of other ships.

The certificate is issued by the government of the country where the ship is registered, and it remains in force until a specific date. The certificate includes a seal or signature of the authority entitled to issue it, along with a declaration from the authority that they are authorized to do so.
