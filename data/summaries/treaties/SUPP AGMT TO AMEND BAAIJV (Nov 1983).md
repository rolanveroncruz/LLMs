**Supplementary Agreement to Amend the Basic Agreement on ASEAN Industrial Joint Ventures (BAAIJV)**

### Key Provisions

The Supplementary Agreement amends the BAAIJV in several areas:

1.  **Tariff Preferences**: The agreement extends tariff preferences for AIJVs in participating countries for a four-year period, commencing from the actual date of commercial production or 30 months after the AEM approves the inclusion of the product in the final list.
2.  **Non-Participating Countries' Rights**: Non-participating countries waive their rights under Chapter II, Article 8 paragraph 2 of the ASEAN PTA for the four-year period. They may become participating countries at any time and extend the same margin of tariff preference for AIJV products.

### Obligations

The parties are obligated to:

*   Implement the amendments as specified in the Supplementary Agreement.
*   Provide necessary notifications and concurrences for non-participating countries seeking to join the agreement.
*   Ensure that entities producing AIJV products within their countries enjoy the margin of tariff preference for that product.

### Liabilities

The parties may be liable for:

*   Failure to implement the amendments as specified in the Supplementary Agreement.
*   Non-compliance with the agreed-upon tariff preferences and margin of preference.

### Potential Risks

1.  **Disputes over Interpretation**: Ambiguities in the agreement may lead to disputes between parties regarding the interpretation of specific provisions, such as Article III paragraph 3 and 8.
2.  **Non-Compliance with Tariff Preferences**: Failure to implement or comply with the tariff preferences may result in trade disruptions and economic losses for participating countries.
