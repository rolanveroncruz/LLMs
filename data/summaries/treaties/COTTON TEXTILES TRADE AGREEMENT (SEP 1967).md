This is a sample agreement between the United States and the Philippines regarding the export of cotton textiles from the Philippines to the United States. The agreement covers various aspects of trade, including the level of exports, market disruption, and statistical data exchange.

Here's a breakdown of the key points in the agreement:

1. **Consultations**: Both governments agree to enter into consultations on any matter arising in the implementation of the agreement.
2. **Export levels**: The Philippines agrees to limit its exports of cotton textiles to levels specified in the annex, which ranges from 350,000 to 500,000 square yards equivalent per category (Group B and Group C).
3. **Market disruption**: If the Philippines' exports cause or threaten to cause market disruption in the United States, the government may request consultations to reach a mutually satisfactory solution.
4. **Seasonal factors**: The Philippines agrees to space its exports evenly throughout the agreement year, taking into account normal seasonal factors.
5. **Statistical data exchange**: Both governments agree to supply statistical data requested by each other.
