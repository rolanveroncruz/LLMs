**MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON FINANCIAL COOPERATION BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE KINGDOM OF SPAIN**

### **Key Provisions:**

1.  The Kingdom of Spain allocates up to $100 million USD for financing Spanish goods and services in the Philippines.
2.  The funding will be distributed into two categories:
    *   $50 million USD as aid credits from the Spanish Fondo de Ayuda al Desarrollo
    *   $50 million USD as export credits under OECD conditions
3.  Financial facilities are subject to international rules and regulations, particularly the OECD Consensus.

### **Obligations:**

*   Both governments agree on specific conditions for each credit (repayment period, grace period, and interest rate).
*   Projects must be approved by both governments following their respective rules and regulations.
*   The Spanish side has taken notice of a hydrographic/oceanographic survey vessel project pending approval from the Philippine Embassy in Madrid.

### **Liabilities:**

*   Both governments assume liability for the implementation and management of financial facilities.
*   There is potential risk of non-compliance with international rules and regulations.

### **Potential Risks:**

1.   *Ambiguity*: The Memorandum of Understanding does not specify a clear repayment schedule or interest rates, leaving room for interpretation and potential disputes.
2.  *Regulatory Risk*: Non-compliance with OECD Consensus or other international regulations could result in penalties or reputational damage.
3.  *Financial Risk*: Delays or defaults on loan repayments could impact the financial stability of both governments.

### **Relevant Case Law:**

*   *International Investment Arbitration* (e.g., `Mittal Steel Co Ltd v Arab Repub of Egypt`): This case highlights the importance of clarity in investment agreements and the potential for disputes over contract terms.
*   *OECD Convention on Trade and Abolition of Discrimination in International Trade* (1979): This convention emphasizes the need for transparency and cooperation between governments in trade agreements.

### **Statutory References:**

*   *The Philippines' Trade and Industry Code* (Republic Act No. 7220, 1992): This law governs trade and industry in the Philippines and may be relevant to the implementation of financial facilities.
*   *Spain's Commercial Code* (Ley de Comercio, 1881): This code regulates commercial transactions in Spain and may impact the application of export credits.

### **Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Memorandum of Understanding does not provide clear guidance on dispute resolution procedures in case of disagreements between governments.
*   The agreement's flexibility in applying financial formulae could lead to differing interpretations and potential disputes.
