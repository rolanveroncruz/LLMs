**MEMORANDUM OF INTENT: ENERGY SECTOR SUPPORT**

**Summary**

This Memorandum of Intent (MOI) between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GOP) and the Government of the United States of America (USG) aims to further bilateral cooperation in the energy sector. The MOI builds upon existing agreements and outlines key provisions, obligations, liabilities, and potential risks.

**Key Provisions**

1. **Continued Support for Electricity Power Industry Reform Law**: DOE and USAID will support the effective implementation of the new Electricity Power Industry Reform Law, ensuring a fair and open competition in the electricity market.
2. **Promotion of Clean Energy**: DOE and USAID will promote the use of clean energy sources, including renewable energy and natural gas, with technical assistance supporting sustainable renewable energy systems in remote rural areas.
3. **Reduction of Urban Air Pollution**: The parties will encourage stronger stakeholder participation to reduce excessive urban air pollution from vehicle emissions through a comprehensive information and education campaign.

**Obligations**

* USG: Provides an estimated contribution of $8.5 million of grant funds for fiscal years 2002-2004 under the Energy Environment Program.
* GOP: Contributes twenty-five (25%) of the total estimated costs in cash and/or in-kind during the same period.

**Liabilities**

* USAID's obligation to provide grant funds is subject to incremental funding in the Strategic Objective Grant Agreement.
* The MOI does not constitute an unconditional obligation for USAID funds.

**Potential Risks**

* **Ambiguous Clauses**: The agreement's ambiguity regarding the exact allocation of grant funds and USAID's obligations may lead to disputes or misunderstandings.
* **Environmental Compliance**: Failure to comply with environmental regulations and standards may result in liability for non-compliance.

**Relevant Case Law**

* None explicitly applicable; however, cases related to environmental compliance, contract interpretation, and grant fund utilization may be relevant.

**Statutory References**

* [Philippine Electricity Power Industry Reform Law](Chapter 761-A)
* [USG's Energy Environment Program]( Not specified in the document)

**Ambiguous or Contentionous Clauses**

* Clause 4 of the MOI, which states that the provision of grant funds is subject to incremental funding in the Strategic Objective Grant Agreement.
* The lack of clarity on how USAID's obligation to provide grant funds will be fulfilled.

**Conclusion**

This Memorandum of Intent outlines a framework for bilateral cooperation between the GOP and USG in the energy sector. While it provides a clear direction, ambiguous clauses and potential risks related to environmental compliance and grant fund utilization may require careful consideration and monitoring.
