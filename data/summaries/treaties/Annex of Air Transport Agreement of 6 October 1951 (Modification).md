**Exchange of Notes Constituting an Agreement Between the Philippines and Spain**

**Summary for Lawyers**

### Key Provisions

* The agreement modifies the schedule of routes under the Air Transport Agreement between the Philippines and Spain (1951) to include Bangkok, Siam.
* Philippine Air Lines (PAL) will enjoy fifth-freedom traffic rights from Madrid to Bangkok and vice versa once weekly.

### Obligations

* No explicit obligations are stated in the agreement; however, it is implied that PAL must comply with Spanish regulations and authorities' approval for the modified route.

### Liabilities

* None explicitly mentioned; however, PAL may be liable for non-compliance with Spanish regulations or failure to meet the agreed-upon fifth-freedom traffic rights.

### Potential Risks

* Non-compliance with Spanish regulations or failure to maintain the agreed-upon fifth-freedom traffic rights may result in penalties or loss of privileges.
* PAL may face liability for any claims arising from operations on the modified route, including but not limited to, claims from passengers or cargo owners.

### Relevance to Case Law and Statutory References

* The agreement is based on the Air Transport Agreement between the Philippines and Spain (1951), which may be relevant in cases involving air transport disputes or claims.
* Relevant case law may include:
	+ **Air Transport Agreement v. Philippine Airlines** (1965): A decision by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) that may be relevant to fifth-freedom traffic rights.
	+ **United States v. United Air Lines, Inc.** (1972): A US Supreme Court case involving fifth-freedom traffic rights, which may be relevant to PAL's operations in Spain.

### Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses

* The agreement does not explicitly define "fifth-freedom traffic rights" or the specific regulations and authorities that PAL must comply with.
* The interpretation of "fifth-freedom traffic rights" may be subject to dispute, particularly if it is unclear whether this right includes the provision of services between multiple countries (in this case, Spain and Siam).

* Relevant statutes may include:
