## Summary of Legal Documents: Bank of China & Central Bank of the Philippines (Jan 10, 1984)

This summary covers two agreements between the Bank of China (BOC) and the Central Bank of the Philippines (CBP), both dated January 10, 1984: a Deposit Agreement and an Agreement on a Credit Line.

**1. Deposit Agreement:**

*   **Key Provisions:**
    *   BOC deposits US$20,000,000 with the CBP.
    *   Term: Six months from drawdown date.
    *   Drawdown: CBP must draw the entire amount within one month of signing.
    *   Interest: LIBOR + 0.5% (average of Midland, Barclays, and Westminster at 11 AM London time two days prior to drawdown). Interest calculation: 360-day year. Interest payment on maturity.
    *   Repayment: Principal and interest in USD, free of taxes or levies, at maturity.
    *   Governing Law: Unspecified, creating potential conflict of laws issues.
*   **Obligations:**
    *   BOC: To deposit funds per terms.
    *   CBP: To draw funds within the stipulated timeframe, repay principal and interest at maturity, and ensure tax-free repayment.
*   **Liabilities:**
    *   CBP: Liable for repayment of principal and interest per the agreement. Potential liability if failing to draw down within the stipulated timeframe.
    *   BOC: Liable for depositing funds according to the agreement.
*   **Potential Risks:**
    *   Currency fluctuation risk.
    *   Sovereign risk: The CBP's ability to repay could be affected by the Philippines' economic situation.
    *   Absence of a governing law clause. This could lead to disputes over interpretation and enforcement. Potential application of *pacta sunt servanda* (agreements must be kept) under international law may apply, but subject to interpretation.
    *   The vagueness of the "account specified by it in a tested telex to the Bank of China" creates ambiguity that can be abused.

**2. Agreement on a Credit Line:**

*   **Key Provisions:**
    *   BOC extends a US$20,000,000 credit line to the CBP.
    *   Purpose: Financing China's exports to the Philippines via discounting bills of exchange.
    *   Validity: One year from the agreement's effective date.
    *   Tenor: Each advance (discounted bill) must be between 30 and 180 days.
    *   Mechanism: CBP or designated Philippine banks open LCs with usance bills drawn on BOC. BOC accepts and discounts bills upon receipt of shipping documents.
    *   Discount Charges: Interest at LIBOR (same banks/time as Deposit Agreement) plus acceptance commission of 0.5% p.a. payable on negotiation date.
    *   Designated BOC Branches: Beijing (Head Office), Guangzhou, Dalian, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin.
*   **Obligations:**
    *   BOC: To honor LCs and discount bills as per the agreement.
    *   CBP/Opening Bank: To open LCs with usance bills acceptable to BOC, pay discount charges (interest & acceptance commission) and remit payments on maturity.
*   **Liabilities:**
    *   BOC: Liable for honoring conforming documentary presentations under LCs and discounting bills as outlined.
    *   CBP/Opening Bank: Liable for payment of discounted bills at maturity, discount charges, and potential liability for non-conforming presentations or failure to pay.
*   **Potential Risks:**
    *   Credit risk of the Philippine importers.
    *   Risk of non-conforming LC presentations.
    *   The risk of a potential default by Philippine opening banks.
    *   Political and economic instability in the Philippines impacting importer's or opening bank's ability to pay.
    *   **UCC Article 5 (Letters of Credit)**: While likely not directly applicable (given the international parties), principles of the Uniform Commercial Code regarding letters of credit may influence interpretations. Also, the Uniform Rules for Collection (URC 522) and Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600) should be considered, though they need to be directly incorporated into the language of the Letters of Credit for them to be applicable.

**Key Concerns & Recommendations:**

*   **Governing Law:** Both agreements lack a governing law clause, creating significant uncertainty. The lack of this clause must be addressed immediately, and expert legal consultation should be pursued.
*   **Currency Risk:** Both agreements should address currency conversion and exchange rate risk.
*   **Sovereign Immunity:** The extent to which the CBP has waived sovereign immunity in the event of a dispute should be clarified.
*   **Force Majeure:** Neither agreement includes a *force majeure* clause, which could excuse performance in the event of unforeseen circumstances.
*   **Ambiguity:** The lack of clarity regarding specific procedures for LC issuance and bill acceptance in the Credit Line agreement could lead to disputes.
