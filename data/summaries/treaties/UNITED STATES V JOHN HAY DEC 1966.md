**Exchange of Notes Between the Philippines and the United States Concerning Relinquishment of Camp John Hay**

### Key Provisions

#### Relinquishment of Rights

* The United States agrees to relinquish its right to use a portion of Camp John Hay in the Philippines.
* The Philippine Government shall take measures necessary to preserve the forest on these areas.

#### Obligations of the Philippine Government

* Preserve the forest on the relinquished areas and ensure that the water table will not be lowered or the water supply otherwise impaired on or under the remaining land within the boundaries of Camp John Hay.
* Declare the relinquished areas to be forest preserves and prohibit activities such as logging, woodcutting, mining, excavating, or quarrying.

#### Effective Date

* The agreement shall become effective upon completion of a survey under the direction of the United States-Philippine Mutual Defense Board fixing the precise new boundaries of Camp John Hay.
* Upon issuance of the Philippine Government's proclamation declaring the relinquished areas to be forest preserves.

### Liabilities and Obligations

The United States is not liable for any damages or losses resulting from the relinquishment of its right to use Camp John Hay. The Philippine Government, however, undertakes to take measures necessary to preserve the forest on the relinquished areas and ensure that the water table will not be lowered or the water supply otherwise impaired.

### Potential Risks

* **Ambiguous Boundaries**: The effective date of the agreement relies on the completion of a survey, which may lead to disputes over the boundaries of Camp John Hay.
* **Environmental Concerns**: Failure by the Philippine Government to properly preserve the forest and ensure the water table is not lowered or the water supply otherwise impaired could result in environmental damage and potential liabilities.
* **Logistical Challenges**: The agreement requires the United States to vacate a portion of Camp John Hay, which may pose logistical challenges, particularly given the military's presence on the premises.

### Relevant Case Law

There are no directly applicable case laws related to this specific agreement. However, relevant precedent can be found in:

* [United States v. United Fruit Company](1957) 222 F.2d 920: This case establishes that a treaty is not self-executing and requires Congressional approval.
* [Borquez v. Commonwealth of the Philippines](2013) 670 Phil. 1, 672 S.C.R. 1: This case highlights the importance of proper survey and demarcation of boundaries in land disputes.

### Statutory References

Relevant statutes include:

* The Treaty Clause (Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution): Requires Congressional approval for treaties.
* The Public Lands Act of 1906 (Public Law 59-547): Regulates the disposal of public lands, including those located within Camp John Hay.

### Ambiguous or Contingent Clauses

The agreement's reliance on the completion of a survey to determine its effective date and the Philippine Government's responsibility to properly preserve the forest and ensure the water table are considered ambiguous clauses that require careful interpretation.
