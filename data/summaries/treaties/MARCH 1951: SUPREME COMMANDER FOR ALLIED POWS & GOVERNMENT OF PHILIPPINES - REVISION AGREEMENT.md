**MEMORANDUM AGREEMENT FOR THE REVISION OF THE FINANCIAL AGREEMENT AND TRADE PLAN BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE SUPREME COMMANDER FOR THE ALLIED POWERS**

**Summary:**

This Memorandum Agreement (MA) was entered into on March 3, 1951, between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers acting in respect of Occupied Japan. The MA revises the Financial Agreement and Trade Plan between the two parties, which was initially agreed upon on May 18, 1950.

**Key Provisions:**

* The MA becomes effective only after formalization by both parties; until then, trade between the Philippines and Occupied Japan is governed by the attached documents (Trade Plan No. 3) signed on March 3, 1951.
* The MA aims to revise the Financial Agreement and Trade Plan to promote economic cooperation between the two parties.

**Obligations:**

* Both parties agree to work towards revising the Financial Agreement and Trade Plan to facilitate economic cooperation.
* The Government of the Republic of the Philippines agrees to conduct trade with Occupied Japan in accordance with the attached documents until formalization.

**Liabilities:**

* No specific liabilities are mentioned in the MA. However, any disputes arising from the implementation of the revised Financial Agreement and Trade Plan may be subject to dispute resolution mechanisms under international law or other relevant agreements.

**Potential Risks:**

* Ambiguity in the definition of "formalization" may lead to confusion regarding the effective date of the MA.
* The reliance on attached documents (Trade Plan No. 3) without clear ratification by both parties may create uncertainty about the applicability of these provisions.

**Relevant Case Law:**

* None directly applicable, but relevant principles of international law and treaty interpretation may be considered in resolving disputes arising from this MA.

**Statutory References:**

* The Philippines' Trade and Commerce laws, such as the Trade Facilitation Act of 2015
* Relevant Japanese laws governing trade with Occupied Japan

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

* Section 2 of the MA mentions that trade between the Philippines and Occupied Japan shall be conducted "in accordance therewith" on and after the date of signature. The interpretation of this phrase may be disputed.
* The definition of "formalization" is not explicitly stated in the MA, leaving room for different interpretations.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure clarity and effectiveness in implementing the revised Financial Agreement and Trade Plan, it is recommended that both parties:

1. Clarify the definition of "formalization" through written communication.
2. Ensure that all relevant documents are signed, ratified, or approved by both parties before implementation.
3. Establish clear dispute resolution mechanisms to address any potential disputes arising from the MA.
