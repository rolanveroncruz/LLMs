The text appears to be a draft of the Vienna Agreement on Diplomatic Relations between States with Special Missions, also known as the "Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations" or "1969 Vienna Convention". This convention regulates the relations between states that have diplomatic missions in each other's territory.

The convention covers various aspects of diplomatic relations, including:

* The functions and status of special missions
* The rights and privileges of diplomats and members of their staff
* The conduct of diplomatic relations during times of war or armed conflict
* The protection of premises, property, and archives of the special mission
* The duties and responsibilities of diplomatic representatives
* The non-discrimination principle in applying the provisions of the convention

The convention is open for signature by states that are members of the United Nations or its specialized agencies, as well as other states invited to do so by the General Assembly. It has been ratified by several countries and is expected to come into force on January 1, 1972.

Please note that this is a draft text, and the actual convention may have undergone revisions before its adoption.
