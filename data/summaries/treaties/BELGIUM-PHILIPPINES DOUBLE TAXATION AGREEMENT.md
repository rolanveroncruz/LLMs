This is a protocol agreement between the Kingdom of Belgium and the Republic of the Philippines regarding taxation. Here's a summary of the key points:

**Article 1: Income Derived from Sources within the Philippines**

* The Protocol allows for the exemption of income derived from sources within the Philippines, subject to certain conditions.
* The exemption applies to:
	+ Dividends, interest, and royalties received by a resident of Belgium from a Philippine company
	+ Income from sources within the Philippines that is included in the aggregate income for Belgian tax purposes

**Article 2: Double Taxation**

* The Protocol allows for the credit against Philippine tax of taxes paid or accrued under the laws of Belgium, subject to certain limitations.
* The credit can be taken for:
	+ Income from sources within Belgium
	+ Dividends, interest, and royalties received by a resident of Belgium from a Philippine company (subject to certain conditions)
* The credit is calculated at 10% of the gross amount of the income, but not exceeding that part of the Belgian tax attributable to these items.

**Article 3: Exemption of Dividends**

* Dividends derived by a company which is a resident of Belgium from a company which is a resident of the Philippines are exempt from corporate income tax in Belgium.
* The exemption applies subject to certain conditions and within limits provided for in Belgian law.

**Article 4: Losses Incurred in Permanent Establishments**

* Where losses incurred by an enterprise carried on by a resident of Belgium in a permanent establishment situated in the Philippines have been effectively deducted from the profits of that enterprise for its taxation in Belgium, the exemption provided in sub-paragraph (a) shall not apply to the profits of other taxable periods attributable to that establishment.

**Article 5: Limitations on Credits**

* The amount of credit in respect of taxes paid or accrued under Belgian law shall not exceed the same proportion of taxes covered by the Agreement against which such credit is taken, which the taxpayer's taxable income from sources within Belgium bears to his entire taxable income for the same taxable year.
* The total amount of the credit shall not exceed the same proportion of the taxes covered by the Agreement against which such credit is taken, which the taxpayer's taxable income from sources outside the Philippines bears to his entire taxable income for the same taxable year.

**Article 6: Taxation of Corporate Income**

* In the case of a Philippine corporation owning directly or indirectly more than 50% of the voting stock of a Belgian company from which it receives dividends, the Philippines shall also allow credit for the appropriate amount of taxes paid or accrued to Belgium by a Belgian company paying such dividends with respect to such profits.
