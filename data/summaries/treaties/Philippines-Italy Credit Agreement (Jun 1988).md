**Memorandum Re: Credit Agreement - Philippines and Italy (June 17, 1988)**

**Summary:**

This document is a Credit Agreement between the Government of the Philippines (GOP) and the Government of Italy (GOI), under which Italy will extend a credit of up to $85 million USD to the Philippines for the development of irrigation, specifically the Balog-Balog Multipurpose Project.  10% of the credit can be used for local costs, with a potential extension to 15% subject to Italian Authorities' approval.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Credit Amount:** Up to $85 million USD.
*   **Purpose:** Development of irrigation in the Philippines, specifically the Balog-Balog Multipurpose Project.
*   **Use of Funds:** Primarily for Italian goods and services, with a limited percentage (10%, potentially 15%) for local costs.
*   **Repayment Terms:** 20 half-yearly equal installments, commencing 126 months after the effective date of the *Financial Convention* (Article 4).
*   **Interest Rate:** 1.50% nominal annual interest, payable semi-annually from each drawdown date.
*   **Governing Document:** A separate *Financial Convention* between Mediocredito Centrale (acting for the Italian Government) and the Administrator of the National Irrigation Administration (acting for the GOP) will establish technical arrangements and other detailed conditions.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** Settlement of differences through diplomatic channels.
*   **Effectivity and Termination:** Effective upon signature and terminates upon final payment to Mediocredito Centrale.

**Obligations:**

*   **Philippines:** To utilize the credit for the agreed purpose and repay the loan per the agreed schedule and interest rate. Must comply with the terms outlined in the separate Financial Convention.
*   **Italy:** To make available the credit and ensure that Mediocredito Centrale fulfills its obligations under the Financial Convention.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Philippines:** Default on repayment could trigger remedies available to Mediocredito Centrale and the Italian government, potentially including seizure of assets and adverse impacts on international creditworthiness.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Financial Convention:** The Credit Agreement lacks crucial details, which are deferred to the *Financial Convention* (Article 4).  The exact scope, terms, and conditions are unknown until that document is reviewed.  The obligations of each party are heavily dependent on the terms of this separate agreement.
*   **Currency Fluctuation:** The agreement is denominated in USD.  Currency fluctuations could significantly impact the real cost of repayment for the Philippines.
*   **Project Delays/Cost Overruns:** Delays in the Balog-Balog project could impact the Philippines' ability to generate revenue for repayment. Cost overruns may strain resources.
*   **Interpretation of "Local Costs":** The agreement does not define "local costs" and should be clarified in the financial convention.
* **Force Majeure**: The agreement does not explicitly define the responsibilities and consequences relating to force majeure occurrences.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Sovereign Immunity:** While not explicitly mentioned, principles of sovereign immunity may be relevant in any enforcement action, potentially limiting the ability to seize assets of the Philippine government.  Relevant case law in international law and Philippine law regarding sovereign immunity should be reviewed.
*   **Philippine Government Procurement Laws:** If the local costs provision is triggered, Philippine government procurement laws (RA 9184, as amended) will apply.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The provision allowing a potential increase in the "local costs" usage to 15% is not binding, merely an agreement that "Italian Authorities will consider the further extension." This lacks certainty and enforceability.
*   **Dispute Resolution:**  Relying solely on "diplomatic channels" for dispute resolution may be insufficient, as there is no guarantee of a binding or enforceable outcome. An arbitration clause may be preferable.

**Recommendations:**

*   Obtain and thoroughly review the *Financial Convention* referenced in Article 4.
*   Assess the potential impact of currency fluctuations on the repayment obligation.
*   Clarify the definition of "local costs" in the *Financial Convention*.
*   Evaluate the inclusion of an arbitration clause within the Financial Convention to secure enforceability in the event of future disputes.
* Thoroughly study the legal and practical implications of the current agreement, focusing on both countries laws for conflict resolution.
