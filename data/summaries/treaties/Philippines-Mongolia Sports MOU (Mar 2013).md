## Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Summary: Philippine Sports Commission & Mongolian Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism (March 19, 2013)

**Nature:** Non-binding Memorandum of Understanding outlining general areas of cooperation in sports development and excellence between the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) and the Mongolian Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Objective (Para. 1):** Establishes a framework for future specific programs of cooperation based on reciprocity and mutual benefit. No concrete obligations are created.
*   **Areas of Cooperation (Para. 2):** Encompasses exchange programs (experts, coaches, athletes, etc.), participation in events, and joint sporting events. These are broad, aspirational statements, not binding commitments.
*   **Intellectual Property Rights (Para. 3):** Each party obligated to protect IP rights according to their domestic laws.  Requires *separate* arrangement for IP arising from specific projects, suggesting awareness of potential IP issues. *Potential Risk:* Ambiguity regarding ownership and licensing of IP created jointly.
*   **Financial Condition (Para. 4):** Funding is contingent on mutually determined terms and availability of funds. This significantly limits liability, making actual cooperation dependent on future funding and agreements. *Potential Risk:* Lack of guaranteed funding could render the MOU practically ineffective.
*   **Implementation (Para. 5):** Requires *specific arrangements* for development and implementation of *specific programs* under the MOU, detailing financial matters and responsibilities. This reinforces the non-binding nature of the overall MOU.
*   **Limitation of Activities (Para. 6):** Personnel must respect host country's laws and avoid interference. Failure may result in permit revocation. *Potential Risk:* Enforcement relies on host country's laws and discretion.  Vague language regarding "activities inconsistent with the purposes and objectives" could lead to disputes.
*   **Settlement of Disputes (Para. 7):** Amicable resolution through consultations or negotiations. No provision for arbitration or other binding dispute resolution. *Potential Risk:* Limited recourse in case of disagreements.
*   **Amendment (Para. 8):** Requires mutual consent for any amendment.
*   **Entry into Force, Duration and Termination (Para. 9):** Effective upon signing, lasts five years, terminable with six months' written notice. Termination does not affect ongoing projects.

**Obligations:**

*   Primary obligation is to *consider* joint proposals.
*   Obligation to protect the intellectual property of the other Party in accordance with domestic law.
*   Personnel related to the MOU must comply with the host country's laws and respect its sovereignty.

**Liabilities:**

*   Very limited liability due to non-binding language and funding contingencies.
*   Potential liability arises from failing to protect the other party's intellectual property according to domestic law.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Non-Binding Nature:** The MOU creates a framework for future cooperation but doesn't guarantee any specific actions or funding.
*   **Funding Uncertainty:** Funding is contingent on availability and mutual agreement, potentially rendering the MOU ineffective.
*   **IP Issues:** Lack of specific provisions regarding IP ownership could lead to future disputes.
*   **Enforcement of Conduct:** Enforcement of personnel conduct relies on host country laws and discretion.
*   **Limited Dispute Resolution:** Amicable dispute resolution may not be sufficient in case of serious disagreements.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   *Generally*, MOUs are not legally binding contracts unless they contain specific, definite promises supported by consideration (though this depends on jurisdiction).  Philippine contract law would likely govern interpretation of any subsequent specific agreements.
*   Philippine Intellectual Property Code (Republic Act No. 8293) would govern IP rights protection within the Philippines.
*   International law principles of *pacta sunt servanda* (agreements must be kept) would support the good faith intention to abide by the MOU's stated objectives, although the MOU itself is non-binding.
*   *Magellan Maritime Services Pte. Ltd. vs. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 95529, May 21, 1992) provides guidance on the interpretation of contracts in the Philippines and emphasizes that the intent of the parties is paramount. The lack of specific, enforceable promises suggests no intent to create a legally binding agreement.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   "Activities inconsistent with the purposes and objectives" in Para. 6 is vague and subject to interpretation.
*   The phrase "Detailed proposals for programs of cooperation" in Paragraph 1.

**Conclusion:**

This MOU is a statement of intent, not a binding contract. Its value lies in establishing a framework for future cooperation, but any actual implementation requires further, specific agreements that address funding, responsibilities, and intellectual property rights in detail. The lack of specific obligations significantly reduces liability, but potential risks exist regarding IP and conduct of personnel. Due diligence is required when negotiating any subsequent specific agreements under this MOU.
