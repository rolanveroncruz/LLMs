This is the text of the Convention on Offences and Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, also known as the Montreal Convention. The convention was adopted in 1970 and entered into force in 1988. It sets out the rules for jurisdiction, liability, and compensation in cases involving offenses committed on board aircraft.

The convention is divided into several articles that address specific issues, such as:

* Article 4: Offenses committed on board an aircraft
* Article 9: Restoration of control of the aircraft
* Article 10: Mutual assistance in criminal proceedings
* Article 11: Reporting by Contracting States to the International Civil Aviation Organization
* Article 12: Dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration and the International Court of Justice
* Article 13: Entry into force, ratification, and accession procedures
* Article 14: Denunciation of the convention

The convention is open for signature by states participating in the International Conference on Air Law held at The Hague in 1970, as well as by other states after a period of six months. States may also accede to the convention at any time.

The convention has been ratified or acceded to by many countries and is considered an important tool for regulating crimes committed on board aircraft.
