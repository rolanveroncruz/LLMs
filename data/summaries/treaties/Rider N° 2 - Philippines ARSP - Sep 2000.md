**Legal Document Summary: Rider No. 2 to Financing Memorandum ALA/94/29 (Agrarian Reform Support Project)**

**Date:** September 27, 2000

**Parties:**

*   The Commission of the European Communities (THE COMMISSION), acting for and on behalf of the European Community (THE COMMUNITY)
*   The Government of the Republic of the Philippines (THE RECIPIENT)

**Purpose:**

*   Rider No. 2 amends the original Financing Memorandum (ALA/94/29) and Rider No. 1 regarding the Agrarian Reform Support Project (ARSP). Key changes include extending the project duration and reallocating funds among project components.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Extended Duration:** Project implementation period extended to December 31, 2001, with the Memorandum valid until December 31, 2003, to allow for payment processing and evaluations. This extended duration is a key factor in evaluating any claims arising after the original, pre-amended, expiration date.
*   **Financial Commitment:** The COMMUNITY's commitment remains at EURO 20,000,000 (THE EC GRANT). References to ECU are replaced with EURO, effective January 1, 1999. The extended implementation deadline is contingent upon a final implementation date.
*   **Fund Reallocation:** Funds are reallocated among "Land Transfer," "Institutional Strengthening," "Productivity Systems Development," "Project Administration," "Technical Assistance," "External Evaluation," and "Contingencies."  Notably, funding for "Contingencies" is reduced to zero, while "Project Administration" receives a significant increase. *This reallocation could impact liability if specific projects are delayed or fail due to reduced funding.*
*   **Technical Assistance:**  Technical assistance is specified as approximately 213 man-months of expatriate and 396 man-months of local consulting services.
*   **Philippine Government Contribution:** The Recipient's contribution is EURO 6,833,000, covering salary costs of government personnel and office space. Crucially, this contribution *does not* include land acquisition costs or compensation for rights of way, which remain the full responsibility of the Philippine Government.
*   **Visibility Clause (3.10):**  A new clause (3.10) is inserted, requiring maximum visibility for the EC's cooperation. The Philippines must avoid confusion with other international bodies and prominently display the European Symbol.  *Failure to comply could jeopardize future funding or result in clawback of funds under the current agreement.*

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Non-Compliance with Visibility Clause:** Failure to adequately promote the EC's involvement could lead to disputes and potential financial penalties.
*   **Delays in Land Acquisition:**  The Philippine government bears full responsibility for land acquisition and rights-of-way costs. Delays or cost overruns in this area could significantly impact project implementation.
*   **Inefficient Project Administration:** A substantial increase in funding for project administration coupled with delays in land acquisition could lead to an implication of inefficient use of fund.
*   **Breach of Contract:** Failure to meet project objectives or comply with the terms of the Financing Memorandum (as amended) could constitute a breach of contract, potentially leading to legal action by THE COMMISSION.
*   **Unclear Definition of "Proper Justification":**  The phrase "properly justified" regarding extension requests leaves room for interpretation and potential disputes.
*   **Contingency Removal:** The removal of funding for contingencies creates a high risk of delays or project failure due to unforeseen circumstances.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Applicable Law:** The Financing Memorandum itself should specify the governing law. In absence, international law.
*   **Contract Law Principles:**  Standard contract law principles regarding breach of contract, specific performance, and damages would apply.
*   **Sovereign Immunity:**  The extent to which the Republic of the Philippines may invoke sovereign immunity in any dispute should be investigated.
*   **European Union Law:** Relevant EU regulations and directives regarding development assistance and project funding may be applicable.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "properly justified" regarding extension requests is open to interpretation.
*   The reallocation of funds, particularly the reduction of the contingency budget to zero.
*   Lack of specifics around failure to adequately provide visibility to the EC.

**Recommendations for Lawyer:**

1.  Review the original Financing Memorandum and Rider No. 1 for additional relevant clauses.
2.  Determine the governing law and dispute resolution mechanism specified in the agreement.
3.  Assess the Philippine government's compliance with land acquisition obligations.
4.  Evaluate the adequacy of project management and oversight mechanisms.
5.  Consider drafting a force majeure clause in future agreements.
6.  Conduct due diligence to ensure the project aligns with EU development assistance policies.
7.  Clarify the definition of "properly justified" for extension requests in future agreements.
