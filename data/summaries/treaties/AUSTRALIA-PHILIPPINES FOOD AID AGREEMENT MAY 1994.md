This is a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GOP) and the Government of Australia (GOA), regarding the Australian Government's food aid contribution to the Agriculture Sector Support Program in the Philippines. The MOU outlines the terms and conditions for the provision of Australian food aid wheat flour to support the project.

The key points of the MOU are:

1. **Termination**: The MOU will terminate sixty days after written notice is provided by either party.
2. **Amendments**: Amendments can be made at any time with a mutual agreement between the two governments.
3. **Counterpart Funds**: The Australian Government will provide counterpart funds to support the project, which will be used for the purchase of rice and other expenses.
4. **Interest-bearing Account**: A separate interest-bearing account, called the "Australian Food Aid Fund Account" (AFAFA), will be established by the GOA and WFP to manage the counterpart funds.
5. **Bidding Process**: The World Food Programme (WFP) will participate in an ad-hoc bidding committee to review the bidding process and determine the successful bid for the purchase of Australian food aid wheat flour.
6. **Monetization**: The international market price per tonne of rice will be used to determine the quantity of Australia's food aid contribution, and any shortfall in funds required to purchase rice will be made up by the GOP.

The MOU also includes two annexes: Annex A, which outlines the arrangements for monetization and counterpart funds, and Annex B, which provides details on the Australian Government's food aid contribution.
