## Summary of Philippine Abaca Fiber Agreement (August 6, 1946)

**Parties:** Republic of the Philippines ("Republic") and Reconstruction Finance Corporation ("RFC") (US Government agency).

**Effective Dates:** August 8, 1946 to June 30, 1947 (but effectively terminated earlier).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Exclusive Purchase Right (Clause 2):** RFC had the exclusive right to purchase the entire exportable surplus of Philippine abaca fiber of specified grades. This is a crucial provision establishing a monopoly.
*   **Pricing (Clause 3):**  Fixed prices for various grades of abaca fiber, FOB Philippine ports, in US currency.  Includes a price adjustment mechanism contingent on significant freight rate changes. Specifies grades and origins (Davao vs. Non-Davao).
*   **Quality Standards (Clause 4):** Defines grades based on Fiber Inspection Administrative Order No. 4 (Revised Dec. 1, 1939) of the Philippine Fiber Inspection Service.  Specifies baling requirements.
*   **Payment Terms (Clause 5):** RFC paid 80% of purchase price via letter of credit upon presentation of shipping documents; balance adjusted after weighing and inspection at US port. Stipulates invoiced bale weights versus actual landed weights.
*   **Taxes and Risk Allocation (Clause 6):** Seller responsible for all Philippine taxes, fees, and charges, as well as risk and cost until fiber is loaded on the ocean carrier. The Republic agreed to not collect any taxes, fees or charges from the RFC.
*   **Delivery Basis (Clause 7):** Allowed for purchase on bases other than FOB, with appropriate price adjustments.
*   **Export Restriction (Clause 8):** The Republic agreed to restrict abaca exports solely to the United States for RFC or its designees/consignees.
*   **Production and Export Effort (Clause 9):** Requires the Republic to use its "best efforts" to maximize abaca production and export to RFC, preventing export restrictions to the US.
*   **Price Ceilings and Inventory Control (Clause 10):** The Republic agreed to establish price ceilings for local manufacturers, not exceeding FOB prices, and to prevent excessive inventory accumulation by cordage mills.
*   **NAFCO Contract (Clause 11):** The Republic agreed that NAFCO (National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation, a Philippine government agency) would contract with RFC to sell abaca from specific sources (primarily Japanese-controlled land). Fiber had to be specially marked.
*   **NAFCO Advance (Clause 12):** RFC would advance $2,000,000 to NAFCO for rehabilitating abaca plantations formerly controlled by Japanese interests. The Republic guaranteed repayment.  Repayment terms specified, including deductions from abaca sales and potential interest.
*   **Dispute Resolution (Clause 13):** All doubts and difficulties will be settled between governments of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the United States of America

**Obligations:**

*   **Republic:** Implement export restrictions, maximize production, prevent domestic price increases, and guarantee NAFCO's obligations. Guarantee $2,000,000 loan.
*   **RFC:** Purchase the entire exportable surplus, provide letters of credit, and advance funds to NAFCO.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Republic:** Liability for repayment of the $2,000,000 advance to NAFCO, especially if NAFCO defaults.
*   **Sellers:** Responsible for taxes and losses until shipment.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **"Best Efforts" Standard (Clause 9 & 10):** The term "best efforts" is ambiguous and could be subject to interpretation and potential disputes. Case law on the definition of "best efforts" in similar commercial agreements would be relevant.
*   **Freight Rate Adjustment (Clause 3):** The materiality standard for freight rate changes triggering price reconsideration is undefined and could lead to disagreements.
*   **Enforcement of Export Restriction (Clause 8):** The agreement lacks specific enforcement mechanisms for the export restriction, which could lead to breaches and disputes. The Republic needs to monitor and enforce compliance.
*   **Market Fluctuation:** The fixed prices may not reflect market values over time, which is expressly what the Vice President of the Phillippines pointed out in the November 5, 1946 letter.
*   **NAFCO solvency:** NAFCO's financial standing is crucial for the repayment of the loan, since Republic of Philippines will have to cover any shortfall.
*   **Undue Influence / Lack of Fair Consideration:** The Republic's request for abrogation, combined with its assertions of undue burden due to rising production costs and static pricing, suggests the potential argument that the agreement was unfair or lacked adequate consideration for the Republic.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Fiber Inspection Administrative Order No. 4 (Revised Dec. 1, 1939):** This is the key Philippine law defining abaca fiber grades and quality standards.
*   Contract law principles regarding "best efforts" clauses, consideration, and force majeure.
*   Principles related to sovereign immunity, since the Republic of the Philippines is a party.

**Abrogation:** The agreement was requested to be abrogated by the Philippines on November 18, 1946, and was abrogated on December 3, 1946 by the US. This was due to rising costs of production and changes in world market conditions.

**Conclusion:**

This agreement creates a monopolistic buying arrangement heavily favoring the RFC. The Republic assumes significant obligations, including a financial guarantee, export restrictions, and domestic price controls. The biggest risks lie in the "best efforts" provisions, the lack of clear enforcement mechanisms, the financial health of NAFCO, and the now-moot point of fixed prices relative to market fluctuations. However, given that it was officially cancelled in December 3, 1946, its effect on market conditions was shortlived. Any remaining dispute would rely on the agreement that Philippines would repay the $2,000,000 loan.
