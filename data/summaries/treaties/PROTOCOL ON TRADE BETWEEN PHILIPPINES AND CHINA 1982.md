**Ambiguous or Contingent Clauses**

*   Clause 3 of Article 1 states that "the prices and other transaction terms of the commodities mentioned above will be arranged by trade organizations or import and export traders of the two countries." This clause may lead to disputes over pricing and transaction terms.
*   Clause 4 allows for other commercial transactions between trade organizations or import/export traders, which could potentially conflict with the agreed-upon commodities and quantities.
