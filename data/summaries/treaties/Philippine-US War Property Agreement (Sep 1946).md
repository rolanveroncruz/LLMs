## Summary of 1946 Surplus War Property Agreement (Philippines-US)

**Overview:** This agreement governs the sale and grant of US surplus war property located in the Philippines to the Philippine government following WWII. It leverages the US Surplus Property Act of 1944 and the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1 (Property Sold and Granted):** Defines the scope of property transferred. Excludes aircraft, ships (except as later specified), and non-demilitarized combat material. Subject to US declarations of surplus. Allows US to retain property worth $10M for existing credit arrangements with other countries.
*   **Article 2 (Transfer of Possession):**  Outlines transfer timelines and responsibilities. The Philippines assumes risk of loss and liability 60 days after notice of availability, or upon actual transfer, whichever occurs first. The Philippines is responsible for all handling, transportation, and storage costs. Indemnifies the US from any claims arising from the ownership of the property.
*   **Article 3 (Distribution):** Mandates the Philippines to use established commercial channels for resale and ensure equal opportunity for US distributors.
*   **Article 4 (Warranties):** US warrants title but provides limited warranty on the property's condition or fitness. Allows for consultation and price adjustments in case of material disparity.
*   **Article 5 (Consideration):**
    *   $100M of the property is granted under the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946, relieving the US of obligations under that act. The proceeds from the sale of this property must be used in accordance with Section 201 of the Rehabilitation Act.
    *   The US pays the Philippines $25M to partially cover war-related financial obligations (emergency currency, loans, etc.). In exchange, the Philippines releases the US from any remaining claims related to these obligations and indemnifies them.
    *   The Philippines makes available $5M to the US: $3M for real estate purchases in the Philippines and $2M for cultural/educational activities.
*   **Article 6 (Miscellaneous Provisions):** Includes ships (up to $6M value) in the transfer. Requires a separate agreement for operation of weather/communication services related to transferred aircraft. Restricts import of US-origin property back to the US. Requires the Philippines to pay all applicable taxes and duties. The transfer of title to fixed installations is subject to approval by US agencies.

**Obligations:**

*   **US:**  Transfer surplus property, warrant title, pay $25M.
*   **Philippines:** Accept property, handle distribution fairly, pay for handling/transportation/storage, indemnify the US, make $5M available to the US, operate weather/communication services, and avoid re-importation of US goods.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Philippines:** Responsible for all risks of loss and liabilities associated with the property after transfer of possession, including storage costs, damages, and claims.  Must indemnify the US.
*   **US:** Liable for its financial obligations to the Philippines related to war-time currency and advances, up to the agreed amount.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **"Material Disparity" (Article 4):** The definition of "material disparity" is vague and could lead to disputes over price adjustments. This requires further definition.
*   **"Equal Opportunity" (Article 3):** Defining and ensuring "equal opportunity" for US distributors in the Philippine resale market is potentially contentious and may require a detailed implementation plan to prevent discrimination claims. Anti-trust concerns may arise if "equal opportunity" is not fairly administered.
*   **Real Estate Purchase (Article 5(c)(1)):** Agreeing on "prices to be agreed upon by the Governments" is open to protracted negotiations and potential disputes, especially considering the post-war context.
*   **"Best Endeavors" (Article 6(c)):** The term "best endeavors" regarding import restrictions is weaker than "best efforts" or "all reasonable efforts," leaving room for interpretation and potential breaches. (See *IBM United Kingdom Ltd v Rockware Glass Ltd [1980] FSR 335* for case law on the interpretation of "best endeavours.")
*   **Property identification Methods and Procedure (Article 5a):** US is given sole power to identify property under Rehabilitation Act of 1946
*   **Property removal and Rental Arrangements (Article 2c):** The Philippines assumes the obligation to enter rental arrangements, which is not well-defined, creating a potential loophole.

**Relevant Statutes:**

*   **US Surplus Property Act of 1944:** Authorizes the disposal of surplus property.
*   **Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946:** Authorizes the grant of surplus property to the Philippines.

**Next Steps:**

*   Define "material disparity" in Article 4 more precisely.
*   Clarify the mechanism for ensuring "equal opportunity" for US distributors.
*   Develop a clear process for price negotiation for real estate purchases in the Philippines.
*   Strengthen the language regarding import restrictions (Article 6(c)).
*   Determine ownership status of land identified in article 2f.
*   Provide a detailed methodology and procedure for the identification of property transferred under the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946.
*   Provide a plan for the Philippines to assume rental arrangements under Article 2c.
