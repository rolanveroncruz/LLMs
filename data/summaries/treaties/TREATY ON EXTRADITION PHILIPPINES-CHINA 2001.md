This is a copy of the Extradition Treaty between the Republic of the Philippines and the People's Republic of China, which was signed on October 30, 2001. The treaty governs the extradition of individuals between the two countries in cases where one country requests the extradition of an individual from the other.

Here are some key aspects of the treaty:

**Extradition Process**: The treaty outlines a process for requesting extradition, including notification to the requesting party and agreement on a new date for surrender. If the person is not surrendered or taken over, the two parties must agree on a new date.

**Surrender of Property**: The treaty requires the requested party to hand over property related to the offense to the requesting party upon request.

**Rules of Speciality**: The treaty prohibits the extradition of a person for an offense committed prior to their extradition, except in specific circumstances (e.g., if the offense is also extraditable under the treaty).

**Re-Extradition**: A person who has been extradited cannot be extradited again unless the requested party consents or if they have had the opportunity to leave and return within 45 days.

**Transit**: The treaty allows for transit through one country's territory with written permission.

**Relation with Other Treaties**: The treaty does not affect any rights or obligations of the parties under other treaties.

**Dispute Resolution**: Any disputes arising from the implementation or interpretation of the treaty are to be settled through diplomatic channels.

**Entry into Force and Termination**: The treaty requires ratification by both countries, and it enters into force 30 days after exchange of instruments. Either party can terminate the treaty with six months' notice.

This treaty provides a framework for cooperation between the Philippines and China on extradition matters, promoting mutual trust and cooperation in combating crime and terrorism.
