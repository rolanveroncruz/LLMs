## Summary of the Supplementary Convention Amending the Austria-Philippines Social Security Convention

**Document:** Supplementary Convention Amending the Convention between the Republic of Austria and the Republic of the Philippines in the field of Social Security (signed September 15, 2000).

**Purpose:** To amend and supplement the original Social Security Convention of December 1, 1980, between Austria and the Philippines.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article I (Amendment of Existing Articles):** This article contains the substantive amendments.

    *   **Definition of "Competent Authority" (Art 1(1)(5)):** Updates the definition of "competent authority" to clarify the responsible bodies in both countries for administering social security legislation.  This focuses the obligations on specific administrative bodies, potentially creating an avenue for litigation based on failure to properly administer by the designated authorities.
    *   **Scope Extended to Sickness Insurance (Art 2(1)(1)(c)):** Section II of the Convention is now explicitly extended to sickness insurance benefits. This creates a new class of potential claimants and increases the scope of benefits.
    *   **Application to Consolidated/Amended Legislation (Art 2(2)):** Clarifies that the Convention also applies to any subsequent legislation consolidating, amending, or supplementing the listed legislation.
    *   **Persons Covered (Art 3):**  Broadens the scope to include not just those directly subject to legislation but also those deriving rights *from* them. This might include dependents, heirs, or other beneficiaries, adding potential third-party beneficiaries to the agreement.
    *   **Crediting of War Service (Art 4(3)):** Grants Philippine nationals who were Austrian nationals before March 13, 1938, equal treatment with Austrian nationals regarding the crediting of war service periods, impacting benefit calculations. This equal treatment provision creates a specific protected class, opening avenues for potential discrimination claims if not implemented correctly.
    *   **Legislation Governing Employment (Art 6):** Generally, employment in one country subjects the person *only* to the social security legislation of that country, even if the employer is based elsewhere. This prevents dual social security taxation.
    *   **Temporary Detachment (Art 7):** Allows temporary work assignments (up to 60 months) in the other country without changing the applicable social security legislation. Extends this rule indefinitely for air transport organizations. Government employees are subject to the host country's laws if they're nationals or residents.
    *   **Exceptions by Agreement (Art 7A):**  Allows competent authorities to grant exceptions to the rules on applicable legislation on a case-by-case basis, enabling flexibility. Requires mutual agreement between competent authorities, adding an administrative burden.
    *   **Benefit Calculation (Articles 10, 11, and 12):** Specifies how benefits are calculated when insurance periods are completed in both countries. Pro-rata calculations based on insurance periods and theoretical benefits are outlined. Minimum periods are necessary for benefit eligibility.
    *   **Deletion of Articles 13 & 14:**  Deletes Articles, potentially removing benefits, obligations, or administrative procedures. The specific content of the deleted articles must be analyzed from the original 1980 convention to ascertain the potential impact of this deletion.
    *   **Deletion from Article 15(1):** Deletes the second sentence, possibly affecting administrative procedures or information exchange requirements. As with Articles 13 & 14, the precise impact must be ascertained from the original convention.

**Liabilities:**

*   Failure to properly administer benefits according to the Convention's provisions could lead to legal action by affected individuals.
*   Incorrect calculation of benefits could result in financial liabilities for the competent authorities.
*   Discrimination claims could arise if the equal treatment provisions are not properly implemented.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity in "Deriving Rights":** The phrase "other persons with respect to the rights they derive from" in Article 3(b) is potentially ambiguous and could lead to disputes regarding the scope of beneficiaries.
*   **Discretion in Granting Exceptions:** The discretionary power granted to competent authorities in Article 7A to make exceptions could be abused or applied inconsistently, potentially leading to legal challenges.
*   **Complexity of Benefit Calculation:** The benefit calculation methods outlined in Articles 10, 11, and 12 are complex and could be prone to errors or disputes.
*   **Lack of Clarity Regarding Deleted Articles:** Deletion of Articles 13 and 14, and the sentence in 15(1) could create uncertainty if the specific content of these provisions is not clear or if the impact of their removal is not fully understood.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   This document amends the initial Austria-Philippines Social Security Convention of December 1, 1980. Any existing case law interpreting the original convention must be considered in light of these amendments.
*   The specific national social security laws of Austria and the Philippines, as referenced in the amended definitions, must be examined to understand their interaction with the convention.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "persons with respect to the rights they derive from" in Article 3(b) is a potential source of contention.
*   The discretionary application of Article 7A could lead to disputes.
*   The calculation methods in Articles 10, 11, and 12 are complex and could be challenged.
*   Impact of deletion of Articles 13 and 14 and the sentence in 15(1).

**Recommendation:**

A detailed analysis of the original 1980 convention, including Articles 13 and 14 and the relevant sentence in 15(1), is necessary to fully understand the implications of these amendments. Further clarification of the intended scope of "deriving rights from" is advisable to prevent future disputes.
