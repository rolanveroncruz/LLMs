**Potential Risks:**

1. **Ambiguity in Article III**: The effectiveness clause may be interpreted differently by both parties, potentially leading to disputes over renewal or termination.

**Recommendations:**

3. Establish a dispute resolution mechanism to address any potential conflicts or ambiguities.

**Conclusion:**
