*   **Failure to Meet Objectives:** If the SAIL micro-credit program fails to achieve its sustainability goals within the two-year timeframe, SCF could be held accountable, potentially affecting future funding opportunities.
*   **Breach of Contract:** Failure to fulfill any of the obligations outlined in the MOA could result in breach of contract and potential legal remedies sought by AECI.
*   **Auditing Issues:** Non-compliance with Spanish auditing requirements (Clause TWELFTH) could lead to penalties or legal action.
*   **DBP Performance:** The SCF's success is partially dependent on DBP's performance. DBP mismanagement or failure to disburse funds effectively could negatively impact the project and expose SCF to liability.
*   **Lack of Clarity:** The MOA refers to other agreements (between AECI and the Provincial Government, and between SCF and DBP) which are not included. The success of this MOA relies on those agreements being enforced.
*   **Time sensitivity: The document is dated 2000. Reviewing parties should ascertain whether this MOA is still in effect**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Sustainability":** The definition of "sustainability" is not clearly defined in the MOA, which could lead to disagreements on whether SCF has met its objectives.
*   **Control over DBP:** SCF's obligation to "enforce" the terms of the agreement with DBP may be difficult to fulfill.
*   **Governing Law and Dispute Resolution:** The MOA does not specify the governing law or dispute resolution mechanism, which could create uncertainty in the event of a disagreement.

**Case Law Considerations:**

*   General contract law principles would apply to the interpretation and enforcement of this MOA.
*   *Relevant Case Law:* Philippine jurisprudence on contracts, particularly those involving government entities and NGOs, may be relevant.  Spanish law regarding international aid agreements might also be applicable.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Review related agreements:** Obtain and review the MOAs between AECI and the Provincial Government, and between SCF and DBP.
*   **Clarify "Sustainability":** Establish clear metrics for determining the sustainability of the SAIL micro-credit program.
*   **Due Diligence on DBP:** Assess DBP's performance record and financial stability.
*   **Amend MOA (if applicable):** If the parties intend to extend or modify the agreement, a formal amendment should be executed.
*   **Determine current Status:** Ascertain if the agreement is still in effect.
