Okay, here's a legal summary of the 1987/88 Rescheduling Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the Export Development Corporation (EDC) of Canada.

**Document Summary: 1987/88 Rescheduling Agreement (Republic of the Philippines and Export Development Corporation)**

**Nature:** Debt Rescheduling Agreement.

**Parties:**

*   **Obligor:** The Republic of the Philippines ("OBLIGOR").
*   **Creditor:** Export Development Corporation ("EDC"), a Canadian Crown corporation.

**Date:** March 29, 1988.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Purpose:** Implements the Agreed Minute of January 22, 1987, resulting from Paris Club negotiations, to provide debt relief by consolidating and rescheduling certain loan agreements (listed in Schedule "A") made before April 1, 1984.  Schedule A is considered conclusive evidence of indebtedness.
*   **Consolidated Debt:** Reschedules principal and interest payments due between January 1, 1987, and June 30, 1988 (the "Consolidation Period"). Specific amounts in Canadian and US dollars are detailed in Section 2 and Schedule A.
*   **Payment Schedule:**
    *   100% of principal and 70% of interest falling due during the consolidation period will be paid in 10 semi-annual installments from April 1, 1993 to October 1, 1997.
    *   The Obligor will continue to pay 30% of the interest amounts falling due during the Consolidation Period.
*   **Interest:**
    *   Interest is calculated on both Canadian and US dollar amounts based on LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus 0.5%. LIBOR is determined by reference to Bank of Montreal (for CAD) and Citibank N.A. (for USD).
    *   Interest is calculated in arrears and compounded as of each Interest Date.
    *   Late payment interest is LIBOR + 1%.
    *   Provides a fallback mechanism if LIBOR is unavailable, requiring good faith negotiation and, failing agreement, EDC determining the rate based on its cost of funds plus 0.5%, granting the Obligor prepayment rights.
*   **Place and Manner of Payment:** Specifies the bank accounts (Bank of Montreal for CAD, Citibank N.A. for USD) and timing of payments. All payments must be made without set-off or counterclaim and free from taxes.
*   **Application of Payments:** Payments are applied first to outstanding amounts due, then to principal in inverse order of maturity.
*   **Prepayment:** The OBLIGOR can prepay on any Interest Date, with 30 days prior notice, in whole or in multiple instalments.
*   **Conditions Precedent:** Requires favorable legal opinions from the Philippine Ministry of Justice and EDC's Philippine counsel (Schedule B).
*   **Governing Law:** Laws of Ontario and Canada.
*   **Jurisdiction:** OBLIGOR consents to jurisdiction in Ontario courts, Philippine courts, and any other court with jurisdiction.
*   **Waiver of Immunity:** The OBLIGOR irrevocably waives sovereign immunity.

**Obligations of the Republic of the Philippines:**

*   Pay rescheduled principal and interest according to the agreed schedule.
*   Pay interest on outstanding amounts and any late payments.
*   Provide required legal opinions for the agreement to become effective.
*   Comply with payment instructions and ensure payments are made without deduction.
*   Defend against any claims or actions related to the loan agreements.
*   Adhere to the governing law and jurisdictional clauses.

**Liabilities of the Republic of the Philippines:**

*   Financial liability for the rescheduled debt, interest, and any late payment penalties.
*   Legal liability for breach of the agreement, subject to the jurisdiction clauses.
*   Potential for litigation in multiple jurisdictions.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Schedule "A":** Reliance on Schedule "A" as conclusive evidence is significant.  Any errors or omissions in Schedule "A" could lead to disputes.  Due diligence on the accuracy of this schedule is critical.
*   **LIBOR Transition:**  The agreement references LIBOR. Given LIBOR's discontinuation, a review of the fallback provisions in Section 3(f) is critical. The provision requiring "good faith negotiation" could be a source of contention if the parties disagree on a replacement benchmark. *See:* potential issues in *Sonterra Capital Master Fund, Ltd. v. Credit Suisse AG*, 2023 WL 4561521 (S.D.N.Y. July 17, 2023).
*   **Sovereign Immunity Waiver:** While the waiver appears comprehensive, enforceability depends on the specific assets being targeted for enforcement and relevant international law principles. *See:* *Argentine Republic v. NML Capital, Ltd.*, 573 U.S. 134 (2014).
*   **Jurisdictional Choice:** The multiple jurisdictional options (Ontario, Philippines, "any other courts") could lead to forum shopping by EDC.
*   **"Agreed Minute" Incorporation:**  The agreement references and is based upon the "Agreed Minute". This document is not included in the content provided and could influence how the terms of this contract are understood. A close reading of the Agreed Minute is important.
* **Force Majeure:** The document does not contain any force majeure clause. As a result the Republic of the Philippines may have no protection from unforseen events such as natural disasters or financial crisis that may affect their ability to pay.

**Case Law & Statutory Considerations:**

*   **Canadian Law (Ontario):** The enforceability of the agreement is governed by Ontario law and applicable Canadian federal law. Principles of contract interpretation under Canadian law will apply.
*   **Sovereign Debt Litigation:**  The waiver of sovereign immunity is crucial and should be analyzed in light of relevant case law on sovereign immunity and its limitations.
*   **International Law:** Principles of international law regarding sovereign debt restructuring may be relevant.

**Recommendations:**

*   Verify the accuracy of Schedule "A" against underlying loan documentation.
*   Analyze the fallback provisions for LIBOR cessation and potential disputes.
*   Assess the potential challenges in enforcing the waiver of sovereign immunity.
*   Conduct due diligence on the financial status of the Republic of the Philippines.
*   Locate the "Agreed Minute" and determine if its terms affect the interpretation of this agreement.

This summary provides a high-level overview. A comprehensive legal review would require a more detailed analysis of the agreement and relevant factual circumstances.
