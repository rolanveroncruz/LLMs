**Legal Summary: US-Philippines Agreement on Fund for Assistance to Private Education (June 11, 1968)**

This document comprises an exchange of notes between the US and the Philippines, constituting an agreement on the use of the Special Fund for Education (authorized by US Public Law 88-94 amending the Philippine War Damage Legislation of 1962) to establish a Fund for Assistance to Private Education. The agreement entered into force on June 11, 1968.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Establishment of Fund:** The Philippines undertakes to create a permanent trust fund ("the Fund") for the benefit of private education. Principal is to remain intact, with only earnings used for programs (excluding religious instruction/worship).
*   **Funding:** The US will disburse $6,154,000 from the Special Fund for Education to designated depository banks in the Philippines, credited to the Fund. Disbursement occurs within two weeks of trust deed execution.
*   **Trustee:** A Private Education Assistance Committee ("the Committee") will act as trustee, setting investment policy, establishing priorities, processing project applications, and making decisions on fund use. Composition includes the Secretary of Education (or representative), a representative from the National Economic Council, and representatives from three educational associations. Decisions require the Chairmanâ€™s concurrence.
*   **Investment & Management:** The Committee can retain an investment and financial manager.
*   **Guidelines for Fund Use:** The Committee must consider factors such as project contribution to education quality, relation to prioritized fields of study, institutional contribution to specific regions, amount of funds requested, and past/current efforts to improve education quality.
*   **Reporting:** The Philippine government will provide the US government with an annual report on the Fund's activities.
*   **Acknowledgement:** Projects and buildings funded by the Fund must acknowledge the contribution of the US Special Fund for Education made available by the people of the United States during World War II.

**Obligations:**

*   **US:** Disbursement of funds.
*   **Philippines:** Establishment and maintenance of the trust fund, management by the Committee, adherence to guidelines for fund use, provision of annual reports, and acknowledgement of US contribution.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Breach of Trust:** Failure to maintain the principal, improper use of funds (e.g., religious instruction), or mismanagement by the Committee could constitute a breach of trust. This could lead to legal action by the US or other interested parties.
*   **Investment Risks:** Poor investment decisions could deplete the fund, affecting its ability to support private education. The Committee's discretion in investment policy needs careful consideration.
*   **Interpretation of "Earnings":** The agreement defines how the earnings of the funds are to be utilized. Any other usage might constitute a violation of the terms stipulated in the agreement.
*   **Enforcement:** The agreement doesn't explicitly detail enforcement mechanisms for breaches. Dispute resolution mechanisms are also not clearly defined.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **US Public Law 88-94:** The authorizing legislation for the Special Fund for Education.
*   **Philippine War Damage Legislation of 1962:** Amended by US Public Law 88-94.
*   **Trust Law:** Applicable to the establishment and management of the trust fund. Philippine law regarding trusts would govern the trustee's duties and liabilities.
*   The interpretation of this agreement and any potential claim will be affected by general principles of international law and applicable treaties between the Philippines and the United States, if any.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Earnings" of the fund:** The definition might become a point of contention, particularly concerning capital gains and their treatment.
*   **"Improvement in the quality of Philippine Education":** This is a broad standard, potentially leading to disputes about project eligibility.
*   **Implementation Schedule:** The schedule is provided with specific dates of action which should be reviewed to ascertain if these were followed. This also applies to the other terms.

**Legal Advice:**

Review the Trust Deed establishing the Private Education Assistance Committee to ensure consistency with the agreement. Clarify the definition of "earnings" for investment and fund use purposes. Establish clear enforcement and dispute resolution mechanisms.
