Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) formatted in Markdown:

**MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SUMMARY**

**Document:** Memorandum of Understanding on Information Cooperation between the Presidential Communications Operations Office of the Republic of the Philippines and the Ministry of Information of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar

**Date:** December 05, 2013

**Parties:**
*   Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) of the Republic of the Philippines
*   Ministry of Information of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar

**Nature:** Non-binding MOU outlining cooperation in the field of information (news exchange, broadcasting, film, IT, public relations, printing/publishing). **Crucially, Paragraph 9 states explicitly that this MOU does not create legally binding obligations under international law.**

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Objective (Para. 1):** To encourage and promote cooperation in information fields for mutual benefit, subject to existing laws and regulations.
*   **Fields of Cooperation (Para. 2):** Broadly defined to include News Exchange, Radio & Television Broadcasting, Film Industries, Information Technology, Public Relations, Printing & Publishing, and other mutually agreed areas.
*   **Forms of Cooperation (Para. 3):** Includes exchange of information/materials, personnel, technical facilities, joint ventures, film festivals, training, and other mutually agreed forms. Specifies details on exchanged materials in Para 3 A (1-6)
*   **Exchange Programmes (Para. 4):** Participants will develop exchange programs to facilitate cooperation.
*   **Implementing Arrangements (Para. 5):** Appointment of focal persons, possibility of specific arrangements (potentially legally binding contracts) for projects, establishment of Working Groups.
*   **Confidentiality (Para. 6):** Obligation not to disclose received materials to third parties without prior written consent; survives termination.
*   **Intellectual Property (Para. 7):** Responsibility for IP rights lies with the sending party; sending party is responsible for honorarium payments or financial conditions associated with the use of materials
*   **Conditions on Use of Materials (Para. 8):** Receiving party has discretion in use, materials are exchanged free of charge, no third-party hand-over or commercial use.
*   **Consultations (Para. 10):** Disputes resolved amicably through consultations, without recourse to third-party arbitration.
*   **Amendments (Para. 11):** Amendments must be in writing and agreed upon by both parties.
*   **Suspension (Para. 12):** Either party may suspend implementation for security, public order, or public health reasons, with 30-day written notice.
*   **Effectivity & Termination (Para. 13):** Effective upon signature, valid for two years, renewable, and terminable with 60-day written notice.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The MOU itself doesn't create binding obligations (Para. 9).
*   Obligations may arise from *specific arrangements* entered into pursuant to Para. 5(B). These subsequent agreements, if properly drafted, *could* create legally enforceable obligations.
*   Responsibility for IP protection lies with the sending party (Para. 7).
*   Sending Party is responsible for any payments for use of materials (Para. 7(B))
*   Confidentiality obligations exist and survive termination (Para. 6).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Enforceability:** The MOU explicitly states it's not legally binding. This presents a risk if either party fails to uphold its commitments. Reliance on "good faith" cooperation.
*   **Vagueness:** Broad language in the "Fields of Cooperation" and "Forms of Cooperation" sections can lead to misunderstandings or disagreements on the scope of the agreement.
*   **Funding Issues:** Cooperation is subject to the availability of funds and resources. Potential for projects to stall due to lack of resources.
*   **IP Disputes:** While the sending party is responsible for IP rights, disputes could still arise regarding ownership, licensing, or infringement.
*   **Third-Party Claims:** Though materials can't be handed over to third parties without consent (Para 8 A (iii)), there could be claims from third parties related to the content itself (e.g., defamation, copyright infringement within the original material).
*   **Political Instability:** The right to suspend implementation based on "security, public order, or public health" (Para. 12) creates a risk that cooperation could be halted unilaterally due to political events in either country.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **International Law Principles:** Because the MOU states that it doesn't create legally binding obligations under International Law, it is unlikely that International Law would govern any disputes, unless the specific agreements mentioned in Para 5(B) involve questions of International Law.
*   **Philippine Law:** Relevant Philippine laws might include the Intellectual Property Code (Republic Act No. 8293) and the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173). However, these laws are not directly implicated by the MOU's enforceability, but would be relevant to activities undertaken pursuant to it.
*   **Myanmar Law:** Myanmar's equivalent laws regarding intellectual property, data privacy, and media regulation would be relevant.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Mutual Benefit" (Para. 1):** Highly subjective. Difficult to quantify or enforce.
*   **"Faithfully and Professionally" (Para. 8(B)):** Vague standard for editing news and programs. Could lead to disputes regarding bias or distortion.
*   **"Reasons of security, public order or public health" (Para. 12(A)):** Broad grounds for suspension, potentially subject to abuse.

**Recommendations:**

*   Any specific arrangements (Para. 5(B)) should be drafted as legally binding contracts with clear and specific obligations, dispute resolution mechanisms, and remedies for breach.
*   Due diligence should be conducted on the IP status of all exchanged materials.
*   Consider defining "mutual benefit" in any implementing agreements.
*   Establish clear guidelines for editing news and programs to avoid disputes.

This summary provides a general overview. A full legal analysis would require further information and specific factual context.
