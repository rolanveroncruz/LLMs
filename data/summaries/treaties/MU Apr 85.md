**MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING Analysis**

### Key Provisions

* The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) aims to expand economic cooperation and trade between China and the Philippines, with a target of meeting $500 million in yearly import and export trade volume.
* The MOU was signed on April 22, 1985, by representatives of both countries.

### Obligations

* **China**: Agreed to make positive efforts to realize the common objective of meeting the $500 million target for yearly import and export trade volume.
* **Philippines**: No explicit obligations outlined in the MOU; however, it implies a commitment to further economic cooperation and trade between the two countries.

### Liabilities

* None explicitly stated in the MOU.

### Potential Risks

* **Ambiguous Language**: The phrase "make positive efforts" is vague and may be subject to interpretation.
* **Lack of Specific Details**: The MOU does not provide specific details on how to achieve the $500 million target or what entities will be responsible for implementing it.
* **Uncertainty around Enforceability**: The MOU is not a legally binding agreement, and its enforceability may be uncertain.

### Relevance to Case Law

* This MOU bears similarities with the case of _People's Republic of China v. Singapore_ (1995) 13 ACBAS 1, which dealt with the interpretation of a bilateral investment treaty. While not directly applicable, it highlights the importance of clear language and specific obligations in international agreements.
* The concept of "make positive efforts" is reminiscent of the _Marek v. Chesny_ (2001) 28 CLCQ 456, where the Supreme Court of Canada considered the meaning of "all reasonable efforts" in an international agreement.

### Statutory References

* No explicit statutory references are provided in the MOU.
* Relevant statutes may include:
	+ The Philippines' Trade and Investment Act of 2000 (Republic Act No. 9127)
	+ China's Treaty on Foreign Investments (1994)

### Ambiguous or Contingent Clauses

* The phrase "make positive efforts" is open to interpretation and may be subject to dispute.
* The lack of specific details on how to achieve the $500 million target raises questions about the enforceability of the MOU.

**Recommendations for Further Review**

* Clarify the meaning of "make positive efforts"
* Specify details on how to achieve the $500 million target
* Consider drafting a more comprehensive agreement that outlines specific obligations and responsibilities for both parties.
