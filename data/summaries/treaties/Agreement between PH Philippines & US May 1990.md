The agreement outlines priorities for hospitalization and treatment of eligible veterans, as well as provisions for cooperation and coordination between the two governments.

	+ 3rd priority: Commonwealth Army veterans with wartime service
* Section (b) lists the forms and notices required for the program, as well as the procedure for approving them.
* Section (c) outlines the inspection rights of the United States government over hospitals and nursing home care facilities.
* Section (d) provides for the allocation of unobligated funds to support equipment replacement and rehabilitation of the Veterans Memorial Medical Center.
* Section (e) stipulates that consultation will be initiated if there are concerns about compliance with agreement terms.
* Section (f) sets the effective date of the agreement and specifies its duration.
* Section (g) allows either party to request revisions to the agreement.
* Section (h) provides for protection against lawsuits from Filipino officials or employees of the US Department of Veterans Affairs who may be sued while performing their duties under this agreement.
* Section (i) clarifies that the United States will continue to assume responsibilities for veterans' benefits in the Philippines, and the Philippine government will grant diplomatic immunity to US personnel.
