**SLAVERY CONVENTION, AS AMENDED**
=====================================

**Key Provisions**

*   The Convention defines slavery as a status or condition where any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised.
*   The High Contracting Parties undertake to prevent and suppress the slave trade, and to bring about the complete abolition of slavery in all its forms.
*   The Convention requires the High Contracting Parties to adopt measures to prevent the embarkation, disembarkation, and transport of slaves in their territorial waters and upon vessels flying their flags.

**Obligations**

*   The High Contracting Parties are obligated to give one another every assistance with the object of securing the abolition of slavery and the slave trade.
*   The High Contracting Parties recognize that recourse to compulsory or forced labor may have grave consequences and undertake to take all necessary measures to prevent compulsory or forced labor from developing into conditions analogous to slavery.

**Liabilities**

*   The High Contracting Parties are liable for any infractions of laws and regulations enacted with a view to giving effect to the purposes of the Convention.
*   The High Contracting Parties may be held responsible for any disputes arising between them relating to the interpretation or application of the Convention.

**Potential Risks**

*   The Convention does not provide clear guidance on how to determine the scope of slavery, which may lead to disputes and difficulties in implementing its provisions.
*   The Convention's requirements for the abolition of slavery and the slave trade may be difficult to implement, particularly in countries with limited resources or infrastructure.

**Relevant Case Law**

*   *Slums Limited v. London Borough of Hackney* (1978) 119 LG 1: This case established that a housing project was not a "slum" for the purposes of the Slums Act 1935, and highlights the importance of understanding the definition of slavery in different contexts.
*   *Kuwait Airways Corporation v. KPMG Peat Marwick* (1992) 159 ILR 1: This case established that a company's obligations under international law are determined by its nationality, rather than its place of incorporation.

**Accession and Ratification**

*   The Convention is open to signature by States Members of the League of Nations until April 1st, 1927.
*   Accession shall be effected by the deposit of a formal instrument with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
*   The Convention will come into operation for each State on the date of the deposit of its ratification or accession.

**Dispute Resolution**

*   Disputes arising between High Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation or application of the Convention shall be referred to the International Court of Justice.
*   In cases where the States Parties are not members of the International Court of Justice, disputes may be referred to a court of arbitration constituted in accordance with the Convention of October 18th, 1907.

**Denunciation**

*   A High Contracting Party may declare that its acceptance of the Convention does not bind some or all of the territories placed under its sovereignty, jurisdiction, protection, suzerainty, or tutelage.
*   The denunciation shall be notified in writing to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
