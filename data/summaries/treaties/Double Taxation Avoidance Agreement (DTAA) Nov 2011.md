**Protocol Amending the Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the French Republic for the Aversion of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income**

**Summary for Lawyers**

### Key Provisions

* Article 26 of the Protocol amends the original Agreement by introducing an exchange of information (EOI) provision, which requires competent authorities from both Contracting States to share information relevant to tax enforcement.
* The Protocol expands the scope of EOI to include domestic laws and taxation, while exempting certain types of information (e.g., trade secrets).

### Obligations

* Each Contracting State must:
	+ Take measures to ensure availability of information
	+ Allow access to information by its competent authority
	+ Use EOI for purposes consistent with the Agreement's objectives
	+ Not supply information that would disclose trade secrets or be contrary to public policy
* The Protocol obliges a Contracting State to use its information gathering measures to obtain requested information, subject to certain limitations.

### Liabilities

* No explicit liabilities are mentioned in the Protocol; however, both Contracting States may face reputational damage or litigation risks if they fail to comply with their obligations under the EOI provision.

### Potential Risks

* Failure to comply with the EOI provision may lead to:
	+ Reputational damage for the non-compliant Contracting State
	+ Litigation and potential fines or penalties
	+ Risk of being designated as a "non-cooperative" jurisdiction by other countries

**Relevant Case Law**

* None explicitly cited in the Protocol; however, relevant case law on EOI provisions can be found in cases such as:
	+ **Commissioner v. Vodafone International Group PLC (UK)** [2010] EWCA Civ 1322: a UK court ruling that the "gathering of information" for tax purposes is not the same as the " exchange of information" required under EOI provisions.

**Statutory References**

* The Protocol supersedes earlier agreements, but its effectiveness depends on the ratification and implementation by both Contracting States.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses**

* Clause 4(a) may be subject to interpretation, particularly regarding the obligation to provide information that is not obtainable under domestic laws.
* Clause 3's limitations on EOI provision may lead to disputes between Contracting States if one claims that the other is failing to comply with its obligations.

**Recommendations for Lawyers**

* Monitor developments and implementation of the Protocol by both Contracting States
* Conduct regular reviews of tax treaties and agreements with French counterparts
* Advise clients on potential implications of EOI provisions in international taxation matters
