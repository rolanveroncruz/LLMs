**Legal Document Summary: Rescheduling Agreement Between the Republic of the Philippines and CESCE (March 15, 1988)**

**Nature:** Bilateral agreement for rescheduling of the Philippines' external debt owed to CESCE, acting as agent for the Spanish Government, pursuant to a Paris Club agreement (Jan 22, 1987).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Clause I (Debts Concerned):** Applies to Philippine debts (principal and interest) resulting from commercial credits insured by CESCE, extended to or guaranteed by the Philippine government or public institutions.  The agreement only encompasses debts with original maturity exceeding one year, concluded *before* April 1, 1984, and due between January 1, 1987, and June 30, 1988 (inclusive).  Crucially, debt service under the prior 1985 agreement is *excluded*.
*   **Clause II (Terms of Rescheduling):** 100% of principal and 70% of interest due within the specified period is rescheduled.  Repayment is structured in 10 equal semi-annual installments, beginning April 1, 1993, and ending October 1, 1997 (10-year total timeframe). The remaining 30% of interest should be paid directly to creditors per original contracts.
*   **Clause III (Amount Rescheduled):** Amounts are detailed in Annexes I (Pesetas) and II (USD).  Mechanism exists for correcting errors or omissions in Annexes.
*   **Clause IV (Rate of Interest):** Peseta debts bear a fixed 12% interest rate.  USD debts bear a floating rate based on 6-month LIBOR plus 0.50%, determined semi-annually.  Fallback provisions exist if LIBOR is unavailable, involving agreement by two EEC Banks (each party designates a bank).
*   **Clause V (Past Due Interest):** Penal interest of LIBOR + 1% applies for delays exceeding 30 days in payments.
*   **Clause VI (Payments):** Payments are deemed made upon credit to CESCE's account at Banco Exterior de Espa√±a.
*   **Clause VII (Exemptions):** Payments are to be made free from Philippine taxes or withholdings.
*   **Clause VIII (Disputes):** Disputes are subject to negotiation, failing which, arbitration by the International Chamber of Commerce in Zurich. The application of the agreement shall not be suspended for a specific section in dispute.
*   **Clause IX (Modifications):** Specifically states that the agreement *does not* modify original contracts or promises, and cannot be used to justify modifications of original contracts beyond the rescheduling.
*   **Clause X (Notices):** Lists addresses for official communications.
*   **Clause XI (Effectivity):**  Requires signature and ratification by both parties, with communication of the ratification date.

**Obligations:**

*   The Philippines is obligated to make semi-annual principal and interest payments on the rescheduled debts according to the schedule in Clause II and at the interest rates in Clause IV.  The Philippines must also pay the remaining 30% interest to the creditors under the original contracts (Clause II.B).
*   CESCE is obligated to administer the rescheduled debt according to the agreement and provide notice of any inaccuracies in the annexes. CESCE, through the designated EEC banks, must assist in setting the interest rate if the Libor rate is no longer published.

**Liabilities:**

*   Failure to make timely payments triggers default interest (Clause V).
*   The Republic of the Philippines remains liable for the full amount of the original debt, except as modified by the rescheduling agreement.
*   Potential liability for costs associated with arbitration.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Clarity of "Public Institutions":** The scope of "public institutions" as debtors/guarantors under Clause I may be ambiguous and lead to disputes regarding which debts are covered. Definition will be fact-dependent, based on ownership and control.
*   **LIBOR Replacement:** The LIBOR replacement mechanism (Clause IV) could be contentious. The EEC bank agreement process leaves room for disagreement on rate determination. Reference to the *Financial Times* publication of LIBOR and the selection process of the average rate determined by the two designated EEC banks will be an area of potential litigation.
*   **Impact of "original contracts" Modification provision (Clause IX):**  While seemingly straightforward, the interplay between the rescheduling agreement and the "original contracts" might become problematic if the original contracts contain provisions that conflict with or are not explicitly addressed in the rescheduling agreement. Courts may need to interpret the intent of the parties in such cases.
*   **Enforceability:** While the agreement provides for arbitration in Zurich, enforcing an arbitral award against a sovereign nation can be challenging and require reliance on international law principles.
*   **Annex Discrepancies:** The acknowledgment of potential errors/omissions in Annexes I & II creates uncertainty. Litigation could arise concerning the "erroneous evaluation or omission" of figures. The parties must document and clearly communicate such changes to prevent any future disputes.
*   **Sovereign Immunity:** While waived through agreement to arbitration, sovereign immunity could still be raised as a defense in enforcement proceedings in some jurisdictions.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   Philippine law on contracts and obligations (Civil Code of the Philippines).
*   International law principles regarding sovereign debt and state succession.
*   New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (applicable if enforcement is sought in a jurisdiction that is a signatory).
*   Relevant case law on interpretation of debt rescheduling agreements and *pari passu* clauses.

**Next Steps:**

*   Review the original commercial credit agreements referenced in Annexes I and II.
*   Ascertain the current status of the debts, including any payments made and outstanding balances.
*   Assess the creditworthiness of the Republic of the Philippines and its ability to meet its obligations under the rescheduled agreement.
*   Evaluate the legal and practical implications of the arbitration clause and potential enforcement challenges.
*   Consider the possibility of renegotiating the terms of the agreement to address any ambiguities or concerns.
