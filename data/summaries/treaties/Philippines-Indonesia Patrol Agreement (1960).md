**Memorandum Regarding RP-Indonesia Agreement Concerning Law Enforcement Coordination (July 27, 1960)**

**Subject:** Analysis of the 1960 RP-Indonesia Agreement on Coordination and Liaison by Law Enforcement Agencies Patrolling Shared Waters.

**Summary:**
This document comprises an exchange of diplomatic notes (July 27, 1960) between the Philippines and Indonesia, constituting an agreement for the coordination and liaison of their respective law enforcement agencies operating in the waters between the two countries. The substantive details of the coordination are contained in Annex A (not provided, and therefore a significant information gap). The agreement states that the provisions in Annex A are acceptable as a basis of agreement.

**Key Provisions:**
*   **Basis of Agreement:** Establishes Annex A (missing) as the foundation for coordinating law enforcement activities in the shared waters.
*   **Scope:** Coordination and liaison between law enforcement agencies.
*   **Implementation:** Further details beyond Annex A are subject to future agreements between the relevant law enforcement agencies of both governments.

**Obligations:**
*   The primary obligation is to coordinate and liaise law enforcement activities based on the yet unseen details of Annex A.
*   Implied obligation to negotiate in good faith any further agreements necessary for practical implementation, but without detailed obligations.

**Liabilities:**
*   The agreement itself does not explicitly create liability clauses. Liability for specific law enforcement actions would be governed by relevant domestic laws of each nation and applicable international law.
*   Potential for dispute arises from the interpretation and implementation of Annex A, if any actions are taken that can be deemed not within the scope of Annex A.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**
*   **Missing Annex A:** The complete absence of Annex A is the most significant risk. Without it, the entire agreement lacks concrete substance and enforceability. The core obligations cannot be properly assessed without knowing what's in Annex A.
*   **Vague Scope:** The scope of "coordination and liaison" is broad and undefined in the notes. Without further definition in Annex A, disputes could arise over the extent of permitted cooperation (e.g., joint patrols, information sharing, arrest powers).
*   **Future Agreements:** Reliance on future agreements between law enforcement agencies introduces uncertainty. If those agencies fail to reach consensus, implementation could be stalled.
*   **Lack of Enforcement Mechanism:** The agreement lacks a specific dispute resolution mechanism. Disputes would likely be resolved through diplomatic channels or international law, depending on the nature of the conflict.
*   **Supersession:** There is no clause addressing whether and under what circumstances the agreement might be superseded by subsequent treaties or agreements.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**
*   **Treaty Law:** The agreement is governed by the principles of treaty law under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), particularly regarding interpretation, validity, and termination.
*   **Sovereign Immunity:** Both nations retain sovereign immunity, which may limit liability for certain actions of their law enforcement agencies.
*   **Domestic Law:** The specific powers and limitations of law enforcement agencies in each country are governed by their respective domestic laws.

**Contentious Clauses/Areas of Concern:**
*   The agreement might be deemed unenforceable due to the ambiguity caused by the missing Annex A.
*   Any future agreements need to align with international law to avoid potential breach of international law obligations.

**Recommendations:**
*   Locate and analyze Annex A to understand the agreement's substantive provisions.
*   Clarify the precise scope of "coordination and liaison" through subsequent agreements or memoranda of understanding.
*   Establish a clear dispute resolution mechanism.
*   Ensure consistency with international law, especially regarding maritime boundaries, law of the sea (UNCLOS), and human rights.
*   Consider whether the agreement needs updating or replacement to reflect current geopolitical realities and legal developments.

This analysis is preliminary and subject to further refinement upon review of Annex A and related documents.
