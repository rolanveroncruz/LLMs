3. **Searches and Seizures**: Philippine authorities will not exercise the right to search, seize, or inspect U.S. property or persons without consent from U.S. authorities.
4. **Confinement and Detention**: Confined personnel will be held in facilities agreed upon by both governments, with U.S. authorities authorized to visit, provide care, and arrange for medical treatment.
5. **Criminal Jurisdiction Implementation Committee**: A committee will be established for consultation on matters requiring mutual coordination in implementing the agreement.

**Key Principles**:

* Mutual cooperation and coordination
* Respect for each other's jurisdiction over certain offenses (e.g., crimes committed within U.S. bases)
* Fair and equitable treatment of personnel and dependents from both countries

Overall, this article aims to establish a clear framework for cooperation and mutual respect in the exercise of jurisdiction between the United States and the Philippines in cases involving offenses committed on their respective territories.
