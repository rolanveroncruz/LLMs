This is the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) treaty, signed on September 8, 1954, in Manila, Philippines. The treaty established a collective defense alliance among the signatory countries to counter the spread of communism in Southeast Asia.

The treaty was signed by seven countries:

1. Australia
2. France
3. New Zealand
4. Pakistan (represented by Zafarulla Khan)
5. The Republic of the Philippines (represented by Carlos P. Garcia, Francisco A. Delgado, Tomas L. Cabili, Lorenzo M. Tanada, Cornelio T. Villareal, and others)
6. The Kingdom of Thailand (represented by Wan Waithayakon Krommun Naradhip Bongsprabandh)
7. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (represented by Reading)
8. The United States of America (represented by John Foster Dulles, H. Alexander Smith, Michael J. Mansfield)

The treaty consisted of 12 articles, which dealt with various aspects of the alliance, including:

* Collective defense: Article I established the principles of collective defense and cooperation among the signatory countries.
* Recognition of aggression: Article IV recognized the effects of communist aggression and armed attack.
* Economic measures: Article III authorized economic measures to be taken against countries that are responsible for acts contrary to the principles of the alliance.

The treaty also included a protocol, which designated Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam as eligible for collective defense cooperation under Article IV.

SEATO was seen as a counterbalance to the Soviet Union's influence in Southeast Asia during the Cold War era. However, the organization collapsed after the United States withdrew from it in 1977, following the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War.
