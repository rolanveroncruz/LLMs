**Obligations:**

*   **European Community:** Provide the committed financial contribution subject to Philippines' compliance and admissible payment requests.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Philippines:** Responsible for delays in forwarding payment requests, which may result in liability for late-payment interest under contracts. Responsible for failure to meet the eligibility requirements set forth in the Financing Agreement.
*   **Both Parties:** Potential for suspension or termination of the agreement due to breach of obligations, force majeure, or failure to resolve issues leading to suspension.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Strict Deadlines:** The absolute deadline for contract signing (Article 5) presents a significant risk if project implementation is delayed.
*   **Article 6 Compliance:** Maintaining continuous compliance with the strict management system criteria outlined in Article 6 is critical. Failure can trigger suspension or centralized management by the Commission.
*   **"Decentralised Management" ambiguity:** No further definition of "Decentralised management" is given other than what is stated in Article 6.2.
*   **Procurement Procedures:** Adherence to the Commission's procurement procedures (Article 7, General Conditions) is essential. Non-compliance can lead to challenges.
*   **Amendment Process:** Amendments require agreement by both parties and can be time-consuming (Article 20).
*   **Dispute Resolution:** Arbitration process (Article 23, General Conditions) could be lengthy and costly.
*   **Suspension and Termination:** Potential for suspension or termination due to breach of obligations, human rights violations, or corruption (Articles 21 and 22, General Conditions).
*   **Force Majeure:** The definition of force majeure is narrow, and certain events like financial difficulties or labor disputes are explicitly excluded.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Community Law:** Compliance with relevant Community rules and procedures is mandated throughout the agreement, especially regarding eligibility of expenditure.
*   **OLAF & Court of Auditors:** Articles 17 and 18 of Annex I refer to European Union legislation and regulations related to the protection of financial interests, prevention of fraud, and auditing powers of these bodies.
*   **Annex 1, Article 7**: All contracts implementing the financing agreement must be awarded and implemented in accordance with the procedures and standard documents laid down and published by the Commission for the implementation of external operations, in force at the time of the launch of the procedure in question.
