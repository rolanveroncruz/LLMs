This is not a law or an agreement, but rather a document that outlines the terms of a trade agreement between the Philippines and the United States. Specifically, it appears to be a Philippine legislative act that authorizes the President of the Philippines to enter into a revised trade agreement with the United States.

The document explains that:

* The Philippines has the authority to conclude an agreement with the US on the basis of the Final Act of Negotiations signed in 1954.
* The text of the revised agreement can be modified, but only for minor errors or changes in style/form, and not for significant changes.
* If a revised agreement is concluded before January 1, 1956, the President must proclaim it, and it will be effective in accordance with its terms.

The document also defines key terms, such as:

* "United States articles" refers to articles produced in the US that are eligible for Philippine tariff preferences.
* "Philippine article" refers to an article produced in the Philippines that is eligible for US tariff preferences if certain conditions are met.
* "Value" is defined as the value of an imported material or article, including costs and customs duties.

Overall, this document appears to be a formal legislative act that outlines the terms and procedures for revising a trade agreement between the Philippines and the United States.
