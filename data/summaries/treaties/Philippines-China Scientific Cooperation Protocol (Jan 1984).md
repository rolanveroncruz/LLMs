Okay, here's a summary of the provided "PROTOCOL OF THE SIXTH SESSION ON SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA" for a lawyer, formatted in Markdown:

**Document Summary: 1984 Philippine-China Scientific and Technical Cooperation Protocol**

This document is the Protocol of the Sixth Session on Scientific and Technical Cooperation between the Philippines and China, signed January 10, 1984, pursuant to the 1978 Agreement on Scientific and Technical Cooperation between the two countries. It outlines the agreed-upon scientific and technical cooperation program for the year 1984.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Project Implementation:** China agrees to undertake Philippine projects as outlined in Annex II. The Philippines agrees to undertake Chinese projects as outlined in Annex III. Annexes I, II and III are integral parts of this Protocol.
*   **Financial Responsibilities:** The sending party of study groups bears travel expenses *to* the receiving country. The receiving party bears expenses for food, accommodation, medical care, and internal transport.
*   **Exchange of Materials and Data:** Seeds, seedlings, fish fries, specimens, technical information, and data are to be exchanged free of charge and delivered to the receiving party's embassy with relevant transfer documents.
*   **Amendments/Additions:** Allows for additional projects/activities to be added by mutual agreement through diplomatic channels during the 1984 program year and incorporated into the next protocol.
*   **Future Meetings:** The Seventh Session is scheduled for the first half of 1985 in Manila, date to be set diplomatically.

**Obligations:**

*   Each party is obligated to implement the projects/activities outlined in Annexes II & III respectively.
*   Both parties are obligated to cover costs according to the established financial responsibilities for study groups.
*   Both parties are obligated to facilitate the free exchange of materials/data, ensuring proper delivery and documentation.
*   Each party may consider projects and/or activity proposals on scientific and technical cooperation from the other party.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Breach of Contract:** Failure to implement agreed-upon projects/activities in Annexes II & III could constitute a breach.  Damages would likely be limited to direct losses resulting from the non-performance (e.g., costs incurred in anticipation of the cooperation).
*   **Liability for Damages:**  While medical care is covered for study groups by the receiving party, the Protocol does *not* address liability for injuries, damages, or losses caused *by* study groups or the materials exchanged. Consider potential issues of product liability or negligence.
*   **Ambiguity:**  The definitions of "study groups," "technical information," and "data" are not explicitly defined, potentially leading to disputes over the scope of the agreement. The precise nature and extent of "medical care" is also undefined.
*   **Intellectual Property:** There is no explicit provision addressing intellectual property rights related to information, data, or materials exchanged or developed as part of the cooperative projects. This could lead to disputes regarding ownership and usage rights.
*   **Sovereign Immunity:** Both parties are governments, raising the possibility of sovereign immunity defenses in any potential disputes.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Treaty Interpretation:**  International law principles of treaty interpretation, as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (if both states are parties), will govern interpretation of the Protocol. Principles include good faith, ordinary meaning, and considering the object and purpose of the treaty.
*   **Sovereign Immunity:** Refer to the relevant laws of both the Philippines and China concerning sovereign immunity, potentially limiting legal recourse. In the US, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) might provide guidance on sovereign immunity issues, although the Protocol is not governed by US Law.
*   **Breach of Contract:** Domestic contract law principles within the Philippines or China might be relevant to determine the remedies for breach of specific provisions of the Protocol (depending on the chosen forum for dispute resolution, if any).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The lack of a dispute resolution mechanism is a significant omission.  How disputes are resolved (e.g., through diplomatic channels, arbitration, litigation) is unclear.
*   The absence of provisions addressing intellectual property ownership and licensing poses a significant risk, especially concerning commercially valuable research outputs.
*   The scope of "medical care" to be provided to study groups is vague and could be subject to varying interpretations.
* The absence of a clause that deals with unforseen circumstances.

**Further Investigation:**

*   Review Annexes II and III to determine the specific projects and activities agreed upon.
*   Research relevant laws regarding sovereign immunity in both the Philippines and China.
*   Clarify whether the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties applies to both countries.
* Investigate and research the original intention of each party in the agreement and the understanding of provisions.

This summary provides a basis for further legal analysis and due diligence. It is not a substitute for a complete review of the entire document and relevant legal research.
