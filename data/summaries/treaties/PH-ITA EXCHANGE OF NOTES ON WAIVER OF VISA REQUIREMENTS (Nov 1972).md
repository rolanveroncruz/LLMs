### Summary

    *   "Service" passports issued by the Italian authorities (for Philippine nationals)
    *   Passports of "Career Officers of International Organizations"
*   **Indefinite Duration**: The waiver is effective indefinitely, subject to termination by written notification from one party to the other.

### Obligations and Liabilities

*   **Philippine Government Obligation**: Not require visa for holders of diplomatic and service passports issued by Italian authorities.
*   **Italian Government Obligation**: Not require visa for holders of diplomatic and official passports issued by Philippine authorities.
*   **Liability**: Neither party is liable for non-compliance with the waiver, unless written notification is provided.

### Potential Risks

*   **Ambiguity in Termination Clause**: The 90-day notice period may be open to interpretation, potentially leading to disputes between the parties.
*   **Enforcement Mechanisms**: There are no specific provisions for enforcement of the agreement, leaving it to diplomatic efforts to resolve any disputes that may arise.

### Relevant Case Law and Statutory References

### Conclusion

However, its implementation and enforcement may be subject to challenges, particularly with regard to the termination clause and potential disputes that may arise.
