The text appears to be a draft or original version of the Prek Thnot Irrigation Development Project Agreement, which was signed on November 13, 1968. The agreement is between Australia and Cambodia, with other countries also participating.

Here's a brief summary of the key points:

**Purpose:** The project aims to develop power and irrigation on the Prek Thnot River in Cambodia over a period of three-and-a-half years.

**Scope:**

1. Construction of an earth and rockfill regulation dam at a point approximately 70 kilometers from Phnom Penh.
2. A power station with two 9 MW turbo-generators to provide an estimated annual output of 50 million kWh in rainy years and 28 million kWh in dry years.
3. A diversion weir to be constructed approximately 12 kilometers downstream from the storage dam.
4. An irrigation system to provide water for approximately 5,000 hectares on the left bank of the river.

**Estimated costs:**

* Total cost: US$27 million (equivalent to approximately $225 million in today's currency)
* Foreign exchange requirement: US$18 million

**Entry into force:** The agreement entered into force on November 13, 1968, once all participating countries had signed it.
