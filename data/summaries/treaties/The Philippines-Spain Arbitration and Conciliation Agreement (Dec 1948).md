This is a translation of an 1899 treaty between the Philippines and Spain regarding arbitration and conciliation. The document outlines the procedures and rules for the Conciliation Commission and the Arbitration Court established under the Treaty of Friendship between the Philippines and Spain.

Here's a summary of the key points:

**Arbitration Procedure**

* The procedure consists of two phases: pleadings and oral discussions.
* Parties must communicate their claims, counterclaims, and replies to each other and to the court within a specified time frame.
* The parties are required to provide full information and documents related to the case.

**Award**

* The award must be in writing and give reasons for its decision.
* Arbitrators who do not concur with the majority opinion must write their dissenting opinions.
* All decisions of the Arbitration Court must be made by a majority of at least three members unless agreed otherwise.

**Revision**

* Revision can only be made before the court that pronounced the award, based on new facts that were unknown at the time of the discussion.
* The demand for revision must be made within a specified period, and the "Compromis" will determine the deadline.

**Rules Applicable to Both Commission and Court**

* Members of the Permanent Conciliation Commission and Arbitration Court cannot act as agents, counsels, or advocates for either party.
* Parties in dispute or their representatives are prohibited from performing acts that may hinder or delay the acceptance of the conciliation commission's proposal or the execution of the award.

**Expenses and Compensation**

* Each party is responsible for its own expenses and those of the commission and court.
* The amount of compensation and allowances for commission and court members will be determined by mutual agreement between both countries.

The treaty confirms that the proposed regulations regarding substitution, powers, operation, and procedures of the Conciliation Commission and Arbitration Court are acceptable to the Philippine Government and take effect as of the date of this note.
