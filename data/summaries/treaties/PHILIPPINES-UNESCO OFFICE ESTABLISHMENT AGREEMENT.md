This is a copy of an exchange of notes between the International Secretariat for Volunteer Service (ISVS) and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, dated December 23, 1970. The note appears to be a revised agreement between ISVS and the Philippine government regarding the establishment of an Asian Regional Office of ISVS in Manila.

The agreement includes provisions on the functions of the regional office, including:

* Providing regional leadership in stimulating and developing volunteerism
* Promoting the establishment and strengthening of national coordinating councils in every member country
* Operating as a clearing house for requests for and offers of volunteers
* Establishing a system of collection, collation, and dissemination of information materials
* Maintaining a roster of personnel and institutional resources available for training in the region

The agreement also includes provisions on immunities and facilities for officials of ISVS, including exemptions from prosecution and privileges such as diplomatic immunity.

The exchange of notes includes a mutual understanding between ISVS and the Philippine government that the revised agreement would replace an earlier exchange of notes dated February 2, 1968. The agreement is proposed to enter into force on the date of the Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs' reply note.

The note confirms the mutual understanding set forth in the previous notes, with the Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs confirming that his government accepts the revised agreement and assuring ISVS of its highest consideration.

Overall, this exchange of notes appears to be a formal agreement between ISVS and the Philippine government regarding the establishment of an Asian Regional Office of ISVS and the terms and conditions of their cooperation.
