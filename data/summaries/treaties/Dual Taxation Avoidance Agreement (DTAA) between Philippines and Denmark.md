This is a tax treaty between the Philippines and Denmark, also known as a Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation. The treaty aims to prevent double taxation on income and capital, as well as fiscal evasion.

Here are some key points from the treaty:

1. **Mutual Assistance in Collection**: The treaty allows for mutual assistance in collecting taxes owed by taxpayers to each other's countries.
2. **Assistance with Tax Credits**: Each country will allow the other country to credit its tax credits against its own tax liability.
3. **Exemption from Taxation**: Certain income and capital gains are exempt from taxation, such as:
	* Gains derived from the sale of shares or other securities
	* Interest and dividends on investments
	* Royalties on intellectual property
4. **Tax Spreads**: The treaty provides for tax spreads, which allow taxpayers to transfer their tax liability between countries.
5. **Territorial Extension**: The treaty can be extended to specific territories, such as special economic zones or territories with similar taxation systems.

The treaty also includes provisions related to:

1. **Exchange of Information**: Each country will provide the other with information about taxpayers, including financial statements and tax returns.
2. **Fiscal Privileges**: Diplomatic missions and consular posts are exempt from taxation on certain income and privileges.
3. **Procedure for Termination**: Either country can terminate the treaty by giving notice at least six months before the end of any calendar year.

The treaty entered into force on January 1, 1996, and has been ratified by both countries.
