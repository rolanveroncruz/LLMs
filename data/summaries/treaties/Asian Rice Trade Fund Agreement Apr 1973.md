This is a draft agreement establishing the Asian Rice Trade Fund, which was proposed in 1973 and opened for signature on April 16, 1974. The agreement outlines the terms and conditions under which the fund would operate, including its purpose, governance structure, and procedures for determining liability of members, payment of claims, and distribution of assets.

Here are some key provisions of the agreement:

1. **Purpose**: The Asian Rice Trade Fund was established to promote cooperation among member countries in the field of rice trade.
2. **Governance**: The fund would be governed by a Board of Directors composed of two directors from each member country.
3. **Membership**: Membership was open to governments, international organizations, and private companies engaged in rice trade.
4. **Funding**: The fund would be funded through contributions from member countries, which would vary depending on the level of participation.
5. **Operations**: The fund would operate through a network of regional offices and field offices, with an Executive Secretary appointed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.

The agreement also includes provisions for:

1. **Interpretation and application**: Any disputes or questions arising from the interpretation or application of the agreement would be submitted to the Board of Directors for decision.
2. **Arbitration**: Disputes between the fund and a member country, or between two or more member countries, would be resolved through arbitration by a tribunal of three arbitrators.
3. **Acceptance**: The agreement was subject to acceptance by member countries in accordance with their respective constitutional procedures.
4. **Entry into force**: The agreement would enter into force when not less than three member countries had deposited instruments of acceptance.

The agreement was signed by representatives of eight countries: the Khmer Republic, the Philippines, the People's Republic of Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Malaysia.

It is worth noting that this agreement was never fully ratified or implemented due to various reasons, including political tensions and disputes among member countries.
