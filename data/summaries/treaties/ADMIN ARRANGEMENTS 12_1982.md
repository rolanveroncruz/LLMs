This is a diplomatic note between the Philippines and the United States, dated December 8, 1982. The note confirms the implementation of administrative arrangements for customs, immigration, and quarantine at Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base in the Philippines.

The agreement includes:

1. The U.S. facilities will be designated as limited ports of entry/exit.
2. The Republic of the Philippines will no longer require diplomatic clearance for U.S. Military Airlift Command (MAC) contract aircraft flights arriving at Clark and Subic bases.
3. Categories of personnel permitted to enter or exit the Philippines through these airports have been defined.

The note also includes a proposal that both notes, which define the categories of personnel who may utilize the limited ports of entry at Clark and Subic bases, shall serve as evidence of the agreement's entry into force.

The response from the Philippine Minister for Foreign Affairs agrees to this proposal, confirming that the two notes will serve as proof of the agreement's implementation.

Key figures involved in this note include:

* Michael H. Armacost: Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America
* Carlos P. Romulo: Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Philippines
