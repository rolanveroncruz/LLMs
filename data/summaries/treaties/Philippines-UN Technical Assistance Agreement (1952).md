## Summary of Supplementary Agreement No. 6 (1952) - Philippines & UN Technical Assistance Board

**Core Agreement:** This Supplementary Agreement No. 6, dated April 24, 1952, supplements the Basic Agreement for Technical Assistance signed on April 5, 1951, between the Philippines and the United Nations Technical Assistance Board. It outlines specific technical assistance to be provided by the UN to the Philippine government, particularly regarding the marble industry.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Scope of Assistance (Article I):** The UN is obligated to provide one expert to supervise marble operations in Romblon and consult for the Cebu Portland Cement Company (CEPOC) for one year. It also includes three marble workers to train CEPOC employees in quarrying and fabrication. The agreement necessitates expert collaboration with CEPOC technicians and potential public/private agencies designated by the Government.  It also provides for information sharing through reports to the UN Secretary-General and potential publication of findings, subject to mutual consultation.
*   **Central Coordinating Agency (Article II):** Reinforces that all dealings related to this technical assistance shall be through the agency designated by the Philippine Government as the central coordinating agency.
*   **Government Obligations (Article III):** The Philippines is obligated to:
    *   Provide lodging for the experts (or 336 pesos/month each), with CEPOC initially providing accommodation.
    *   Provide medical care and hospitalization for experts and dependents.
    *   Furnish offices, facilities, supplies, equipment, and communications.
    *   Provide technical and secretarial assistance.
    *   Arrange transportation for official travel.
    *   Provide full subsistence for travel days.
    *   Establish a local currency fund (P46,000 total, in quarterly installments of P11,500) to cover local expenses, operated by the Resident Technical Assistance Representative. Any remaining balance upon project completion will be returned to CEPOC.
*   **Effective Date and Termination (Article IV):** The agreement became effective upon signature. It can be modified by agreement or terminated by either party with 60 days written notice.

**Obligations:**

*   **UN:** Provide specified experts and trainers for the designated duration and to ensure proper reporting.
*   **Philippines:** Provide logistical support, financial resources, and a coordinating agency as outlined in Article III.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Scope of Work:** The lack of detail regarding the "supervision" and "consulting" roles could lead to disputes over the experts' responsibilities. A lawyer should investigate whether this clause is sufficient to define the scope of the work.
*   **Funding:** The agreement stipulates a specific funding amount (P46,000) and payment schedule. If actual expenses exceed this amount, there is a mechanism for further funds through an agreement with CEPOC. However, the agreement does not specify what happens if CEPOC is unwilling or unable to provide additional funds.
*   **Termination:** The termination clause is relatively straightforward but could be invoked if either party is dissatisfied with the progress or performance. This could leave CEPOC without the necessary expertise to develop the marble industry, or leave the UN liable for unfulfilled contractual obligations.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** The agreement does not specify a method for resolving disputes between the parties. This omission could lead to lengthy and costly litigation if disputes arise.
*   **Force Majeure:** The document lacks any explicit force majeure clause. What if the marble industry is unable to perform at its regular capacity due to natural disasters or other events?

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Basic Agreement for Technical Assistance (April 5, 1951):** The Supplementary Agreement is subordinate to this Basic Agreement, so its provisions are incorporated by reference.
*   **DFA TS No. 1, p. 72 (II):** Should be referenced for further context on the Basic Agreement's interpretation and the overall framework of technical assistance agreements between the Philippines and the UN.
*   **General Principles of Contract Law (Philippines):** Governs interpretation and enforcement, including issues of offer, acceptance, consideration, and breach.
*   **Relevant Provisions of the UN Charter:** Depending on the overall legal framework established by the Basic Agreement and the UN Charter, these principles can be useful in dispute resolution.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Supervise all operations":** The ambiguity of this phrase could lead to disagreements about the extent of the expert's authority and responsibility.
*   **"Mutual consultation" before publication:** Lack of definition of "mutual consultation."

**Overall Legal Opinion:**

While the agreement appears straightforward on its face, the ambiguity in certain clauses and the potential for unforeseen circumstances could create legal risks. A lawyer would advise on clarifying the scope of work, adding a more robust dispute resolution mechanism, and adding a force majeure clause. Given the date of the agreement, its continued relevance and applicability would also need to be considered in the context of current Philippine law and international agreements.
