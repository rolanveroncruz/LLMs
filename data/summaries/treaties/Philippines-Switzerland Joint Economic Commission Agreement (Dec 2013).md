## Summary of the RP-Swiss Confederation Joint Economic Commission Agreement

**Document:** Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the Swiss Confederation Establishing a Joint Economic Commission (Dated June 28, 2013, Effective Dec 19, 2013)

**Purpose:** Establishes a Philippine-Swiss Joint Economic Commission (the "Commission") to enhance bilateral trade and investment, improve the business environment, and promote economic cooperation.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I: Establishment:** Formally creates the Commission.
*   **Article II: Objectives:** Defines the Commission's objectives, including:
    *   Increasing bilateral trade and investment.
    *   Facilitating trade and investment.
    *   Examining opportunities for economic agreements.
    *   Organizing consultations and visits.
    *   Establishing data exchange mechanisms.
    *   Enhancing cooperation with business associations.
    *   Addressing relevant economic and trade issues.
*   **Article III: Organization:** Co-chaired by representatives of the Philippine Department of Trade and Industry and the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research. Allows for participation of other governmental and private sector representatives.
*   **Article IV: Procedures:** Sets out meeting schedules, requires joint minutes and work programs, and allows for the establishment of working groups on specific issues.
*   **Article V: Relations with the Private Sector:** Emphasizes close collaboration with the private sector and encourages their participation in Commission activities and working groups.
*   **Article VI: Final Clauses:**
    *   *International Obligations:* Explicitly states that the agreement shall not lead to any measures inconsistent with international obligations (e.g., WTO obligations).
    *   *Financial Obligations:* States that the agreement does not create any financial obligations for either party or the participants.
    *   *Entry into Force:* Entered into force upon later notification of fulfilment of domestic requirements by both parties.
    *   *Amendment/Revision:* Allows for amendment or revision by mutual consent.
    *   *Termination:* Allows either party to terminate with six months' notice.

**Obligations:**

*   **Parties' Obligations:** To actively participate in the Commission, fulfill the objectives outlined in Article II, and adhere to the procedures set forth in Article IV.
*   **Co-Chairs Obligations:** To organize the meetings and determine the representatives from the governmental and private sectors.
*   **Private Sector Obligations:** If participating, to provide advice, assistance, and cooperation to the commission.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Limited Liability:** Article VI explicitly states that the agreement creates *no financial obligations* for either party. Therefore, no direct financial liability arises from this agreement itself. However, subsequent agreements or actions arising *from* the Commission's work may create liabilities, which would need separate analysis. The liability would depend on other executed, legally binding agreements and subject to local jurisprudence.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Enforcement Mechanism:** The agreement lacks a specific enforcement mechanism for non-compliance with its objectives or procedures. This could result in the Commission being ineffective if either party fails to actively participate or fulfill its objectives. The effectiveness relies on the parties' good faith and political will.
*   **Vague Objectives:** Some objectives (e.g., "facilitating trade and investment") are broadly worded. This may lead to disagreements on the scope and implementation of these objectives.
*   **WTO Compliance:** While Article VI attempts to ensure compliance with international obligations, future actions taken as a result of the Commission's recommendations could potentially violate WTO agreements or other trade agreements. A thorough legal review would be required before implementing any such actions.
*   **Dependence on Political Will:** The success of the Commission hinges on the continued political will and commitment of both governments. A change in government or policy could lead to a diminished interest in the Commission, rendering it ineffective.
*   **Disputes on Private Sector Influence:** Differences in approach on involvement of the private sector may result in some disputes.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **WTO Agreements:**  The agreement references the WTO Agreement, implying the need for any actions taken under this agreement to comply with WTO rules, specifically the principles of non-discrimination (Most Favored Nation and National Treatment).
*   **National Laws & Regulations:** The entry-into-force provision (Art. VI, para. 2) refers to each party's domestic requirements. This implies compliance with each country's laws regarding treaty ratification or implementation.  Philippine laws regarding treaty ratification (e.g., Senate concurrence) would be relevant. Swiss federal laws regarding international agreements would also apply.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Facilitate trade and investment":** The scope and meaning of "facilitate" are not clearly defined. This could lead to disputes regarding what actions are considered appropriate or necessary for facilitation.
*   **"Raise at any time any economic and trade issues":** This broadly worded clause could potentially lead to the Commission being burdened with issues outside its intended scope.

**Conclusion:**

The RP-Swiss Joint Economic Commission Agreement is a framework agreement intended to foster economic cooperation. It creates a platform for dialogue and information exchange. However, its effectiveness relies heavily on the parties' commitment and good faith.  The lack of a strong enforcement mechanism and the broadly worded objectives create potential risks. Any specific actions taken as a result of the Commission's recommendations should be subject to careful legal review, particularly with regard to WTO compliance and potential impacts on domestic law.
