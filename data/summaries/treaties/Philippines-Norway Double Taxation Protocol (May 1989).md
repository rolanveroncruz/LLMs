**Summary of the 1989 Protocol Amending the Philippines-Norway Double Taxation Convention**

This Protocol, signed May 22, 1989, amends the 1987 Philippines-Norway Double Taxation Convention. Its primary focus is on the taxation of income derived from employment on ships and aircraft operated in international traffic and specifying the effective date of the convention.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Article I (Amendment to Article 15(3) of the Convention):** This is the core provision. It modifies the taxation rules for remuneration earned on ships and aircraft.
    *   General Rule: Income from employment aboard ships or aircraft in international traffic may be taxed in the state where the operator is a resident.
    *   Exception 1: Income from employment aboard ships registered in the *Norwegian International Ships' Register (N.I.S.)* is taxable *only* in the employee's state of residence.
    *   Exception 2: Income earned by a resident of Norway on aircraft operated in international traffic by *Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS)* is taxable *only* in Norway.
*   **Article II (Amendment to Article 29(2) of the Convention):** Modifies the entry into force and effective date of the original convention. The Convention's provisions apply to taxes on income or capital relating to the calendar year (or accounting periods beginning in such year) the Convention entered into force.
*   **Article III (Ratification and Entry into Force of the Protocol):** Requires ratification and exchange of instruments. The Protocol takes effect upon exchange of ratification instruments and applies to taxes on income or capital relating to the calendar year (including accounting periods) in which the *original* 1987 Convention entered into force.
*   **Article IV (Duration):** The Protocol remains in force as long as the underlying Convention remains in force.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Potential for Interpretation Disputes:** The precise definition of "international traffic," and the scope of "operator" could be sources of contention. Case law defining these terms in similar tax treaties (e.g., OECD Model Tax Convention commentaries) would be relevant. The protocol's silence on the definition of "international traffic" leaves room for future disputes.
*   **N.I.S. Registration Requirements:** The exemption for N.I.S. registered ships hinges on proper registration under Norwegian law. Verification of registration would be critical.
*   **SAS Operations:** The special rule for SAS relies on the consortium's structure and operational definition remaining consistent. Changes to SAS's structure could affect this provision.
*   **Effective Date Ambiguity:** Article III links the Protocol's effective date to the effective date of the *original* 1987 Convention. This may create ambiguity, especially if the 1987 convention's effective date itself was unclear or subject to dispute. Determining the correct "calendar year" will be important for application of tax law.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Domestic Tax Laws:** Philippine and Norwegian tax laws would define what constitutes taxable "income" and "capital."
*   **OECD Model Tax Convention & Commentaries:** The OECD model treaty provides interpretative guidance, although the Philippines and Norway are not strictly bound by it.
*   **Case Law on Tax Treaty Interpretation:** Principles of treaty interpretation, such as giving effect to the parties' intent and avoiding absurdity, would apply.
*   **Norwegian International Ships' Register Regulations:** The registration requirements under Norwegian law defining the N.I.S.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The lack of a definition for "international traffic"
*   Reliance on SAS consortium structure and operational practices.
*   Determining if this protocol effects income on the calendar year which the 1987 enters into force is ambiguous.
