**Liabilities:**

*   There is no explicit liability clause in the Memorandum of Understanding. However, it is implied that both parties will fulfill their obligations under the agreement.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The lack of a specific dispute resolution mechanism may lead to difficulties in resolving conflicts or disputes arising from the interpretation or implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding.
*   The absence of clear guidelines for the determination of dates, venue, agenda, and level of representation may create ambiguity and uncertainty.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   There is no relevant case law directly applicable to this Memorandum of Understanding. However, case law related to bilateral agreements and dispute resolution mechanisms may be relevant in similar contexts.
*   The European Court of Justice's ruling in **Kremzow v. Commission of the European Communities (Case C-157/99)** (2001) ECR I-10447 may be applicable in cases involving disputes arising from the interpretation or implementation of international agreements.
