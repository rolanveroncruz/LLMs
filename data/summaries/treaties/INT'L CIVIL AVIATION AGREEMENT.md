This is a copy of the text of the Chicago Convention, also known as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Convention, which is the founding treaty of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The convention was signed on December 7, 1944, at the International Civil Aviation Conference in Chicago, and it came into force on June 6, 1945.

The Chicago Convention established the ICAO and created a framework for international civil aviation cooperation. It sets out the principles and rules for air navigation, air transport, and other aspects of international civil aviation.

Here is a brief summary of the key articles:

1. Article III: Financial Statements - Requires member states to submit financial statements to the ICAO.
2. Article XIV: Withdrawal - Allows member states to withdraw from the convention with six months' notice.
3. Article XVII: Signatures and Acceptances - Sets out the rules for signature, acceptance, and ratification of the convention.
4. Article XVI: Election of First Interim Council - Establishes the first interim council of ICAO and its composition.
5. Article XIV: Definitions - Defines key terms such as "air service", "international air service", and "airline".

The convention has been amended several times since its adoption, with the most significant amendment being the Convention on International Civil Aviation Amendments, which was adopted in 1954.

Today, the Chicago Convention is an important treaty that underpins international civil aviation cooperation. It sets out a framework for safety, security, and efficiency in air navigation, and it provides a basis for cooperation between states on issues related to civil aviation.
