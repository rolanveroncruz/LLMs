This is the text of a Double Taxation Convention between Norway and the Philippines, specifically the provisions related to Article 7 on "Business Profits" and Article 24 on "Taxation of Capital". 

Here are some key points from the convention:

1. **Attribution of Business Profits**: The convention attributes business profits to permanent establishments in both countries.
2. **Distinguishing between Active Business Profits and Passive Income**: The convention distinguishes between active business profits, which are subject to taxation in both countries, and passive income, which is only taxed in the country where it arises.

Additionally, a protocol was signed that modified two articles of the Convention:

1. **Article 7, paragraph 1**: It now includes sales of goods or merchandise in the other country as well as profits from business activities.
2. **Article 24, paragraph 4, sub-paragraph 2**: This article states that taxes on capital paid by Norway are credited against similar taxes imposed by the Philippines.

These changes aim to clarify and expand the scope of the Convention's provisions to better reflect the complexities of international taxation.
