## Summary of RP-Mongolia Investment Treaty (Sept. 1, 2000)

**Overview:** This is a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) between the Philippines (RP) and Mongolia designed to promote and protect investments between the two countries. It establishes reciprocal obligations for the treatment and protection of investments by investors of one state within the territory of the other.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I (Definitions):** Defines key terms, including "investor" (natural persons and legal entities with real economic activity within a Contracting Party's territory) and "investments" (broadly defined to include tangible and intangible assets).  The definition of "investor" requires "real economic activities," which can be a point of contention if the investor is a shell company. The definition of "territory" of the Philippines refers to Article I of its Constitution.
*   **Article II (Scope):** Applies to investments made *before or after* the treaty's entry into force, raising potential issues of retroactivity. (See *Salini v. Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, regarding the scope of temporal application of BITs).
*   **Article III (Promotion, Admission):** Obligates each party to promote and admit investments "as far as possible" and "in accordance with its laws and regulations." This creates ambiguity as admission is not guaranteed and contingent on domestic laws.
*   **Article IV (Protection, Treatment):** Mandates "fair and equitable treatment" (FET) and most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment. The MFN clause contains exceptions for customs unions, free trade areas, and taxation agreements (Article IV(3)). FET clauses are often subject to interpretation by tribunals and have generated significant case law.
*   **Article V (Free Transfer):** Guarantees the unrestricted transfer of investment-related payments in freely convertible currency at the prevailing exchange rate. Such provisions are standard in BITs and provide investors certainty in repatriation of profits and capital.
*   **Article VI (Dispossession, Compensation):** Protects against expropriation, nationalization, or equivalent measures, absent public interest, non-discrimination, due process, and effective/adequate compensation with interest. This provision aligns with customary international law on expropriation.  The standard of compensation required, while referencing "effective and adequate", may still be subject to interpretation.
*   **Article VII (Subrogation):** Addresses the principle of subrogation when one party provides insurance or guarantees for its investors.
*   **Article VIII (Investor-State Dispute Settlement - ISDS):** Allows investors to submit disputes to domestic courts, ICSID arbitration, or *ad hoc* arbitration under UNCITRAL rules after a six-month consultation period.  This is a critical provision granting investors direct access to international arbitration.
*   **Article IX (State-State Dispute Settlement):** Provides for diplomatic negotiation followed by arbitration for disputes between the Contracting Parties regarding the interpretation or application of the treaty.
*   **Article X (Other Commitments):** Clarifies that if domestic law or international law provides more favorable treatment, those provisions prevail. It also requires parties to observe any obligations assumed with regard to investments.
*   **Article XI (Final Provisions):** Defines entry into force, duration (10 years with automatic extension), and termination. Investments made before termination are protected for an additional 10 years.

**Obligations:**

*   **Promote and Admit Investments:** Each party must promote investments by investors of the other party, subject to domestic laws.
*   **Protect Investments:** Each party must protect investments from unreasonable or discriminatory measures.
*   **Ensure Fair Treatment:** Investments must receive fair and equitable treatment and MFN treatment.
*   **Allow Free Transfer of Funds:** Parties must allow the unrestricted transfer of investment-related payments.
*   **Provide Compensation for Expropriation:** Expropriation requires due process and effective and adequate compensation.
*   **Abide by Dispute Settlement Provisions:** Parties must adhere to the ISDS and state-state dispute settlement mechanisms.

**Liabilities:**

*   Liability for breach of treaty obligations, including unfair treatment, discriminatory measures, or unlawful expropriation.
*   Potential liability for monetary damages awarded by arbitral tribunals.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Broad Definition of "Investment":** Could encompass activities not traditionally considered foreign investment.
*   **Ambiguity in "Fair and Equitable Treatment":** Subject to evolving interpretation by arbitral tribunals, potentially leading to unexpected liabilities. *See, e.g., Tecmed v. Mexico*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2.
*   **Retroactivity (Article II):** Could create liability for pre-existing measures.
*   **Discretion in Admission (Article III):** Limits the enforceability of the promotion obligation.
*   **State's Sovereign Right to regulate for legitimate public interest (Article VI) leading to dispute on whether it is legitimate public interest versus expropriation. See *Police Power* doctrines.**
*   **Political Risks:** Changes in domestic law or policy that could negatively impact investments.
*   **Enforcement:** Enforcing arbitral awards can be challenging.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Philippine Constitution, Article I:** Defines the national territory of the Philippines.
*   **Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID Convention):** Provides the framework for ICSID arbitration.
*   **UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules:** Applicable to *ad hoc* arbitrations.
*   Relevant jurisprudence interpreting FET standards, expropriation, and MFN clauses in BITs (e.g., *Tecmed v. Mexico*, *Salini v. Morocco*).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Real economic activities" requirement in the definition of "investor".** This is subject to interpretation and could exclude investments by holding companies.
*   **"As far as possible" obligation to promote investments.** This is a weak obligation and may be difficult to enforce.
*   **The meaning of "fair and equitable treatment" (FET) is evolving and can give rise to disputes.**
*   **"Public interest" exception to the prohibition of expropriation.**
*   **"Effective and Adequate" for Compensation of Expropriation: Subject to different interpretations as to the standard of compensation.**

**Conclusion:** This treaty offers protection for investments between the RP and Mongolia. However, ambiguities exist, particularly in the definitions and the FET standard, which could lead to disputes. A thorough due diligence is necessary before making investments to assess applicable laws and regulatory environment.
