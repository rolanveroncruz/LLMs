**Summary of the 1949 Agreement Between the Republic of the Philippines and CARE**

**Nature:** This is a bilateral agreement between the Republic of the Philippines (represented by the Philippine Relief and Trade Rehabilitation Administration - PRATRA) and the Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe, Inc. (CARE). The agreement aimed to facilitate the delivery of voluntary gifts (primarily food) from donors outside the Philippines to beneficiaries within the Philippines.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Purpose (Clause 1):** Facilitate voluntary gifts of commodities (primarily food) from outside the Philippines to individuals and organizations within the Philippines. Expansion to non-food items requires mutual consent.
*   **CARE's Obligations (Clause 2):**
    *   Issue gift remittances against payments from donors.
    *   Forward remittances for delivery to beneficiaries.
    *   Procure commodities (principally from the US) and send them to the Philippines.
    *   Allocate a share of remaining funds after costs to the Philippines for relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or charitable purposes based on remittance deliveries proportion.
    *   Pay PRATRA a service fee, subject to revisions by mutual agreement.
    *   Specify recipients of gift packages where remittances are drawn in blank or in favor of general relief.
*   **Government (Philippines) Obligations (Clause 4):**
    *   Duty-free import of CARE's gift commodities, supplies, and equipment.
    *   Exemption from duties, tolls, or taxes on gift commodities and, where consistent with Philippine law and treaties, on CARE's assets, income, and non-resident personnel salaries.
    *   Commodities treated as supplementary to ration regulations.
    *   Prohibition of requisitioning or diversion of gift commodities.
    *   Priority treatment for unloading, warehousing, and transport of CARE supplies.
    *   Protection against theft of gift commodities.
    *   Authorization for CARE to label gift commodities.
    *   Favorable exchange rate for CARE's currency conversions.
    *   Exemption from export restrictions for unsold gift commodities.
    *   Public endorsement of the agreement's purpose.
    *   Visa/entry authorization for American CARE representatives.
*   **PRATRA's Responsibilities (Clause 5):**
    *   Receive, inspect, store, and safeguard commodities.
    *   Prepare necessary documentation for import, unloading, and distribution.
    *   Deliver commodities to beneficiaries.
    *   Secure and transmit signed receipts.
    *   Report loss or damage and support CARE's insurance claims.
    *   Maintain required records and accounting forms.
    *   Allow CARE representatives to examine records and operations.
    *   Provide office facilities to CARE representatives.
*   **Termination (Clause 6):** Either party could terminate with 60 days' written notice.  Upon termination, PRATRA was obligated to transfer remaining commodities, supplies, and beneficiary lists to CARE, with CARE bearing the transfer expenses, and to furnish a statement of deliveries and receipts.

**Potential Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Breach of Contract:** Failure by either party to fulfill its obligations (e.g., the Philippines imposing duties, CARE failing to deliver commodities).
*   **Liability for Loss/Damage:** Issues regarding responsibility for loss or damage to commodities during warehousing, transport, and delivery (PRATRA has initial responsibility to safeguard).
*   **Taxation Issues:** While the Philippines agreed to certain tax exemptions, ambiguity exists regarding the scope of those exemptions and how they interact with existing Philippine legislation and treaties.
*   **Operational Issues:** Delays in customs clearance, transportation bottlenecks, or bureaucratic hurdles could hinder CARE's operations.
*   **Diversion of Funds:**  Potential for misuse or misappropriation of funds by CARE after the service period.
*   **Interpretation of "Charitable Purposes"** Clause 2(d) grants CARE discretion in allocating remaining funds to the Philippines. The interpretation of "relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction or other charitable purposes" could become contentious, leading to disputes over the allocation of funds.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Clause 2(d):** The provision regarding CARE's allocation of remaining funds to the Philippines leaves significant discretion to CARE. The term "proportion of the balance from its remittance deliveries which have accrued from deliveries in the Philippines" is open to interpretation and could be a source of dispute.
*   **Clause 4(b)(2):** The tax exemption provision is qualified by the phrase "to the extent that it is not in conflict with Philippine legislation, and in conformity with treaties and agreements between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines." This creates uncertainty and could lead to disputes regarding the applicability of the exemption.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Treaty Interpretation:**  The agreement references treaties between the Philippines and the US. General principles of treaty interpretation, as established in international law and Philippine jurisprudence, would be relevant in resolving disputes related to the tax exemption provision.
*   **Contract Law (Philippine Civil Code):** As a contract, the agreement is subject to the provisions of the Philippine Civil Code regarding obligations, breach of contract, and remedies. Specific provisions regarding the interpretation of contracts (Articles 1370-1379 of the Civil Code) would be relevant.
*   **Sovereign Immunity:** Any potential claims against the Philippine government may raise issues of sovereign immunity.
