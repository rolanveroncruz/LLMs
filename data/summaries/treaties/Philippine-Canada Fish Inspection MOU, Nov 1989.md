## Summary of Philippines-Canada Fish Inspection MOU (1989)

This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Philippines' Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD) and Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), specifically the Inspection Services Directorate (ISD), aims to streamline the inspection of Philippine canned and frozen fish products imported into Canada. The MOU focuses on establishing a "Preferred Status" for Philippine processors who adhere to Canadian Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and maintain a DFO-approved quality control program, resulting in reduced Canadian inspections.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **"Preferred Status":** Defined as processors meeting strict GMP and quality control standards. (III.A.3, III.A.4)
*   **BFAD's Role:** Responsible for monitoring compliance with the MOU requirements in the Philippines. (III.A.1)
*   **DFO/ISD's Role:** Responsible for inspecting imported fish products in Canada and approving/monitoring "Preferred Status" processors. (III.A.2)
*   **Approval Procedure:** Requires joint DFO/BFAD evaluation of applicants to verify compliance with Canadian regulations, quality control programs, and GMP records. (III.B.2)
*   **Compliance Monitoring:** "Preferred Status" processors are subject to periodic monitoring by BFAD and potential joint DFO/BFAD audits. (III.B.3)
*   **Reduced Inspection:** Imports from "Preferred Status" producers are eligible for reduced inspection and monitoring by DFO. (III.A.5, III.B.4)
*   **Suspension/Removal:** Rejection of a monitoring sample by DFO can lead to suspension or removal from "Preferred Status". (III.B.4)
*   **Re-application:** Processors removed from "Preferred Status" can re-apply and may be subject to a joint DFO/BFAD inspection at their expense. (III.B.5, III.B.6, III.B.7)
*   **Information Sharing:** DFO to provide BFAD with inspection results and notification of detentions. (III.B.8, III.B.9, III.B.10, III.B.11)
*   **Plant Rating System:** Minimum "B" rating required based on Schedules I and II of the Canadian Fish Inspection Regulations. (III.A.3, III.B.2, III.C.1). Defined as "B Plant Rating as determined by the plant rating system to determine compliance with Schedules I and II of the Canadian Fish Inspection Regulations"
*   **Annexes:** Annexes detail specific GMPs, container integrity, labelling, chemical and sensory standards, and sampling plans, and the plant rating system
*   **Administrative Procedures:** Can be amended by mutual agreement. (VI)

**Obligations:**

*   **Philippine Processors:** Adherence to Canadian GMPs, maintaining a DFO-approved quality control program, and a minimum plant rating. (III.A.3)
*   **BFAD:** Monitoring Philippine processors and notifying DFO of non-compliance. (III.B.3)
*   **DFO/ISD:** Inspecting imported fish, providing feedback to BFAD, and maintaining information on relevant regulations. (III.B.8-III.B.11)
*   **Association:** Ensuring repayment of DFO expenses relating to section 6 (III.B.7)

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Rejection/Suspension:** Failure to meet Canadian standards can result in rejection of shipments and suspension from "Preferred Status", leading to increased inspection and potential loss of market access. (III.B.4)
*   **Financial Burden:** Processors bear the cost of re-application inspections. (III.B.6, III.B.7)
*   **Enforcement:** MOU relies on the good faith of both parties for enforcement, and potential disputes regarding interpretation of GMPs or compliance can arise. The criteria for "Good Manufacturing Practice" is not defined in the document, other than referring to the Annexes.
*   **Changes to Canadian Law:** DFO reserves the right to unilaterally change criteria within the annexes, potentially impacting Philippine producers. This creates a power imbalance. (VII)
*   **No Private Right of Action:** This MOU is between governmental agencies; private parties (processors, importers) likely have no direct right of action to enforce its provisions.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Fish Inspection Act and Fish Inspection Regulations (Canada):** Referenced throughout the document, particularly regarding plant ratings (Schedules I and II). DFO is obligated to provide these to BFAD (III.B.10)
*   **Canadian Food and Drug Act and Regulations:** While not explicitly stated, these underpin the GMP requirements and quality control standards referenced in the MOU.
*   **Philippines Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act:** Implicitly relevant as BFAD's authority derives from this, although it isn't directly mentioned.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Good Manufacturing Practices":** While generally understood, the lack of a clear definition within the MOU itself leaves room for interpretation and potential disputes, and relies on Annexes which are dynamic
*   **DFO's Right to Change Annexes:** DFO's right to unilaterally alter Annexes could impose new burdens on Philippine processors without reciprocal input, raising fairness concerns. (VII)
*   **Criteria for Removal from "Preferred Status":** The phrase "unacceptable record of performance, as outlined in the administrative procedures" is vague and could lead to arbitrary application. (III.B.4)
*   **Interpretation of "Minimum B Rating":** No definition is provided about what constitutes "compliance with Schedules I and II of the Canadian Fish Inspection Regulations".

**Overall Assessment:**

This MOU provided a framework for facilitating trade in fish products. However, potential issues arise from ambiguities in key definitions, the unilateral power of DFO to modify annexes, and the lack of a dispute resolution mechanism. A modern iteration of this MOU would benefit from clearer definitions, reciprocal amendment rights, and a more robust dispute resolution process. The date of this agreement is 1989, which is likely outdated.
