I can help you summarize Article 9, which discusses the rights of subrogation for payments made to nationals or companies in case of a guarantee given for an investment. Here's a summary:

**Article 9: Rights of Subrogation**

If one Contracting Party makes payments to its own nationals or companies as a result of a guarantee given for an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party, the first mentioned Party has full rights of subrogation regarding the rights and actions of the said national or company.

This means that the paying Party can pursue the beneficiary of the guarantee (i.e., the national or company receiving the payment) for any amount owed to them, rather than pursuing the original guarantor. However, this does not affect the beneficiary's right to resort to international arbitration through the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).

In summary, Article 9 provides a mechanism for the paying Party to seek recourse against the beneficiary of the guarantee in case of non-payment by the guarantor.
