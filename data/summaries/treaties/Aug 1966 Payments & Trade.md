This is a lengthy document outlining the procedures for trade between the Philippines and Indonesia, specifically focusing on letters of credit and clearing accounts. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

**Letter of Credit**

1. The process begins with the establishment of a letter of credit by cable or airmail to an authorized agent bank in Indonesia.
2. The authorized agent bank in Indonesia advises the beneficiary (the importing company) of the letter of credit and forwards a copy to the Central Bank of the Philippines for record purposes.
3. The beneficiary presents the draft and necessary documents to the authorized agent bank in the Philippines, who then forwards them directly to the opening foreign exchange bank in Indonesia (Central Bank of Indonesia).
4. The authorized agent bank in the Philippines receives reimbursement from the Central Bank of the Philippines based on a predetermined formula.

**Clearing Accounts**

1. All trade transactions between the two countries are entered into clearing accounts maintained by both central banks.
2. The value of imports is debited against the account of the Philippines, while the value of exports is credited to the account of Indonesia.
3. Daily updates are exchanged between the two central banks on debit and credit entries in their respective accounts.

**Reconciliation**

1. To effect payments between the two countries, debits and credits are offset against each other in the accounts maintained by both central banks.
2. The reconciled balance is determined using a formula that takes into account the debit and credit balances in both accounts.

This document appears to be a supplement to an earlier agreement between the Philippines and Indonesia, aimed at facilitating trade and managing foreign exchange transactions between the two countries.
