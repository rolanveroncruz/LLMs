This is a section of the Bretton Woods Agreement, specifically Article XXXI and Schedule I, which deals with the liquidation of the Special Drawing Account. Here's a breakdown of what it says:

**Liquidation of the Special Drawing Account**

* The Fund will make payments to participants in 10 half-yearly installments (or a longer period decided by the Fund) using special drawing rights held in the General Account.
* The first payment is due six months after the decision to liquidate the account.

**Distribution of Special Drawing Rights**

* If the Fund decides to liquidate within six months, the Special Drawing Account will not be liquidated until all drawing rights held in the General Account have been distributed among members in proportion to their amounts due.
* After this distribution, the Fund will apportion any remaining special drawing rights among members in proportion to their net cumulative allocations.

**Redemption of Special Drawing Rights**

* The Fund will redeem special drawing rights from governments that terminated participation more than six months before liquidation in accordance with Article XXX or Schedule H terms.
* Participants who are not participating countries will be redeemed before participants, and in proportion to the amount held by each holder.
* The Fund will determine redemption proportions based on net cumulative allocations.

**Interest and Charges**

* The Fund will pay interest on special drawing rights held by holders.
* Participants will pay charges on their cumulative allocation of special drawing rights (less any payments made).

**Default and Currency Distribution**

* If a participant is in default, no amounts will be paid to it until the default is settled.
* Defaulting participants will pay gold or another currency specified by the Fund to settle their obligations.

**Redistribution of Holdings**

* After final payments are made to participants, those with lower holdings will purchase from those with higher holdings to equalize proportions (if necessary).

**Closure of the Special Drawing Account**

* The Fund will close the books and cancel special drawing rights held by participants in default.
* Liabilities arising from special drawing account allocations and administration will cease.

Overall, this section outlines a plan for the liquidation of the Special Drawing Account, including distribution of special drawing rights, redemption of rights, interest payments, charges, and currency distribution.
