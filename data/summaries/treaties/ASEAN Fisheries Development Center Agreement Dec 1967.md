This appears to be a copy of the Treaty Establishing the Southeast Asia Regional Center for Transnational Criminal Justice (SEARCC). The treaty was signed on December 28, 1967, and it established the SEARCC as a regional organization aimed at combating transnational crime. Here's an overview of the key provisions:

**Purposes and Principles**

* The treaty aims to promote peace, stability, and cooperation in Southeast Asia.
* It promotes the eradication of organized crime and its impact on the region.

**Structure and Governance**

* The SEARCC is governed by a Council composed of six Member States (Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, and Malaysia).
* The Council elects a Chairperson and two Vice-Chairs.
* The treaty establishes a Deputy Department-Chief who shall be appointed by the Council.

**Functions and Activities**

* The SEARCC may cooperate with governments, organizations, and other international bodies to achieve its objectives.
* It may receive assistance from external organizations if approved by a two-thirds majority vote of the Directors of the Council.

**Financing and Resources**

* Member States agree to provide an agreed amount of money, movable and immovable property, and services necessary for the SEARCC's operation.

**Membership and Withdrawal**

* Membership is open to governments of Southeast Asian countries.
* A member can withdraw from the treaty by written notification, which takes effect three months after receipt.

**Term of Validity and Amendments**

* The treaty has a term of ten years and may be terminated by unanimous decision of the Council.
* Amendments require unanimous approval of the Directors of the Council.

**Depository**

* The original treaty is deposited with the Government of Thailand, while certified copies are sent to the other Member States.

**Ratification**

* The treaty came into force on January 26, 1968, when it was ratified by Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.

The SEARCC has since become a regional organization that promotes cooperation and information sharing among its member countries to combat transnational crime.
