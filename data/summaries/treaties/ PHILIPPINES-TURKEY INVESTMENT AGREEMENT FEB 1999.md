This is a treaty between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of Turkey regarding investment disputes. Here are some key points:

**Purpose**: The agreement aims to establish a framework for resolving investment disputes between the two countries in a timely, equitable, and cost-effective manner.

**Dispute Resolution Mechanism**: If direct negotiations fail, disputes can be submitted to an arbitral tribunal. The tribunal consists of three arbitrators, with one serving as Chairman, who is a national of a third country with diplomatic relations with both parties.

**Arbitration Process**:

* Each party appoints an arbitrator within two months.
* The two arbitrators select a third arbitrator as Chairman.
* If the Chairman is not appointed within two months, the President of the International Court of Justice makes the appointment.
* The tribunal has three months to agree on rules of procedure; if they fail to do so, the President of the International Court of Justice designates rules.

**Decision-Making**: The tribunal reaches its decisions by a majority vote and determines its own procedure. Decisions are final and binding.

**Expenses**: Expenses incurred during the arbitration process are shared equally between the two parties, unless otherwise agreed upon by the tribunal.

**Prevention of Duplicate Proceedings**: A dispute cannot be submitted to international arbitration if it is already pending before another international arbitration court under Article VIII.

**Entry into Force**: The agreement enters into force on the date of exchange of instruments of ratification and remains in force for ten years, unless terminated earlier or amended.

**Amendments**: The agreement can be amended by written agreement between the parties, which must be notified to each other before entering into force.
