This appears to be a sample of the Manila Agreement on Air Transport between the Government of the Philippines and the Government of the Netherlands, signed on May 8, 1969. The agreement outlines the terms and conditions for air transport services between the two countries.

The agreement covers various aspects of air transport, including:

1. Arbitration: The agreement provides for arbitration in case of disputes between the two countries.
2. Modification of routes: The agreement allows for modifications to routes by direct agreement between the competent aeronautical authorities of the two countries.
3. Registration: The agreement requires that the treaty be registered with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
4. Termination: The agreement provides for termination of the treaty after 12 months from notice, unless withdrawn by mutual agreement.

The agreement is accompanied by a diplomatic note exchanging notes between the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila and the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Manila, confirming that the constitutional formalities have been complied with and that the treaty comes into force on March 19, 1970.

The agreement is also accompanied by two appendices: Annex A, which outlines the procedure for arbitration, and Annex B, which provides additional information about air transport services between the two countries.
