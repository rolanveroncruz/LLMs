**Summary of Trade Agreement between the Philippines and Argentina (1984)**

This is a trade agreement between the Philippines and Argentina, signed on June 29, 1984, designed to promote trade and economic relations. Key provisions, obligations, liabilities, and potential risks are summarized below:

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1:** General promotion of trade and economic relations within domestic laws and regulations.
*   **Article 2:** Grants Most-Favored Nation (MFN) treatment on customs duties, clearance formalities, internal taxes, import/export licenses, foreign exchange transfers, and merchandise distribution. This is a standard trade agreement clause.
*   **Article 3:** Grants MFN treatment to cargo vessels regarding port access and facilities. Excludes activities legally reserved for domestic entities (fishing, coastal trade, inland shipping).
*   **Article 4:** Exceptions to MFN: Includes regional arrangements (customs unions, free trade areas), frontier traffic preferences, and preferences granted to developing countries under trade expansion schemes where the other party isn't a member.
*   **Article 5:** Cooperation in maritime transport of goods and potential agreements for developing shipping between the countries.
*   **Article 6:** Commitment to promoting and increasing trade relations, with an emphasis on increasing the proportion of semi-manufactured and manufactured goods exchanged.
*   **Article 7:** Promotion of commercial exchanges, including representatives, delegations, technology, and participation in exhibits. Customs duties and charges on articles and samples intended for fairs and exhibitions are subject to the laws, rules and regulations of the country where such fairs and exhibitions are held.
*   **Article 8:** Payments to be made in freely convertible currency, subject to currency regulations of each country.
*   **Article 9:** Allows for measures necessary to protect public health, morals, order, security, plants, animals, and natural/artistic/historical heritage.
*   **Article 10:** Consultation mechanism for matters of mutual interest and expansion of cooperation.
*   **Article 11:** Allows for review of the agreement at any time.
*   **Article 12:** Applies to contracts concluded during the agreement's validity even after termination.
*   **Article 13:** Enters into force upon exchange of ratification instruments, remains in force for one year, and continues unless terminated with three months' written notice.
*   **Article 14:** Allows for amendments to the agreement in writing.

**Obligations:**

*   Both parties obligated to grant MFN status (with exceptions).
*   Commitment to promote trade and economic relations.
*   Obligation to consult on matters of mutual interest.
*   Obligation to reply within 120 days upon receipt of notice of amendments.

**Liabilities:**

*   The agreement does not explicitly define liabilities for non-compliance. Enforcement would likely rely on diplomatic channels and potential termination of the agreement.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity in "promoting" trade:** The agreement uses broad language like "promote development" and "make major efforts," which lacks specific metrics or enforcement mechanisms. This can lead to disputes over the level of effort required.
*   **MFN Exceptions:** The broad exceptions to MFN treatment in Article 4, particularly regarding regional arrangements and preferences for developing countries, could significantly limit the agreement's practical effect.
*   **Currency Fluctuations:** Reliance on freely convertible currency exposes transactions to exchange rate risk.
*   **Lack of Dispute Resolution Mechanism:** The agreement lacks a defined dispute resolution mechanism. Disputes would likely need to be resolved through negotiation or diplomatic means, potentially leading to delays and uncertainty.
*   **Termination Clause:** The relatively short one-year initial term and easy termination clause (three-month notice) could lead to instability in trade relations.

**Relevant Legal Considerations:**

*   **Public International Law:** This agreement is governed by principles of public international law, including the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), which addresses interpretation and termination of treaties. The VCLT dictates how the English text shall prevail, considering there might be differences in the Pilipino and Spanish text.
*   **WTO Law:** Although the agreement predates the WTO, its provisions, particularly regarding MFN treatment, are relevant to WTO principles. The exceptions to MFN must be consistent with WTO rules, especially Article XXIV GATT concerning customs unions and free trade areas.
*   **Philippine Law:** Implementation of the agreement requires compliance with relevant Philippine laws and regulations, including customs laws, trade regulations, and foreign exchange controls.
*   **Argentine Law:** Implementation of the agreement requires compliance with relevant Argentine laws and regulations, including customs laws, trade regulations, and foreign exchange controls.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Article 1:** The phrase "within the framework of rules, laws and regulations effective in their respective countries" essentially gives each party the ability to nullify any commitment made if it conflicts with existing domestic law.
*   **Article 6:** The term "increasing proportion" regarding semi-manufactured and manufactured goods is vague and lacks a clear definition, making it difficult to enforce.
*   **Article 9:** The exceptions for measures protecting public health, morals, etc., are broadly worded and could be used to justify protectionist measures that violate the spirit of the agreement, depending on the specific implementation by either party.
