This is a draft of the Investment Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the Kingdom of Denmark. The agreement establishes the rules for investment disputes between the two countries.

Here's a breakdown of the key provisions:

**ARTICLE X: DISPUTES BETWEEN THE CONTRACTING PARTIES**

* If a dispute arises, the parties will try to settle it through negotiations.
* If negotiations fail, the dispute can be submitted to an arbitral tribunal.

**ARTICLE XI: CONSULTATIONS**

* The parties agree to consult each other on any matter affecting the implementation of the agreement.

**ARTICLE XII: APPLICABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT**

* The agreement applies to investments made by investors of one party in the territory of the other party prior to or after the entry into force of the agreement.
* However, it does not apply to disputes that have arisen before its entry into force.

**ARTICLE XIII: AMENDMENTS**

* The provisions of the agreement may be amended at any time through mutual agreement between the parties.
* Amendments must be notified in writing and become effective upon completion of national legal requirements.

**ARTICLE XIV: TERRITORIAL EXTENSION**

* This agreement does not apply to the Faroe Islands and Greenland, which can be extended as mutually agreed upon in an Exchange of Notes.

**ARTICLE XV: ENTRY INTO FORCE**

* The agreement enters into force 30 days after the date of the last notification from the parties.

**ARTICLE XVI: DURATION AND TERMINATION**

* The agreement remains in force for 15 years.
* After termination, provisions related to investments made prior to termination remain in force for an additional 15 years.

The agreement also includes a provision that, in case of divergence between the two languages used (English and Danish), the English text shall prevail.

This is just one example of an investment agreement. The specifics can vary widely depending on the countries involved, their economic interests, and other factors.
