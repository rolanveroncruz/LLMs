**AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION CONCERNING ASSISTANCE FOR A SEMINAR ON HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION**

**Summary for a Lawyer:**

### Key Provisions:

*   The Philippines agrees to provide assistance for a national seminar on hospital administration, which will be organized and conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO).
*   WHO will provide two consultants, supplies, and equipment worth up to US$500.
*   The Basic Agreement between the Philippines and WHO (concluded on 28 December 1960) governs the implementation of this request.

### Obligations:

1.  **Government Obligations:**
    *   Insure WHO, its advisers, agents, and employees for civil liability under the laws of the country.
    *   Prepare and issue the seminar report.
    *   Provide government counterparts to work with and assist the consultants during their assignments.
2.  **WHO Obligations:**
    *   Provide two consultants (one in medical care and one in a specialty decided after consultation with the national Steering Committee).
    *   Supply equipment worth up to US$500.

### Liabilities:

1.  **Government Liability:**
    *   The government assumes liability for any civil claims arising from the seminar, as per the applicable laws of the country.
2.  **WHO Liability:**
    *   WHO's liability is not explicitly stated in the agreement.

### Potential Risks:

*   **Ambiguous Clause:** The agreement does not specify what constitutes "civil liability" under the laws of the Philippines. This may lead to ambiguity and potential disputes.
*   **Limited Financial Assistance:** The maximum financial assistance provided by WHO (US$500) might be insufficient for a comprehensive seminar, potentially leading to financial constraints.

### Relevant Case Law:

There are no specific case law references available in this document. However, relevant Philippine laws, such as the Civil Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 506), may provide guidance on liability and obligations.

### Statutory References:

*   Republic Act No. 506 (Civil Code of the Philippines)
*   Basic Agreement between the Philippines and WHO (concluded on 28 December 1960)

### Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:

The clause stating that the government assumes liability for any civil claims arising from the seminar, as per the applicable laws of the country, is ambiguous. This may lead to disputes regarding what constitutes "civil liability" under Philippine law.

**Conclusion:**

This agreement between the Philippines and WHO provides a framework for assistance in organizing a national seminar on hospital administration. The government has specific obligations, including providing insurance coverage and preparing the seminar report. While WHO's obligations are clearly stated, the agreement lacks explicit details on liability. A thorough review of relevant Philippine laws and case law is recommended to ensure compliance with applicable regulations.
