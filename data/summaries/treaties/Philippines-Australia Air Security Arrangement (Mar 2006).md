## Summary of Philippines-Australia Arrangement on Deployment of Air Security Officers (2006)

**Nature:** This Arrangement (dated March 21, 2006) outlines the understandings between the Philippines and Australia regarding the deployment of Air Security Officers (ASOs) on regular scheduled commercial passenger flights between the two countries. It aims to enhance aviation security in the face of transnational terrorist threats.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Purpose (Para. 1):** To enhance security of scheduled commercial flights.
*   **Definitions (Para. 1):** Defines key terms like "Air Security Officer," "Sending State," "Receiving State," "Operational Equipment," and "Weapons" (including lethal and non-lethal).
*   **Scope (Para. 2):** Applies to regular scheduled commercial flights between the two countries and to flights diverted from a third country.
*   **Sending State Obligations (Para. 3):** Character checks, visa requirements, declaration of weapons/equipment, notification to Receiving State of ASO identity and equipment, notification of incidents, and handover of alleged offenders (subject to Para 4.2).
*   **Receiving State Obligations (Para. 4):** Facilitate admission/departure of ASOs and their equipment, take custody of individuals detained by ASOs.  Crucially, it mandates *due consideration* to Sending State representations, including extradition requests. Para 4.2(c) requires due consideration of the Australian Government's view where an offender arrested by an ASO faces the death penalty in the Philippines.
*   **Operational Arrangements (Para. 5):** Supplemented by further written operational procedures agreed upon separately.
*   **Jurisdiction (Paras. 6 & 7):** The Sending State's laws govern ASO conduct *onboard* the aircraft until disembarkation. The Receiving State's laws apply *after* disembarkation. This is a crucial jurisdictional carve-out.
*   **Confidentiality (Para. 8):** Requires confidentiality regarding documents, information, and data exchanged.
*   **Dispute Resolution (Para. 9):** Requires good faith negotiation through diplomatic channels.
*   **Amendment/Termination (Paras. 11 & 12):** Amendment requires mutual written consent. Termination requires one month's written notice.

**Obligations:**

*   Both States have obligations regarding information sharing, facilitating movement of personnel and equipment, and handling individuals detained by ASOs. The Receiving State has an obligation to *consider* (but not necessarily grant) extradition requests or representations regarding sentencing.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Arrangement does not explicitly address liability for actions taken by ASOs. However, jurisdictional provisions (Paras. 6 & 7) likely govern potential legal claims arising from ASO conduct. Any tortious acts committed by an ASO in the Sending state, between "the point the doors of the aircraft are closed for takeoff and until any external aircraft doors are opened for disembarkation" would be subject to the Sending State's (Australian) jurisdiction. After this point, Philippines National Laws apply.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Vagueness of "Due Consideration":** The term "due consideration" in Para. 4.2 (a) and (c) is vague. It provides no clear standard for how the Receiving State should weigh the Sending State's representations. This could lead to disputes.
*   **Lack of Liability Provisions:** The absence of explicit provisions regarding liability for ASO actions or inactions could create uncertainty. What happens if an ASO uses excessive force? Which jurisdiction's laws apply, and who is ultimately responsible?
*   **Interaction with Local Laws:** The Arrangement requires compliance with the Receiving State's customs and other laws (Para. 3(c)). However, potential conflicts could arise between operational procedures and local laws. The operational procedures (Para 5) need to be scrutinized to ensure compliance with both states' national laws.
*   **Definition of "Incident" (Para 3(e))**: Could trigger obligations even for minor incidents, creating an administrative burden.
*   **Ambiguity in definition of Operational Equipment:** "such as restraining devices, armor vests, wire cutters, pliers, gas masks, and the like. These may also include electronic or computer gadgets." This is a non-exhaustive list and "the like" and "may also include" creates uncertainty as to the parameters of what constitutes operational equipment.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   The Arrangement references the **Tokyo Convention, Montreal Convention, and Hague Convention** relating to air safety, which provide a framework for international cooperation on aviation security. These treaties might be relevant in interpreting the Arrangement's provisions.
*   **Extradition treaties** between the Philippines and Australia would be relevant in the context of Para. 4.2, especially regarding the extradition of offenders.
*   **Philippine and Australian criminal laws** would govern the prosecution of offenses committed by or against ASOs within their respective jurisdictions.
*   **International law principles of jurisdiction** (territorial, nationality, protective) may also be relevant in interpreting jurisdictional provisions of the Arrangement.

**Conclusion:**

This Arrangement creates a framework for cooperation, but its ambiguities, particularly concerning the obligations relating to due consideration, jurisdiction over ASOs, and the lack of explicit liability provisions, could lead to disputes. Careful consideration must be given to the operational procedures developed under Para. 5 to ensure that they are consistent with the laws of both states and that they adequately address potential liability issues. Furthermore, in the event of an incident involving an ASO, careful consideration should be given to which state's jurisdiction applies, and whether the offense occurred between "the point the doors of the aircraft are closed for takeoff and until any external aircraft doors are opened for disembarkation" or after this point.
