This is a copy of the Philippines-Australia Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement, also known as the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), signed on January 25, 1995. The agreement aims to promote and protect investments between the Philippines and Australia.

The treaty consists of nine articles that address various aspects of investment promotion and protection, including:

1. Arbitration proceedings: Provides for a process for resolving disputes through arbitration.
2. Settlement of disputes: Requires each party to provide investors from the other party with access to its judicial or administrative bodies.
3. Entry into force, duration, and termination: Outlines the terms under which the agreement can be terminated.

The treaty also includes a protocol that provides additional clarification on certain provisions, including the payment of compensation in case of expropriation.

It's worth noting that this is an older agreement, and more recent investment treaties may have been negotiated between the Philippines and Australia. If you're looking for more up-to-date information, I can try to help you find it.
