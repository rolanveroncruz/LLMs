This document appears to be a research project proposal, specifically an International Research Co-operation Agreement between the University of Queensland (UQ) in Australia and the University of the Philippines (U.P.) in the Philippines. The project aims to develop and optimize an embryogenesis and regeneration system for mango, with a focus on improving fruit shelf-life and disease resistance.

Here are some key points from the document:

**Research Objectives:**

1. To develop and optimize an embryogenesis and regeneration system for mango.
2. To introduce new genes that confer long-shelf-life and postharvest disease resistance to Filipino, Malaysian, and Australian papaya varieties.
3. To improve fruit quality and reduce spoilage.

**Expected Benefits:**

1. Improved fruit availability without increasing yield.
2. Reduced postharvest disease resistance.
3. Increased consumer benefit through longer shelf life.
4. Enhanced competitiveness for UQ and U.P.

**Project Structure and Coordination:**

1. Project divided into distinct subprograms to facilitate coordination.
2. Australian collaborators meet every three months to discuss progress, budget spending, and solve difficulties.
3. Overseas coordinators visit the Philippines and Malaysia twice a year to ensure adequate progress and identify areas of difficulty.
4. Mid-project workshop in Brisbane to review progress on cloning target genes and tissue culture/transformation methods.

**Personnel:**

1. UQ and U.P. will allocate staff, including postdoctoral scientists, technical assistants, and researchers.
2. Personnel will work together to achieve project objectives.

**Duration:**

The exact duration of the project is not specified in the document, but it appears to be a multi-year research initiative.

This proposal outlines a collaborative effort between UQ and U.P. to improve mango production through genetic engineering and tissue culture techniques. The expected benefits are numerous, including improved fruit availability, reduced spoilage, and increased consumer satisfaction.
