The MOU outlines the terms and conditions for the use of these funds, including:

1. Payment of interest and repayment of principal: The Philippine government will be responsible for paying any levies or taxes related to the use of the loans.
2. Prohibition on using mixed credits for fiscal levies: The mixed credits will not be used to pay direct or indirect fiscal levies in the Philippines.
3. Goods and services procurement: The contracts funded by the mixed credit will be procured from UK suppliers, with the goods being shipped and insured according to commercial competitive practice.
4. Eligibility of projects: Only capital goods and related services will be eligible for support under the arrangements set out in this understanding.
5. Repayment of loans: The Philippines will ensure that the appropriate counterpart finance is provided for local costs required to complete approved projects.
6. Termination or suspension of projects: The two governments will consult on measures to resolve problems, including treatment of any grants already paid or to be paid.
7. Use of funds: The Philippine government must use the funds for civilian purposes only and take reasonable precautions to protect them in advance of work being carried out.

The MOU also includes provisions related to the granting of credit facilities, including the re-lending of project funding by the Philippines' financial institutions to private sector end-users.

This MOU was signed on September 1, 1995, and entered into operation on that date.
