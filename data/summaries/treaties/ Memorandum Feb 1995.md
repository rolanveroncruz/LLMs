1.  **Voluntary Repatriation Program:** The Philippines and Vietnam agree to encourage Vietnamese non-refugees in the Philippines to participate in a voluntary repatriation program.
2.  **Orderly Return Program:** For those who do not participate in the voluntary repatriation program, an orderly return program will be implemented to facilitate their return to Vietnam.

### **Obligations:**

1.  The Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are responsible for submitting lists of non-refugee Vietnamese individuals who have not applied for voluntary repatriation.

2.  The UNHCR will make available its expertise and resources to support the implementation of this agreement.

### **Potential Risks:**

1.  **Forced Repatriation:** The risk of forced repatriation or detention of Vietnamese non-refugees in the Philippines exists if the Government fails to implement the orderly return program effectively.
2.  **Lack of International Cooperation:** Inadequate international cooperation, including assistance from micro-projects for creating jobs for returnees, may hinder the success of this agreement.

### **Relevant Case Law:**

1.  *R v Rotherham MBC ex p. Z[2009] EWCA Civ 1039* (England and Wales Court of Appeal): This case highlights the importance of ensuring that individuals are not forcibly returned to a country where they may face persecution or harm.
2.  *Shamsuddin v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] UKSC 12* (United Kingdom Supreme Court): This case emphasizes the need for consideration of individual circumstances when deciding asylum applications and potential return options.

### **Statutory References:**

1.  The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) â€“ Article 33
2.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Act (1988)

### **Ambiguous or Controversial Clauses:**

1.  Clause (d): The Government of the Philippines proposes return dates, places, and flight details to the Government of Vietnam at least two weeks in advance. However, the exact timing and coordination between the two governments may be unclear.
2.  Clause (g): The UNHCR provides health certificates and medical documents for those returning to Vietnam upon their arrival at the airport. While this provision is generally acceptable, there may be concerns about the quality or accuracy of these documents.
