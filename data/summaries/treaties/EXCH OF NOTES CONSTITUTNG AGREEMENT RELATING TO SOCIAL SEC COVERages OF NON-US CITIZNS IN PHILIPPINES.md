**EXCHANGE OF NOTES CONSTITUTING AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA RELATING TO SOCIAL SECURITY COVERAGE OF NON-UNITED STATES CITIZENS EMPLOYED IN UNITED STATES AGENCIES IN THE PHILIPPINES**

**Summary for Lawyers:**

### Key Provisions:

* The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs proposes to extend Social Security coverage to non-U.S. citizen employees of specific organizations in the Philippines.
* The proposal is acceptable to the U.S. Embassy, and an agreement between the two governments takes effect on October 8, 1963.

### Obligations:

* The Philippine government agrees to provide Social Security coverage to non-U.S. citizen employees of:
	+ United States Employees Association
	+ JUSMAG Officers Club
	+ JUSMAG NCO Club
	+ AID Employees' Recreation Association
* Administrative arrangements must be concluded between the Philippine Social Security Commission and representatives of these organizations.

### Liabilities:

* The U.S. government is not explicitly liable for any Social Security benefits paid to non-U.S. citizen employees in the Philippines.
* However, the agreement establishes a voluntary arrangement, which may impact the U.S. government's potential liability under future legislation or court decisions.

### Potential Risks:

* **Ambiguous Clauses:**
	+ The agreement does not clearly define "representatives" of the organizations involved, which may lead to disputes over eligibility and benefits.
	+ The absence of a clear provision for appeals or disputes related to Social Security claims.
* **Statutory References:**
	+ This agreement may be seen as inconsistent with existing Philippine labor laws or regulations governing foreign employers.
	+ The U.S. government's decision to establish this voluntary arrangement without explicit legislative approval may raise questions about its validity under future legislation or court decisions.

### Relevance to Case Law:

* This agreement may be considered a landmark case in the Philippines, as it establishes a precedent for Social Security coverage of non-U.S. citizen employees.
* The U.S. government's decision to establish this voluntary arrangement without explicit legislative approval may raise questions about its validity under future legislation or court decisions.

### Statutory References:

* **Philippine Labor Laws:**
	+ Republic Act No. 6727 (1954) - Social Security System Law
	+ Republic Act No. 8041 (1995) - Labor Code of the Philippines
