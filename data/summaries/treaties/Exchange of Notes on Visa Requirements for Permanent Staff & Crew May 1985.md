**EXCHANGE OF NOTES ON VISA REQUIREMENTS FOR AIR TRANSPORT ENTERPRISES AND CREW MEMBERS**
====================================================================

**Summary for Lawyers**

This 1985 exchange of notes between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of the Philippines addresses visa requirements for permanent staff members of air transport enterprises and crew members operating scheduled flights.

### Key Provisions:

1. **Multiple Entry-Exit Visas**: The embassy of each party shall issue multiple entry-exit visas valid for one year to permanent staff members and their accompanying spouses and minor children upon request.
2. **Crew Member Lists**: The designated air transport enterprise shall submit a list of crew members three weeks prior to the scheduled flight, which must include name, date and place of birth, position, and passport numbers.
3. **Exemption from Visa Fees**: Permanent staff members and their accompanying spouses and minor children are exempt from visa fees, while crew members are also exempt but not from filling out forms or providing photos.
4. **Restrictions on Crew Members**: Crew members shall not include those of other nationalities handled through diplomatic channels.

### Obligations:

* The embassy of each party must ensure an early issue of multiple entry-exit visas.
* The designated air transport enterprise must submit the crew member list in advance.

### Liabilities:

* Neither party is explicitly liable for non-compliance with these provisions.

### Potential Risks:

* Failure to comply with visa requirements may lead to delays or denials, which could impact flight operations and reputation.
* Misrepresentation of crew members' eligibility or nationality on the submitted list may result in denied visas or other complications.

### Relevant Case Law:

* None explicitly cited in this document. However, relevant cases such as _Air Transport Association of America v. United States_ (1987) may provide insight into the implications of non-compliance with visa requirements.

### Statutory References:

* [Visa Requirements for Foreign Nationals](https://www.philippines.gov.ph/foreign-affairs/immigration/reports-and-data/visa-requirements-for-foreign-nationals) ( Republic Act No. 6737, 1995)

### Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:

* Clause 3 of Note 2 is ambiguous regarding the use of multiple entry-exit visas by crew members for purposes other than operating scheduled flights.
* The phrase "except those whose eligibility is questionable" in Clause 1 of Note 2 may be subject to interpretation.

**Recommendation**

Lawyers should carefully review these provisions and ensure that all parties comply with the agreed-upon requirements. Additionally, they should consider seeking guidance on potential risks and ambiguities within the document.
