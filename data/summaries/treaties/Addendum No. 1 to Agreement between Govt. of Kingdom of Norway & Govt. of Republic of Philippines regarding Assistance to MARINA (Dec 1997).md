### Case Law and Statutory References

*   No relevant case law or statutory references are provided.
*   The STCW Convention (1978) may be applicable in the context of maritime industry regulation, but its relevance to this specific Addendum is unclear without further information.

### Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses

*   **"in consultation between the Parties"**: This phrase may lead to ambiguity regarding how obligations should be fulfilled, as it does not clearly specify a process for dispute resolution.
*   **Termination grounds**: The original Agreement provides grounds for termination, but this Addendum does not explicitly address any potential consequences or repercussions for early termination.

### Recommendations
