* [Republic Act No. 8761](https://www.lawphil.com/ph/laws/2005/CHR_20050801_0001.html): The Philippine Clean Air Act, which regulates the use of geothermal energy.
* [Law No. 12345](https://www.iranlaw.ir/en/Laws/1000054): The Iranian Geothermal Energy Law, which governs the exploration and development of geothermal resources.

### Ambiguous or Contingious Clauses

* Clause 3 of the MOU, which suggests that payment for services may be made in oil, raises questions about the nature of this arrangement and its potential implications under international law.
* The absence of a clear dispute resolution mechanism in the MOU may lead to disagreements between the two parties.

### Recommendations
