## Summary of 1949 US-Philippines Exchange of Notes Amending Road, Street and Bridge Agreement

**Document:** Exchange of Notes constituting an agreement amending the February 14, 1947, Agreement between the Philippines and the United States regarding a Road, Street and Bridge Programme. Entered into force December 21, 1949. Referenced as 174 UNTS, p. 278.

**Key Provision:** This agreement amends Article XVI of the 1947 Agreement, which stipulated a termination date of June 30, 1950.

**Amendment:** The amendment extends the termination date of the 1947 Agreement to **June 30, 1951**. This extension is based on Public Law 295 of the 81st US Congress, which authorized the extension of the program.

**Obligations:** The primary obligation remains adherence to the terms of the original 1947 Agreement, now extended to June 30, 1951. No new specific obligations are created by this amendment beyond continuing the pre-existing road, street, and bridge program.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   The agreement implies continued adherence to the original agreement, therefore any breach of the 1947 agreement, as amended, remains a liability.
*   Potential liabilities associated with the Road, Street, and Bridge Programme itself, specifically relating to construction defects, negligence, or failure to comply with applicable local laws and regulations in the Philippines (even in 1950/51) related to contract administration or project execution.
*   The phrase "without prejudice to any further revisions which may be necessary in the future" indicates an understanding that the terms of the 1947 Agreement could be further amended. Failure to agree on further amendments could become a point of contention.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The agreement explicitly references **Public Law 295 of the 81st United States Congress** as justification for the extension. This Public Law should be reviewed to understand the specific scope and limitations of the extended authorization.
*   The original agreement (Feb 14, 1947) must be considered in conjunction with this amendment.
*   General principles of Treaty Interpretation under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (while not directly applicable to this pre-dating agreement, it provides guiding principles) may be relevant if disputes arise regarding the agreement's interpretation. Relevant principles are those of *pacta sunt servanda* and good faith interpretation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The amending procedure, as mentioned in Article XVI, requires an "exchange of notes" for revisions, implying a mutual agreement. Disagreements on future revisions could potentially lead to disputes regarding the validity of amendments.
*   Lack of clarity on potential changes to the program scope or funding. The document only addresses the termination date, leaving other aspects of the original agreement unchanged, but open to future revision based on Article XVI.

**Recommendations for Further Review:**

*   Review the original 1947 Agreement to fully understand the scope of the Road, Street, and Bridge Programme.
*   Examine Public Law 295 of the 81st United States Congress to determine any specific conditions or limitations attached to the extension.
*   Research contemporary Philippine laws and regulations related to construction projects and government contracts in the 1950s, to assess potential liabilities.
