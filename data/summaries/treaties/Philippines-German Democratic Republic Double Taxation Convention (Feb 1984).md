## Summary of RP-GDR Double Taxation Convention (1984)

This convention aims to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion regarding income taxes between the Philippines and the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Note that the GDR ceased to exist in 1990, raising questions regarding the ongoing applicability of this treaty.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1: Personal Scope:** Applies to residents of one or both contracting states.
*   **Article 2: Taxes Covered:** Income taxes levied by each state, including taxes on gains from property alienation and wage taxes, and includes a list of specific taxes covered.  Crucially, it covers identical or "substantially similar" taxes imposed after the signature date. This is a potential point of contention, as the current German tax system is significantly different.
*   **Article 3: General Definitions:** Defines key terms like "Contracting State," "Person," "National," "Company," "Enterprise," "Competent Authority," and "International Traffic."  Defines profits from operation of ship and aircraft.
*   **Article 4: Resident:** Defines "resident" based on domicile, residence, place of management, or similar criteria.  Contains tie-breaker rules for dual residency based on permanent home, center of vital interests, habitual abode, and nationality.
*   **Article 5: Permanent Establishment (PE):** Defines PE as a fixed place of business. Contains detailed lists of activities that constitute or do not constitute a PE (including construction projects, storage facilities, etc.). Includes provisions regarding dependent agents constituting a PE. *This Article contains thresholds for determining permanent establishment which are relevant to business tax.*
*   **Articles 6-13: Income Allocation:**  Deals with specific income types:
    *   **Article 6:** Immovable property (taxable in the situs state).
    *   **Article 7:** Business profits (taxable where PE exists, attributing profits as if it were a distinct entity). *Allocation of expenses is covered in this article.*
    *   **Article 8:** Shipping (Taxable in state of enterprise with cap.)
    *   **Article 9:** Associated Enterprises (arm's length principle). *Important for transfer pricing considerations. Correlative adjustments are included.*
    *   **Articles 10-12:** Dividends, Interest, and Royalties may be taxed only in the state owned by the enterprise.
    *   **Article 13:** Gains from Alienation of Property (Taxable in situs state of immovable property and shares of companies consisting of immovable property. Otherwise, taxable in enterprise state.)
*   **Articles 14-21: Income from Services:**
    *   **Articles 14:** Independent Personal Services (Taxable in state of fixed base or where stay exceeds 90 days).
    *   **Article 15:** Dependent Personal Services (Taxable where employment is exercised, subject to 183-day rule, payor residency, and PE considerations).
    *   **Article 16:** Directors' Fees (Taxable in company's state of residency).
    *   **Article 17:** Artistes (Taxable where activities are performed, subject to exceptions for publicly funded performances, non-profit organizations, and cultural exchanges).
    *   **Articles 18-21:** Pensions, Government Service, Students/Trainees, and Professors/Teachers (typically taxable only in the state of residency or source, subject to specific conditions).
*   **Article 23: Relief from Double Taxation:**  Philippines uses a tax credit method. The GDR (prior to reunification) also used a tax credit method. This article also addresses tax incentives, requiring a tax credit equivalent to the tax that *would have been* paid without the incentive. *Important for interpreting the actual tax burden.*
*   **Article 24: Non-Discrimination:** Prohibits discriminatory taxation based on nationality or PE presence. Allows for limitations on tax incentives to nationals in the promotion of necessary business or industry.
*   **Article 25: Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP):** Allows taxpayers to present cases to competent authorities for resolution of disputes regarding treaty interpretation. Includes a five-year time limit for increasing the tax base.
*   **Article 26: Exchange of Information:** Allows competent authorities to exchange information necessary for carrying out the treaty and domestic tax laws. Contains limitations to protect trade secrets and public policy.
*   **Article 30: Termination:** Allows either state to terminate the convention with written notice six months before the end of the calendar year, effective for the following tax year.

**Obligations:**

*   Contracting states must avoid double taxation through the agreed-upon methods (primarily tax credits).
*   Contracting states must exchange information necessary for treaty enforcement.
*   Contracting states must not discriminate against nationals or enterprises of the other state.
*   Taxpayers must comply with the provisions of the treaty to benefit from its protections.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential for double taxation if the treaty is misinterpreted or misapplied.
*   Penalties under domestic tax laws for non-compliance or misrepresentation.
*   Potential for adjustments to profits and tax liabilities due to transfer pricing issues (Article 9).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Applicability Post-GDR Unification:**  The continued validity of a treaty with a non-existent state is a significant concern. The prevailing view is that the Federal Republic of Germany succeeded to the GDR's treaty obligations. This requires thorough legal research and analysis, considering German jurisprudence and international law.
*   **"Substantially Similar" Taxes (Article 2):** Interpretation of what constitutes a "substantially similar" tax. The German tax system underwent significant changes after reunification, and it may be argued that the current taxes are not "substantially similar."
*   **Permanent Establishment Thresholds (Article 5):** The 183-day thresholds for construction projects and service provisions need careful monitoring and documentation to avoid inadvertently triggering PE status.
*   **Treaty Shopping:** Potential for abuse by entities attempting to improperly claim treaty benefits. The "beneficial owner" requirement in Articles 10-12 aims to prevent this, but careful due diligence is necessary.
*   **Interpretation Differences:** Disagreements between competent authorities regarding the interpretation of specific articles.
*   **Impact of MLI (Multilateral Instrument):** The RP-Germany tax treaty may be impacted by the MLI, which could modify or supersede certain provisions. The MLI's application to this specific treaty needs to be assessed.
*   **Obsolete Tax Definitions:** Tax definitions, especially those related to the GDR system, may be archaic or ill-defined based on current taxation schemes.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   Relevant Philippine tax laws (e.g., the National Internal Revenue Code) regarding income taxation and tax credits.
*   Relevant German tax laws (e.g., Einkommensteuergesetz, KÃ¶rperschaftsteuergesetz) regarding income and corporate taxation.
*   Philippine and German jurisprudence on treaty interpretation and the application of double taxation agreements.
*   Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (regarding treaty interpretation and succession of states).
*   OECD Model Tax Convention and Commentary (as persuasive authority for interpreting treaty provisions).

**Recommendations:**

*   Thoroughly research the treaty's current status in light of GDR unification, considering German legal precedent and international law principles.
*   Assess the potential impact of the MLI on the treaty.
*   Carefully analyze the specific facts of each case to determine the applicability of the treaty and the proper allocation of income.
*   Consult with tax experts in both the Philippines and Germany to ensure consistent interpretation and application of the treaty.
