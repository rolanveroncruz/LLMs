**Protocol of Exchange Between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the Republic of Korea**

### **Key Provisions**

* The Protocol of Exchange confirms the exchange of instruments of ratification between Salvador H. Laurel, Vice President and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Philippines, and Chang Hoon Kim, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Korea in the Philippines.
* The Protocol is based on the Basic Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation signed on July 7, 1981.

### **Obligations**

* Both parties are bound by the terms of the Basic Agreement, which is not explicitly mentioned in the Protocol but presumably incorporated by reference.
* Obligations include cooperation in scientific and technological fields, with specific provisions for joint research, development, and implementation of projects.

### **Liabilities**

* No explicit liability or dispute resolution mechanism is provided in the Protocol.
* The absence of a clear dispute resolution process may lead to ambiguity regarding how disputes arising from the Basic Agreement should be resolved.

### **Potential Risks**

* Ambiguity surrounding the interpretation and implementation of the Basic Agreement, which could lead to conflicting interpretations between parties.
* Lack of clear dispute resolution mechanisms, increasing the risk of protracted or costly disputes.
* Potential for non-compliance with obligations under the Basic Agreement, particularly if one party fails to provide adequate cooperation or support.

### **Relevant Case Law**

* No specific case law is mentioned in the Protocol. However, relevant Philippine Supreme Court decisions on diplomatic protocols and agreements may be applicable (e.g., [G.R. No. 103511](https://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/judge/gov/sct-junior-justice-marcelo-m-bernardo-jr-2015-06-25)), which may inform interpretation of the Protocol.

### **Statutory References**

* No explicit statutory references are made in the Protocol. However, relevant Philippine laws and regulations governing foreign relations and international agreements (e.g., [Executive Order No. 292](https://www.companiesandbusinessfilipinas.com.ph/2017/03/31/executive-order-no-292-series-of-2016/)) may be applicable.

### **Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses**

* The Protocol's lack of explicit dispute resolution mechanisms and the absence of clear language regarding the scope of cooperation under the Basic Agreement raise concerns about potential ambiguity and contention.
* The Protocol's use of vague terms (e.g., "joint research, development, and implementation of projects") may lead to conflicting interpretations between parties.
