A branch profits remittance tax of up to 10% is allowed.
*   **Article 11 (Interest):** Interest may be taxed in the State of residence of the recipient. Source State taxation is limited to 10%. Exemption from tax in the source state if derived and beneficially owned by the Government of the other Contracting Slate, including any political subdivision or local authority thereof, the Central Bank or any financial institution wholly owned by that Government; or a resident of the other Contracting State in connection with the loan or credit guaranteed by the Government of that other State.

*   **Article 28 (Termination):** Allows termination by either Contracting State with six months' notice.

**Protocol:**

*   **Special Tax Treatment:** The Convention does not apply to income derived by companies or other persons enjoying special tax treatment if rates applicable do not exceed the limitations provided for in the Convention.
*   **Treaty Shopping:** Benefits are denied to companies established solely to obtain treaty benefits.
*   **Anti-Avoidance:** Does not prevent application of domestic anti-avoidance rules (thin capitalization, transfer pricing, substance over form).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Both States are obligated to provide relief from double taxation according to Article 22.
*   Both States are obligated to exchange information to enforce the Convention and their domestic tax laws (Article 25).
*   Enterprises are liable to comply with transfer pricing rules (Article 9) and must avoid treaty shopping (Protocol).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "Place of Effective Management":** Determining the POEM under Article 8 can be contentious and subject to litigation (see *OECD Model Tax Convention* commentaries).
*   **"Substance over Form" Doctrine (Protocol):** The phrase "substance over form" is open to interpretation by domestic courts, creating uncertainty.
*   **Treaty Shopping (Protocol):** Determining if the purpose of establishing a company was *solely* to obtain treaty benefits is subjective and fact-dependent.
*   **PE Definition (Article 5):** Applying the PE definition, particularly in the context of service PEs and dependent agents, often leads to disputes and is heavily fact-specific.
*   **Beneficial Ownership:** Articles 10, 11, and 12 rely on the concept of "beneficial ownership," which can be ambiguous.
*   **Article 21 (Other Income):** Income not dealt with in the foregoing Articles and arising in a Contracting State may be taxed in that State. Could lead to uncertainty.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Domestic tax laws of the Philippines and the Czech Republic (for definitions and application of concepts not defined in the Convention â€“ Article 3(2)).
*   OECD Model Tax Convention and its Commentaries (as guidance for interpreting treaty provisions).
*   Philippine National Internal Revenue Code.
*   Czech Republic Income Tax Act.
*   Case law from both Philippines and Czech Republic regarding interpretation of double taxation treaties and concepts like PE, beneficial ownership, and transfer pricing.

**Key Advice:**

Careful consideration of the domestic tax laws of both the Philippines and the Czech Republic is crucial when applying this treaty. The "substance over form" doctrine, treaty shopping clause, and PE definition are significant areas of potential dispute.
