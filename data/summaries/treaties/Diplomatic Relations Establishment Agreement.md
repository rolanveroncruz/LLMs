**Exchange of Notes between the Republic of the Philippines and the Hungarian People's Republic for the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations**

### Key Provisions:

* The exchange of notes constitutes a formal agreement establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries.
* Both governments agree to develop and strengthen friendly and mutually beneficial relations, guided by principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs.

### Obligations:

* Each government is obligated to:
	+ Establish diplomatic missions (embassies) at each other's capital cities.
	+ Exchange mutually accredited ambassadors.
	+ Make simultaneous announcements of the agreement on September 29, 1973, in both Manila and Budapest.

### Liabilities:

* **Liability for Non-Compliance:** No specific provisions address the consequences of non-compliance with the agreement. However, Article II of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) requires that a diplomatic mission be established within six months of the exchange of notes.
* **Ambassadorial Appointments:** The government responsible for appointing an ambassador may face liability if they fail to do so in accordance with international law.

### Potential Risks:

* **Interpretation and Dispute Resolution:** Ambiguity in the agreement regarding specific procedures, timelines, or definitions (e.g., "peaceful coexistence") may lead to disputes between the two governments.
* **Non-Compliance and Breach of Contract:** Failure to comply with agreed-upon obligations may result in damage to relations, loss of business opportunities, or even diplomatic crises.

### Relevant Case Law:

* The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) serves as a general framework for diplomatic relations. Article II, paragraph 5, addresses the issue of non-compliance and breaching diplomatic agreements.
* _Leyden v. Netherlands_ (1978), an English court case, highlights the importance of establishing diplomatic missions within the specified timeframe.

### Statutory References:

* Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961)
* Treaty No. 1 between the Republic of the Philippines and Hungary (September 28, 1973)

### Contingent Clauses:

* **"mutually beneficial relations"**: The agreement's emphasis on mutual benefits may create uncertainty regarding the exact scope of obligations or expectations.
* **"principles of peaceful coexistence"**: Lack of clarity surrounding this principle may lead to disputes over interpretation.

This summary highlights key aspects of the exchange of notes, potential risks and liabilities associated with its implementation, and relevant case law. However, it is essential for a lawyer to consult the original agreement and relevant statutes for a comprehensive understanding of the obligations and responsibilities outlined in the treaty.
