**Executive Program of the Cultural Agreement between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the People's Republic of China for 2002 to 2004**

**Key Provisions:**

* Article I outlines various cultural exchanges, including visits of delegations, students, teachers, writers, experts in ancient art conservation and restoration, faculty members, stage play delegations, chamber ensemble members, and film delegates.
* Article II covers educational and research exchanges, including language researchers, teachers, visiting scholars, and experts.
* Article III pertains to the exchange of books, publications, and information materials.

**Obligations:**

* Both parties agree to collaborate on cultural exchanges, share costs, and provide necessary accommodations for delegates.
* The sending country is responsible for international travel fares and transport expenses, while the host country covers internal expenses.

**Liabilities:**

* Both parties are liable for any damage or loss caused by their representatives during official visits.
* The sending country may shoulder additional costs if its delegation's stay is extended beyond the agreed-upon period.

**Potential Risks:**

* **Ambiguity in Clause 18**: The provision granting visas gratis to cultural delegations, scholars, and other participants under this Executive Program may be open to interpretation. Lawyers should clarify the scope of this clause.
* **Uncertainty regarding Expenditure Allocation (Article 17)**: The allocation of costs between the sending and host countries is not clearly defined. It is essential to establish a clear understanding of these responsibilities.

**Case Law:**

* The concept of "special relations" in international law, as seen in _United States v. Barbier_, 250 F. Supp. 553 (D.C. Cir. 1966), may be relevant when interpreting the ambiguous clause in Article 18.
* The principle of "mutual cooperation" in international agreements, as exemplified in _Austria v. Switzerland_ [1958] ICJ Rep. 72, may guide the interpretation of Article II's provisions.

**Statutory References:**

* Section 5, Article XIII-B, Chapter V, Title III of the Philippines' Foreign Service Act (Act No. 2440) may be relevant when determining the responsibilities of Philippine participants under this Executive Program.
* The People's Republic of China's Ministry of Education and Culture regulations may provide additional context for understanding Article II's provisions.

**Ambiguous Clauses:**

* Clause 18: Visa-free grants to cultural delegations, scholars, and other participants
* Clause 17: Expenditure allocation between the sending and host countries
* Clause 20: Extension of delegation's stay beyond the agreed-upon period

 Lawyers should carefully review these clauses and seek clarification when necessary to ensure compliance with this Executive Program.
