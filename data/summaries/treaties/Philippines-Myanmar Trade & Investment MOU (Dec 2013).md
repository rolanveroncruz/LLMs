## Legal Summary: Philippines-Myanmar MOU on Trade and Investments (2013)

**Document:** Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for Cooperation in Trade and Investments (December 05, 2013)

**Parties:** Republic of the Philippines (RP) and Republic of the Union of Myanmar (Myanmar).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I (General Provision):** Establishes the framework for cooperation in trade and investment based on reciprocity and mutual benefit, subject to existing laws and regulations.
*   **Article II (Executing Agencies):** Designates the Department of Trade and Industry-Board of Investments (DTI-BOI) for the RP and the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration for Myanmar as responsible agencies.
*   **Article III (Areas of Cooperation):** Outlines non-exhaustive areas of cooperation including: commercial exchange expansion, favorable investment climate, information exchange, support for trade/investment promotion, and providing facilities for cooperative activities.
*   **Article IV (Facilitation of Investment):** Focuses on cooperation to facilitate investments by creating a favorable environment, streamlining procedures, disseminating information, establishing one-stop centers, strengthening databases, consulting with businesses, and providing advisory services.
*   **Article V (Consultative Mechanism):** Provides for consultations upon request regarding interpretation or implementation of the MOU.
*   **Article VI (Validity):** Sets a validity period of five years from the date of signing (December 5, 2013) and allows for amendment, modification, or extension by mutual consent.

**Obligations:**

*   The Parties are obligated to *endeavor* to cooperate in the areas specified in Article III and IV.
*   Each Party is obligated to designate an executing agency (Article II).
*   Each Party is obligated to engage in consultations if requested by the other Party (Article V).
*   The MOU explicitly states compliance is "subject to their respective existing laws and regulations," creating a significant limitation on enforceability.

**Liabilities:**

*   The MOU does not explicitly define liabilities for non-performance or breach. However, Article I creates a general obligation of cooperation. Failure to cooperate could be interpreted as a breach, though the practical consequences are unclear due to the lack of enforcement mechanisms and the phrase "subject to their respective existing laws and regulations." This could be seen as a "best efforts" clause rather than a strict obligation.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Enforceability:** As an MOU, it is generally considered a non-binding agreement. The language lacks concrete obligations and relies heavily on the goodwill and political will of both parties.
*   **Domestic Law Override:** The qualification "subject to their respective existing laws and regulations" (Article I) allows either party to avoid its obligations based on domestic legal constraints, effectively rendering the MOU's impact unpredictable. This can lead to a frustrated party and a perception of bad faith.
*   **Vagueness of Obligations:** The phrases "encourage," "promote," and "facilitate" are vague and open to interpretation. This vagueness creates uncertainty as to the actual extent of the parties' obligations.
*   **Political Instability/Policy Changes:** Changes in government or policy in either country could significantly impact the implementation and effectiveness of the MOU.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The principle that MOUs are generally non-binding must be considered. Although MOUs express a statement of intent, they are not legally enforceable in court. *[Cite cases such as the Philippines Supreme Court case of Jovito R. Salonga vs. Paquito Ochoa Jr., G.R. No. 191910, August 16, 2011, regarding binding force of international agreements.]*

*   Reference to the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the Union of Myanmar for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments signed on 17 February 1998 in Manila. provides context and indicates intent to build upon prior investment protections.

*   Philippines' Foreign Investments Act of 1991 (RA 7042, as amended) and related implementing rules should be considered in light of any investments made pursuant to this MOU.
**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "subject to their respective existing laws and regulations" is ambiguous. It is unclear whether this applies only to the initial implementation or if it allows either party to unilaterally terminate or modify their obligations based on subsequent changes in domestic law.
*   The level of "best efforts" required to achieve the stated goals is not defined.
*   The Consultative Mechanism (Article V) only applies "upon their request". This may not sufficiently address issues if a party refuses to engage in consultation.

**Overall Assessment:**

This MOU serves as a statement of intent to enhance trade and investment relations between the Philippines and Myanmar. However, its non-binding nature, reliance on existing laws and regulations, and vague language significantly limit its legal impact. While it establishes a framework for cooperation, its practical effectiveness depends heavily on the political will and good faith of both parties. The risks associated with this MOU are relatively low due to its non-binding character, but expectations regarding concrete outcomes should be tempered accordingly.
