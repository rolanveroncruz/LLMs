**Date:** June 06, 2013

**Parties:** Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines) and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Timor-Leste) ("Participants").

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Purpose:** Establishes a framework for regular policy consultations on bilateral, regional, and international issues of mutual interest.
*   **Scope:** Covers bilateral relations, cooperation, and regional/international issues. Expert working groups may be formed for specific matters.
*   **Consultation Level:** Undersecretary/Assistant Secretary level (Philippines) and Vice Minister level (Timor-Leste).
*   **Logistics:** Participants bear own round trip transport and accommodation costs. Host participant pays internal expenses for head of delegation and mutually agreed upon officials.
*   **Amendment:** Requires mutual consent.
*   **Duration & Termination:** Valid for 3 years, automatically renewed for successive 2-year periods unless either party provides written notice of termination via diplomatic channels at least 6 months prior to the intended termination date.
*   **Governing Law/Interpretation:** Silent on governing law. Interpreted under international law principles.
*   **Non-Binding:** As a MOU, it is likely non-binding but rather an expression of intent.

**Obligations:**

*   Hold regular consultations.
*   Mutually determine dates, venue, and agenda.
*   Exchange views on relevant issues.
*   Bear own expenses (subject to hosting arrangements).

**Liabilities:**

*   No explicit liability provisions. As an MOU, it doesn't generally create legally enforceable obligations. Failure to adhere to the consultation schedule likely won't give rise to legal claims.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Non-Binding Nature:** The MOU lacks specific enforcement mechanisms. Its practical effect depends on the good faith of the parties. Reliance on the MOU without a subsequent legally binding agreement carries risk.
*   **Vagueness of "Mutual Interest":** Broadly defined scope could lead to disagreements over the consultation agenda.
*   **Lack of Dispute Resolution:** No mechanism for resolving disputes arising from the interpretation or implementation of the MOU.
*   **Funding/Resources:** The MOU hinges on the availability of resources for travel and accommodation. Changes in budgetary priorities could impact implementation.
*   **Successive Renewal Clause:** While the MOU is automatically renewed absent notice of termination, changes in political administrations in either country might lead to non-renewal.
*   **Silence on Governing Law:** Failure to specify a governing law may create ambiguity. Interpretation would rely on general principles of international law and customary practice.

**Relevant Law/Case Law:**

*   **Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT):** While not a treaty itself, the VCLT may be referenced for interpreting certain provisions, particularly on good faith and intent, even if the MOU is considered non-binding.
*   **International Customary Law:** Principles governing international agreements and state practice are relevant in the absence of specific legal provisions.
*   **Case Law on MOUs:** Jurisprudence on the interpretation and enforcement of MOUs in international law is relevant. Courts typically examine intent and surrounding circumstances to determine the legal effect of an MOU.

**Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   "Issues of mutual interest" is broad and potentially contentious if parties disagree on what constitutes "mutual interest".
*   The definition and scope of "internal expenses" borne by the host Participant could be subject to dispute.
*   Paragraph 4, regarding automatic renewal, could be perceived as ambiguous. "Intended date of termination" may need further clarification.
