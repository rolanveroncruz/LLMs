**Legal Summary: Rider N° 2 to the Financing Agreement (NIPAP) - Philippines & European Community**

**Date:** September 7, 2000

**Parties:** The European Community (THE COMMISSION) and The Republic of the Philippines (THE RECIPIENT).

**Subject Matter:** Amendment to the financing agreement for the National Integrated Protected Areas Programme (NIPAP).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 2 (Commitment of the Community):** This significantly revises the financial commitment.
    *   The EC Grant is fixed at **€11,000,000**.
    *   The COMMISSION retains discretion to grant extensions to the final implementation date upon justified request from THE RECIPIENT.
    *   Extends the implementation period to **March 31, 2001**, and the validity of the Memorandum to **March 31, 2003**, to allow for payment processing and evaluations related to project closure.
*   **Annex A (Modified Technical and Administrative Provisions):**
    *   **1.4 Costs and Financing:** Total project cost is estimated at **€12,700,000.**
    *   **2.3 Time Schedule:** Extends project implementation period to **5.5 years** from the date of the technical assistance contract signature, including 12 months for inception activities.
    *   **2.5 Cost Estimates:** Provides a detailed budget breakdown for the EC Grant across various categories (Field Activities, Training, Vehicles, Personnel, Technical Assistance, Contingencies), showing adjustments made by Rider N° 2, all totaling €11,000,000.
    *   **2.8 Procurement Procedures:** Mandates compliance with the "Manual of Instructions for contracts concluded for the purpose of Community co-operation with third countries" (Commission, Nov. 10, 1999) for services, works, and supplies contracts.  References local contracting tables (1, 2, and 3, Attachment 1 - *not provided, needs review*).

**Obligations:**

*   **THE COMMISSION:** To provide the EC Grant of €11,000,000.
*   **THE RECIPIENT:** To implement the NIPAP project, adhere to the implementation schedule (as amended), properly utilize the funds, and comply with procurement procedures.
*   Both Parties are responsible for adhering to any requirements in the contract with technical asistance (from the date of signature.)

**Liabilities:**

*   Non-compliance with procurement procedures could lead to disallowed costs or project suspension.
*   Failure to meet implementation deadlines could result in forfeiture of funds or breach of the agreement, unless extensions are properly requested and justified.
*   Mismanagement or misuse of funds could give rise to claims for repayment.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Attachment 1 (Procurement Tables):** The absence of Attachment 1 makes it impossible to fully assess the specific requirements for local contracting, a risk because lack of adherance can cause delays.
*   **Justification for Extension:** Vague wording around what constitutes a "properly justified" request for extension.  This could be a point of contention if THE COMMISSION denies an extension request.
*   **Manual of Instructions:** Need to review the "Manual of Instructions for contracts concluded for the purpose of Community co-operation with third countries" (Commission, Nov. 10, 1999) to fully determine procurement obligations and potential liabilities. *Important for THE RECIPIENT to review the manual.*
*   **Inception Activities:** It is unclear if failure of these activities will impact the project.
*   **Ambiguous wording** - ' depending on the circumstances' on page 1. This opens the COMMISSION to use their descretion.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   This is an international agreement, so applicable international law principles and any relevant Philippine law concerning government contracts will apply. The Financing Agreement itself (which this is a rider to) would contain governing law provisions. *The original agreement would need to be reviewed.*

**Further Action:**

*   Review the original Financing Agreement (including any initial riders) to understand the complete contractual framework.
*   Obtain and review Attachment 1 (Procurement Tables) to clarify local contracting requirements.
*   Obtain and review the "Manual of Instructions for contracts concluded for the purpose of Community co-operation with third countries" (Commission, Nov. 10, 1999).
*   Clarify the process and criteria for requesting and justifying extensions.
*   Ascertain what the ramifications are if the project is delayed by the 'inception activities.'
