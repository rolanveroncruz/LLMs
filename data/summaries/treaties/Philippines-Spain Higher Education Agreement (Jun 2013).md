*   **Interpretation Disputes:** Disagreements about interpretation or implementation of the agreement, specifically Article 3 (Recognition of Higher Education Studies and Academic Programs) regarding equivalence, could lead to disputes, as the agreement does not have specific resolution mechanism other than consultation.

**Relevant Statutory References:**

*   **Philippines:** Reference is made to "Education Acts" and regulations by the Commission on Higher Education of the Philippines. Specific Philippine laws governing higher education recognition should be examined (e.g., relevant sections of the Higher Education Act of 1994).
