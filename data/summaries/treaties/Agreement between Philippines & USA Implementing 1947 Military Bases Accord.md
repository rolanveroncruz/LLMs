This is an agreement between the United States and the Philippines, implementing Article V and XVIII of the Military Bases Agreement. The agreement addresses several key issues:

1. **Exemption from taxes**: The Philippine Government agrees to exempt imports of materials used in projects under the Military Bases Agreement from certain taxes and fees, including documentary stamp tax on negotiable instruments.
2. **Import licensing formality**: The Philippine Government has already approved the exemption of imported materials from import licensing formalities and fees for all materials and equipment consigned to US military bases in the Philippines.
3. **Use of local stocks**: The agreement emphasizes that materials used in projects under the Military Bases Agreement should be furnished from local stocks due to the urgency of the need for them.
4. **Replacement imports**: If replacement materials are imported, the Philippine Government will approve the application if they match the type and quantity actually utilized in US military projects.

The agreement also includes a statement that additional copies of documents required to support importations may be requested by the Philippine Government for their information and reference file.

The Supreme Court of the Philippines has cited this agreement as an example of a negotiated settlement between two sovereign nations, where both parties agree on specific terms and conditions to resolve disputes.
