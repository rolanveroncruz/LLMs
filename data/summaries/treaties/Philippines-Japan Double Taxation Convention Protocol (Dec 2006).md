## Summary of the 2006 Protocol Amending the Philippines-Japan Double Taxation Convention

This Protocol amends the 1980 Philippines-Japan Double Taxation Convention.  Key changes affect Permanent Establishment (PE) definition, Associated Enterprises (Transfer Pricing), Dividends, Interest, Royalties, and Tax Credit mechanisms.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article I (PE):** Replaces Article 5(6).  A PE is established if consultancy or supervisory services related to construction projects are furnished for >6 months within any 12-month period. *Exception:*  Services provided under economic/technical cooperation agreements between the governments.  This increases the risk of creating a PE for Japanese entities performing services in the Philippines and vice versa, except under government agreements. *Potential Issue:* Ambiguity in defining "connected projects," necessitating clarification in practice. *Case Law Consideration:* Interpretation hinges on facts demonstrating connection.

*   **Article II (Associated Enterprises - Transfer Pricing):** Replaces Article 9.  Mirrors the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.  Allows each contracting state to adjust profits if conditions between associated enterprises differ from those between independent enterprises. Includes a provision for corresponding adjustments by the other state upon agreement by competent authorities. *Obligation:*  Enterprises must conduct transactions at arm's length. *Liability:*  Potential for profit adjustments and tax reassessments if transfer prices are not arm's length. *Risk:*  Disputes arising from different interpretations of arm's length principle. *Statutory Reference:*  Comparable to Section 50 of the Philippine Tax Code and Japanese equivalent. *Case Law Consideration:* Local transfer pricing regulations and court decisions interpreting similar provisions.

*   **Article III (Dividends):** Replaces Article 10(2).  Withholding tax rate on dividends is capped at: (a) 10% if the beneficial owner (company) holds directly at least 10% of the voting shares or total issued shares for at least six months preceding payment; (b) 15% in all other cases. *Risk:*  Determining beneficial ownership to qualify for the lower 10% rate could be contentious.

*   **Article IV (Interest):** Replaces Article 11(2)-(8).  Withholding tax on interest capped at 10% of gross amount.  Exemption for interest derived by the government, central bank, or wholly-owned financial institutions of the other state, or guaranteed/insured/financed by such entities. *Risk:*  Careful definition is needed for "financial institution wholly owned by the Government" and "debt-claims guaranteed, insured or indirectly financed" to avoid disputes. Defines "interest" broadly to include income from debt-claims, government securities, bonds, and debentures.  Applies arm's length principle to interest rates, allowing taxation of the excess amount.

*   **Article V (Royalties):** Replaces Article 12(2).  Withholding tax on royalties capped at: (a) 15% for cinematograph films and radio/television broadcasting tapes; (b) 10% in all other cases. *Risk:*  Classification of payments as royalties can be disputed; careful contract drafting and interpretation of the term "royalties" per the convention is essential.

*   **Article VI (Tax Credit):** Replaces Article 23(3). Sets deemed-paid tax credit rates for dividends (20%), interest (15%), and royalties. *Limitation:* This deemed paid provision expires ten calendar years after this protocol came into force.

*   **Article VII (Non-Discrimination):** Replaces Article 24(3).  Guarantees deductibility of interest, royalties, and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of one state to a resident of the other state under the same conditions as if paid to a resident of the first state, except under Article 9(1), 11(7), and 12(7) (associated enterprises and non-arm's length transactions).

*   **Article VIII:** Deletes references regarding “it is proved that” in the protocol, strengthening application of the treaty.

*   **Article IX (Entry into Force and Application):**  Enters into force 30 days after exchange of diplomatic notes.  Applies to withholding taxes from Jan 1 of the following calendar year and to other income taxes for taxable years beginning on or after Jan 1 of the following calendar year. The deemed paid credit in Article VI expires ten calendar years after entry into force.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **PE Risk:** Expansion of PE definition increases the risk for businesses providing services related to construction or consultancy.
*   **Transfer Pricing Risk:**  Potential for disputes related to transfer pricing adjustments, requiring robust documentation.
*   **Beneficial Ownership:** Determining beneficial ownership of dividends, interest, and royalties may become a point of contention.
*   **Interpretation of Key Terms:** Ambiguity in terms like "connected projects," "financial institution wholly owned by the Government," and "indirectly financed" may lead to disputes.
*   **Expiry of Deemed Paid Credit:** The benefit of the deemed paid credit ceases after a specific period which must be tracked and considered in tax planning.

This Protocol requires careful consideration by businesses operating between the Philippines and Japan to ensure compliance and mitigate potential tax liabilities. Specific tax planning is crucial to leverage the benefits while minimizing potential risks associated with the revised treaty provisions.
