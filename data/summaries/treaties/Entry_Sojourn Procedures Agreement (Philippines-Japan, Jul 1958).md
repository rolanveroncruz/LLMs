## Summary of RP-Japan Agreement Concerning Simplification of Entry and Sojourn Procedures (1958)

**Nature:** Provisional agreement (modus vivendi) established via exchange of notes, simplifying entry and sojourn procedures for nationals of the Philippines and Japan on a reciprocal basis. In force since July 24, 1958, effectively August 1, 1958.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Simplified Visa Procedures (Para 1):**  Consular officers authorized to issue visas under simplified procedures to tourists, business visitors, persons in transit, media representatives, and their qualifying family members (spouses and unmarried children under 21).
*   **Favorable Consideration (Para 2):** Governments will give favorable consideration for visa applications of technicians (including prearranged employees), students, and other categories, based on individual merit.
*   **Numerical Limitation (Para 3):** Aggregate number of nationals from either country in the other is limited to 350, *excluding* specific categories: entrants under government agreements (salvage work), technicians (including prearranged employees), persons in transit, seamen/airmen, media representatives, family members of exempted individuals, and attendees of government-sponsored events (limited to 30 days).
*   **Undesirable Persons (Para 4):** Visas may be denied to "undesirable persons" as defined by domestic laws and regulations.
*   **Duration of Stay (Para 5):**  Initial stay for entrants (excluding tourists, seamen/airmen, persons in transit) should be six months whenever possible, with favorable consideration given for extensions up to one year, provided the original status is maintained. The period of stay for pre-arranged employees is determined in accordance with the laws of the host country.
*   **Treatment of Nationals (Para 6):** Nationals of either country will receive treatment no less favorable than that given to third-country nationals regarding travel facilities and customs inspection within legal limits.
*   **Reservation of Rights (Para 7):** The agreement is subject to all existing treaties, agreements, laws, and regulations governing entry, sojourn, and exit of aliens.
*   **Consultation (Para 8):**  Governments will provide sympathetic consideration and opportunity for consultations regarding matters affecting the application of the agreement.
*   **Diplomatic Passport Holders (Para 9):**  The numerical limitation and duration of stay provisions do not apply to holders of valid diplomatic, official, or special passports. Issuance of visas to these holders will be facilitated.
*   **Exclusion of Certain Pacific Islanders (Note III & IV):**  Agreement does not apply to native inhabitants of islands under US administration (pursuant to Article 3 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan signed at San Francisco on September 8, 1951) who lack valid Japanese passports.

**Obligations:**

*   Each government obligated to provide simplified visa procedures for specified categories.
*   Obligation to give favorable consideration to visa applications of technicians, students, and other categories.
*   Obligation to accord treatment to nationals of the other country no less favorable than that accorded to nationals of any third country in matters of travel facilities and customs inspection within legal limits.
*   Obligation to accord sympathetic consideration to, and shall afford adequate opportunity for consultation regarding, such representations as the other government may make with respect to any matter affecting the application of this agreement.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Broad Discretion:**  Terms like "favorable consideration" and "undesirable persons" are vague and susceptible to arbitrary interpretation, potentially leading to disputes over visa denials.  Reliance on domestic laws to define "undesirable" could create inconsistencies.
*   **Numerical Limitation Enforcement:**  Difficulty in tracking and enforcing the 350-person limit, especially considering the numerous exceptions.
*   **Supremacy Clause Issues:**  Paragraph 7 states that the agreement is "without prejudice to the application and enforcement of all existing treaties, agreements, laws and regulations of either country governing the entry, sojourn and exit of aliens", meaning national laws may supersede the provision.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Philippine Immigration Act:**  Relevant to the definition of "undesirable persons" and procedures for visa issuance, extension of stay, and deportation.
*   **Treaty of Peace with Japan (San Francisco, 1951):** Relevant due to the exception carved out for certain Pacific Islanders in Note III & IV.
*   **Philippine Constitution:**  The agreement must be consistent with the Supremacy Clause and any applicable provisions related to foreign relations.
*   **Relevant jurisprudence on treaty interpretation in the Philippines:** To determine intent and application of the Agreement.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Favorable Consideration":**  Lacks specific criteria, creating ambiguity.
*   **"Undesirable Persons":**  Definition dependent on domestic laws, potentially leading to inconsistencies and abuses.  See *Mejoff v. Director of Prisons*, 90 Phil. 70 (1951) regarding the concept of undesirable aliens under Philippine law.
*   **Numerical Limit Exceptions:** Wide-ranging exceptions undermine the effectiveness of the 350-person limit.
*   **"Sympathetic Consideration":**  This is a soft obligation with no clear enforcement mechanism.
*   **Prearranged Employees:**  The agreement does not define what is "prearranged" and merely refers to the domestic laws for the applicable period of stay.

**Recommendations:**

*   Clarification of terms "favorable consideration" and "undesirable persons" through subsequent agreements or implementing regulations to avoid arbitrary application.
*   Development of mechanisms for accurate tracking of nationals and enforcement of the numerical limitation, particularly regarding exceptions.
*   Review for consistency with current Philippine immigration laws and policies to avoid conflicts and ensure enforceability.
* Consider whether to update the provisions of this 66 year-old provisional agreement given substantial changes to the political and economic relationship of the two countries.
