To examine the possibility of sheep breeding in the Philippines to develop a wool type of sheep, we need to consider several factors. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Climate and Geography**: The Philippines has a tropical climate with high temperatures and humidity levels, which may not be suitable for sheep farming. Sheep require cooler temperatures and well-ventilated conditions to thrive.
2. **Feed Availability**: Sheep require a diet of grasses, hay, and grains. However, the availability of these feed sources in the Philippines needs to be assessed. The country's agricultural sector is primarily focused on rice production, which may not provide sufficient feed for sheep.
3. **Market Demand**: There is a growing demand for wool products in the Philippines, particularly from the textile industry. Developing a local sheep breed that can produce high-quality wool could create new economic opportunities.
4. **Technical Expertise**: The Philippine government and private sector need to collaborate with international experts to develop a sheep breeding program that can thrive in the country's climate and conditions.

Given these factors, here are some potential steps to consider:

1. **Conduct Feasibility Studies**: Conduct thorough feasibility studies to assess the suitability of different breeds for sheep farming in the Philippines.
2. **Collaborate with International Experts**: Collaborate with international experts in sheep breeding and animal husbandry to develop a breeding program that can thrive in the country's climate and conditions.
3. **Establish a Sheep Breeding Program**: Establish a sheep breeding program in the Philippines, which can start with a small pilot project and scale up as needed.
4. **Develop a Market Strategy**: Develop a market strategy to promote local wool products and create new economic opportunities for the industry.

In terms of developing a wool-type sheep breed, here are some potential considerations:

1. **Selecting Breeds**: Select breeds that are known for their wool production and can thrive in temperate climates, such as Merino or Rambouillet breeds.
2. **Cross-Breeding Program**: Develop a cross-breeding program to combine the best traits of different breeds and create a new breed that is well-suited to the Philippines' climate and conditions.
3. **Genetic Testing**: Conduct genetic testing to identify the genes responsible for wool production and other desirable traits, which can help develop a breeding program that can produce high-quality wool.

Overall, developing a sheep breeding program in the Philippines requires careful planning, collaboration with international experts, and investment in research and development.
