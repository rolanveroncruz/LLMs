## Summary of US-Philippines Agreement on Bank Facilities at Clark Air Base (1968)

**Nature of Agreement:** This is an agreement effected by exchange of notes between the US and the Philippines, entered into force on January 23, 1968. It concerns the establishment of a commercial branch of a Philippine bank (The Prudential Bank and Trust Company) at Clark Air Base, and the establishment of US Treasury facilities at Clark Field Air Base and Sangley Point Navy Base.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Establishment of Prudential Bank Branch at Clark:** The agreement grants consent for the establishment of a Prudential Bank and Trust Company branch within Clark Air Base. The US Government grants authority for this establishment, contingent on Philippine government consent.
*   **Philippine Regulatory Control:** The bank branch remains subject to all applicable Philippine monetary and banking controls, despite its location within the US Air Base. Philippine officials are permitted access to the base to examine the branch's operations in performance of their official duties.
*   **Establishment of US Treasury Facilities:** The agreement acknowledges the establishment of two US Treasury facilities, one at Clark Field Air Base and the other at Sangley Point Navy Base.

**Obligations:**

*   **US:** Grant authority to Prudential Bank and Trust to operate branch, subject to Philippine consent. Maintain operation of US Treasury facilities.
*   **Philippines:** Grant consent for the establishment of the Prudential Bank branch. Allow access to the bank by Philippine banking authorities. Ensure adherence to Philippine banking regulations.

**Liabilities:**

*   The agreement does not explicitly define liabilities. The Prudential Bank branch will be subject to usual commercial liabilities in accordance with Philippine laws. The US Treasury facilities would presumably be liable for their operation.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Scope of "applicable control by Philippine monetary and banking authorities":** The extent of this control needs further clarification. For example, what powers does the Philippines have to regulate the types of services offered or customer base served by the branch?
*   **Duration of Agreement:** The agreement does not specify an expiration date, which could lead to issues if base agreements are modified or terminated.
*   **Interplay with other agreements:** This agreement is intertwined with the Military Bases Agreement of 1947, as amended, specifically Articles XIX and XVIII. Any modification or abrogation of the Military Bases Agreement could impact the validity of this agreement.
*   **Access rights**: The scope of the access granted to Philippino officials need clarification, this could lead to conflict in some circumstance.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The jurisdiction for dispute resolution is not explicitly stated. Should conflicts arise, determining whether Philippine or US law governs could be contentious.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Military Bases Agreement of 1947 (as amended):** Articles XIX and XVIII are specifically cited as the basis for the agreement. *Republic of the Philippines vs. USA* can be used to see how the supreme court defined the application of this act.
*   **Philippine Banking Laws:** All applicable Philippine banking laws apply to the bank branch, though the specific laws are not named. This will include the *General Banking Law of 2000 (Republic Act No. 8791)* and circulars issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).
*   **U.S. Laws:** U.S. laws would also govern the operation of the U.S. Treasury facilities.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "all applicable control by Philippine monetary and banking authorities" is vague and could lead to disputes over the extent of Philippine regulatory power.

**Recommendations:**

*   Clarification of the scope of Philippine regulatory control.
*   Inclusion of a termination clause linked to the Military Bases Agreement.
*   Specify the governing law and dispute resolution mechanism.
*   Examine current legal status of cited articles (XIX and XVIII) of Military Bases Agreement to ensure compliance with all subsequent amendments and interpretations.
