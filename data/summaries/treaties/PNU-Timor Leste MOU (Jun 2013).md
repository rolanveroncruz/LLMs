**Memorandum of Understanding Analysis: Philippine Normal University (PNU) & Ministry of Education of Timor Leste (METL)**

**Date:** June 6, 2013

**Parties:**

*   **Philippine Normal University (PNU)**, represented by the Chairperson of the Commission on Higher Education.
*   **Ministry of Education of Timor Leste (METL)**, represented by the Minister of Education.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Purpose:** Establishes a framework for cooperation in teacher training and capacity building for METL's teachers and education officials. PNU will provide training programs, potentially customized.
*   **Scope:** Encompasses various degree and non-degree programs, specializations, and online programs.
*   **Obligations:** General obligation for PNU to provide teacher training programs and METL to engage in such training. Specific obligations require separate written agreements (addenda) before implementing specific programs.
*   **Liabilities:** The document does not explicitly mention liability clauses; however, liability may arise from the specific terms of each addendum created under the MOU. Potential liability could arise from breaches of contract related to program delivery, quality, or compliance with relevant regulations.
*   **Termination:** The MOU lacks a termination clause.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Vagueness and Lack of Specificity:** The MOU is very general, lacking details on program content, duration, cost, funding, admission criteria, performance standards, intellectual property rights, dispute resolution mechanisms, liability limitation, compliance, or applicable law.
*   **Enforceability:** As a "Memorandum of Understanding," its legal enforceability can be questionable under Philippine law, unless clear, definitive, and unequivocal obligations are specified in the addenda and can be construed as a contract. (See *Del Monte Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 90438, March 1992, which highlights the importance of intent and definiteness in contract formation)
*   **No Term/Expiration Date:** The absence of a termination clause or defined term creates uncertainty regarding the MOU's validity.
*   **Funding and Resources:** No mention of funding mechanisms or resource allocation.
*   **Liability** It is unclear if PNU can be held liable for damages that arise from teacher training or capacity building activities.
*   **Representation Authority:** The signatory for PNU, the Chairperson of the Commission on Higher Education, may raise questions of whether that person has explicit power of PNU to enter into the said MOU.

**Statutory/Case Law References:**

*   **Contract Law (Philippines):** The validity and enforceability of the addenda will be governed by the Civil Code of the Philippines regarding contracts (Articles 1305 et seq.). Elements of a valid contract (consent, object, and cause) must be present.
*   **Government Procurement Reform Act (RA 9184):** If the addenda involve procurement of goods or services by either party, RA 9184 may apply.
*   **Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Mandate:** Legal authority of PNU to enter into such MOU should also be determined by whether it complies with the university's charter.
*   ***Del Monte Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 90438, March 1992:** Case law on the factors of an enforceable contract

**Recommendations:**

*   Draft specific and legally sound addenda for each program or activity, addressing the identified ambiguities and risks.
*   Include clauses addressing funding, program content, quality control, intellectual property, liability, termination, choice of law, and dispute resolution.
*   Clarify representation authority and ensure appropriate internal approvals.
*   Conduct a legal review of each addendum before execution.
