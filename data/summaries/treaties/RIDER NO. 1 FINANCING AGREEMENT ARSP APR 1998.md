This appears to be a draft or proposal for a project implemented by the Philippine government, specifically in relation to agrarian reform. The document outlines the plan, budget, and implementation structure for the project.

Here's a brief summary of the key points:

1. **Budget**: The Philippine Government contribution will be made from national government budgetary resources.
2. **Implementation**:
	* The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) will be the executing agency.
	* A Project Management Office (PMO) will be established in Cebu to oversee project planning and implementation.
	* Three Provincial Project Offices (PPOs) will be established in Naga, Bacolod, and Butuan to implement project activities at provincial level.
3. **Project Structure**:
	* The PMO will report to the DAR's Support Services Office - Project Development and Management Staff (PDMS).
	* Each PPO will be headed by a Provincial Project Director appointed by the Secretary of DAR.
4. **Work Plan and Reporting**: Quarterly reports will be prepared by the Co-Directors, and annual reports on project achievements will also be submitted.
5. **Project Committees**: A Provincial Consultative Committee (PCC) will be established in each province to coordinate with various stakeholders, including field units, provincial governments, farmers' groups, and local NGOs.

Some specific details that caught my attention:

* The Philippine Government contribution includes funding for office space, normal salary costs of permanent personnel, and land acquisition.
* EU funds allocated to the project will be used for land survey activities.
* Boundary and segregation surveys will also be covered by the government's contribution, with a budget allocation of up to 1 million Pesos.

Overall, this document appears to outline a comprehensive plan for implementing an agrarian reform project in the Philippines.
