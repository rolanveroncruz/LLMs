## Summary of the Protocol to the PH-Germany Double Taxation Agreement

This Protocol clarifies and modifies certain provisions of the 2013 Philippines-Germany Double Taxation Agreement (DTA). Key aspects include:

**1. Article 2 (Taxes Covered):** Defines "supplements" to covered taxes, specifically mentioning the German solidarity surcharge ("Solidaritatszuschlag").

**2. Article 7 (Business Profits):**
    *   Clarifies profit attribution to Permanent Establishments (PEs) concerning sales of goods or services. Profit is based on the PE's **actual activity**, not the enterprise's total receipts. (Case Law: *Butler Bros v CIR* may be relevant regarding arm's length principle)
    *   For construction and installation contracts, profit attribution to a PE is limited to the portion of the contract effectively carried out by the PE in the host country. Supply of goods to the PE or activities in the head office's state are taxable only in that State.
    *   Specifies tax treatment for technical services. Payments for technical services, studies, or surveys fall under Article 7 (Business Profits) or Article 14 (Independent Personal Services), not Article 12 (Royalties), unless the primary purpose of the contract is the granting of industrial/commercial/scientific experience.

**3. Articles 8, 10, 25 (Shipping/Air Transport, Dividends, Non-Discrimination):**  Confirms that Article 8(2) and Article 10(6) do not violate the principle of non-discrimination under Article 25. This clarifies the application of source-country taxation of shipping income and dividends in specific scenarios and ensures consistency with anti-discrimination provisions (OECD Commentary on Article 25 relevant).

**4. Articles 10 and 11 (Dividends and Interest):**
    *   **Significant Modification:** Permits source-country taxation of dividends and interest from profit-participating rights or debt claims, including those of silent partners, profit-sharing loans, and profit-sharing bonds, even if Article 10 and 11 would otherwise limit it.
    *   **Critical Condition:** This source-country taxation is allowed only if such dividends and interest are **deductible** in determining the debtor's profits. This poses a potential challenge regarding the interpretation of "deductible" under both Philippine and German tax laws. (Relevant Statutory Reference: NIRC Sections on allowable deductions)

**5. Article 27 (Exchange of Information):**
    *   Limits the term "oversight" to the Philippine Congressional Oversight Committee under Section 290 of the NIRC of 1997.

**6. Article 27 (Exchange of Information - Personal Data):**
    *   Adds extensive provisions concerning the exchange of personal data. Key aspects include:
        *   Data usage restrictions.
        *   Conditions for use of data for other purposes.
        *   Accuracy and correction requirements.
        *   Information to the data subject.
        *   Liability for unlawful damage.
        *   Data deletion deadlines.
        *   Record-keeping obligations.
        *   Security measures.
    *   This section is significant because it imposes substantial obligations on both states regarding data protection, mirroring GDPR-like principles (though predating GDPR). It also creates potential liabilities for breaches of data protection. (Case Law: Considerations on damages for privacy violations may be relevant.)

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "Deductible" in Article 4:**  The condition that dividends/interest must be "deductible" to allow source-country taxation could lead to disputes if deductibility is interpreted differently under Philippine and German law.
*   **Data Protection Compliance:**  Meeting the requirements of Article 6 concerning personal data exchange poses a significant compliance challenge, especially regarding data accuracy, security, and notification requirements.
*   **Liability for Data Breaches:** Article 6(g) creates explicit liability for data breaches under domestic laws, exposing the receiving agency to potential lawsuits from affected individuals.
*   **Ambiguity in Technical Services Definition:** The distinction between technical services under Articles 7/14 and services ancillary to the grant of industrial/commercial/scientific experience under Article 12 could be contentious and lead to disputes over withholding tax rates.

**Recommendations:**

*   Thoroughly analyze the deductibility requirements under both Philippine and German tax laws to avoid potential disputes regarding dividend and interest taxation.
*   Implement robust data protection policies and procedures to comply with the strict requirements of Article 6.
*   Carefully draft contracts involving technical services to clearly define the primary purpose of the contract to avoid ambiguity in tax treatment.
*   Seek clarification from tax authorities in both countries on any ambiguous provisions of the Protocol.
