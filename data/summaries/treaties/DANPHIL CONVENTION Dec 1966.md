The convention outlines the terms and conditions under which citizens of one country can be taxed in the other country, including rules for taxing permanent establishments, foreign-owned enterprises, and individuals.

Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Non-discrimination**: Citizens of one country shall not be subject to more burdensome taxes than citizens of the other country.
2. **Territorial extension**: The convention can be extended to the Faroe Islands and Greenland if they have similar taxation systems.
3. **Entry into force**: The convention enters into effect after the exchange of ratifications, with different dates for the Philippines (January 1) and Denmark (April 1).
4. **Termination**: Either country can terminate the convention after three years, but this does not affect any modifications or amendments made during its life.
5. **Mutual agreement**: The Convention allows for mutual agreement to resolve difficulties or doubts arising from its interpretation or application.

Overall, this tax convention aims to promote economic cooperation and prevent double taxation between the Philippines and Denmark, while allowing both countries to maintain control over their taxation policies.
