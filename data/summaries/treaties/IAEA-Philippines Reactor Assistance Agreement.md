This is an excerpt from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and its Additional Protocol, specifically Annex B of the NPT which deals with Safeguards and Inspectors. Here's a summary of the main points:

**Safeguards**

1. The Philippines shall inform the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of its intention to transfer nuclear material listed in the Inventory.
2. The IAEA may apply safeguards in connection with the facility, but only if all necessary arrangements have been concluded.

**Transfer of Nuclear Material**

3. Nuclear material can only be transferred beyond the jurisdiction of the Philippines if agreed upon by the IAEA.
4. If any material or reactor is transferred, it shall be removed from the Inventory.

**Health and Safety Measures**

1. The Philippines shall apply the IAEA's Basic Safety Standards and relevant regulations to ensure safe conditions for radioactivity transport and handling.
2. A detailed health hazards report must be submitted to the IAEA at least 60 days prior to any transfer of material.
3. The Philippines shall also submit reports on nuclear safety as specified in paragraph 25 of the Health and Safety Document.

**Inspections**

1. The IAEA may inspect the reactor once during the first year of operation, and thereafter not more than once a year, subject to certain conditions.

This Annex is an integral part of the NPT and its Additional Protocol, which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and ensure safe management of nuclear materials.
