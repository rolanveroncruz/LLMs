It appears that you have provided a lengthy excerpt from an Annex of a treaty or agreement related to international organizations, specifically the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The annex outlines the rules and procedures for electing Directors to the IMF's Board of Governors.

To summarize, the annex provides guidelines for two different groups of Governors:

**Section A: Election of Directors by Governors representing regional members**

* 11% threshold above which votes are considered to have raised the total number of votes cast for a person.
* If any Governor casts all his votes for a person who is not elected, it will be counted towards the election.

**Section B: Election of Directors by Governors representing non-regional members**

* 25% threshold above which votes are considered to have raised the total number of votes cast for a person.
* If three persons are not elected at the first ballot, a second ballot is held where only Governors who voted in the previous ballot or whose votes raised the total votes for an elected person (above 26%) can participate.

The annex also outlines procedures for further ballots and adjustments to thresholds with increases in subscriptions or membership.
