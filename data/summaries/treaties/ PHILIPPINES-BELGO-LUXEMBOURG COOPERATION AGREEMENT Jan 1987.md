### Liability and Potential Risks

*   **Ambiguous Clause**: The agreement does not specify the scope of liability in case of non-compliance or breach of obligations. This ambiguity may lead to disputes between the Contracting Parties.

### Case Law and Statutory References

This agreement does not appear to have been directly cited in any notable case law or statutes related to international economic cooperation. However, it may be relevant to consider the following:

*   **General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)**: Article 3 of GATT emphasizes the importance of cooperation between countries in promoting economic growth and development.
*   **World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements**: The WTO's agreements on trade in goods and services, as well as intellectual property protection, may be relevant to this agreement.

### Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses

*   **Scope of Liability**: The absence of clear language regarding liability for non-compliance or breach of obligations creates uncertainty and potential disputes between the Contracting Parties.
*   **Termination Conditions**: While the termination clause provides a clear path for ending the agreement, it may be unclear how ongoing projects should be handled in case of termination.

1.  Clarify the scope of liability for non-compliance or breach of obligations.
2.  Provide specific guidelines for terminating ongoing projects in case of agreement termination.
3.  Establish a clear process for resolving disputes between Contracting Parties.
4.  Consider revising the agreement to address any ambiguities and ensure clarity on key provisions.
