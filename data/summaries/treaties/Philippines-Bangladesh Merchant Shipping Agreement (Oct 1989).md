## Summary of Philippines-Bangladesh Merchant Shipping Agreement (1989)

**Summary:** This agreement aims to promote and develop merchant shipping between the Philippines and Bangladesh, based on equality, mutual benefit, and freedom of merchant shipping. It covers vessel definitions, port access, cargo transport, treatment of vessels and crews, and cooperation in maritime affairs.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1:** General obligation to promote merchant shipping.
*   **Article 2:** Defines key terms like "vessel," "crew," and "ports," explicitly excluding warships, fishing vessels, and non-commercial vessels.  This definition could be challenged if there are disputes over vessel classification.
*   **Article 3:** Agreement applies to territorial seas but excludes certain activities like port services, pilotage, salvage, and fishing operations. This exclusion is subject to the laws of each party and could be a source of conflict if laws conflict.
*   **Article 4:** Encourages vessel participation in cargo transport, eliminating hindrances to shipping, cooperation in transporting goods to/from third countries, and improving seafarer welfare. Notably, rights of third-state vessels are preserved. Allows joint ventures subject to existing laws.
*   **Article 5:** Grants reciprocal Most Favored Nation (MFN) treatment to vessels, crews, and cargoes regarding port fees, services, and supplies. Broad language potentially encompassing a wide range of economic benefits.
*   **Article 6:** Aims to reduce administrative, customs, and sanitary formalities. Vague and aspirational; enforcement mechanisms unclear.
*   **Article 7:** Mutual recognition of vessel nationality and ship's documents. Explicit exemption from tonnage measurement if certificates exist. Reduces bureaucratic hurdles.
*   **Article 8:** Vessels, crews, etc., are subject to the national laws and regulations of the host country, particularly regarding safety, public order, customs, and health. Reinforces sovereignty and compliance with domestic law.
*   **Article 9:** Recognition of seafarer identity documents (Seaman's Record Book/Passport for Philippines, Continuous Discharge Certificate for Bangladesh) allowing visa-free entry for shore leave, repatriation, and joining vessels, subject to limitations in Article 10.
*   **Article 10:** Reinforces that national laws govern entry, stay, and departure of crews and vessels. Each party reserves the right to deny entry to undesirable seafarers.
*   **Article 11:** Addresses jurisdiction over offenses committed by crew members. Generally defers to the flag state, unless the offense affects security, public order, involves non-crew members, is a serious crime, or involves narcotics, or local authority assistance is requested. This article needs careful interpretation concerning the types of 'serious offences' warranting waiver of consent.
*   **Article 12:** Mentions the UN Liner Code of 1973 for freight sharing, permits profit transfers in convertible currency subject to exchange controls, and addresses taxation of seafarer earnings.
*   **Article 13:** Covers foreign exchange remittance rules and regulations. Includes an undertaing to allow the free transfer of earnings subject to the right of the Contracting Party to impose equitably and in good faith such measures, as may be necessary, to safeguard the integrity and independence of its currency, its external financial position and balance of payments, consistent with its rights and obligations as a member of the International Monetary Fund.
*   **Article 14:** Allows shipping organizations to establish permanent representations in the other country, subject to local laws.
*   **Article 15:** Allows diplomatic/consular personnel and shipping enterprise representatives access to ports and vessels.
*   **Article 16:** Deals with shipwrecks and accidents, providing for reciprocal benefits and assistance. Exempts salvaged items from customs duties if not consumed locally. Reserves salvage claims according to local laws. This is consistent with customary international law as articulated in the *Salvage Convention*.
*   **Article 17:** Preserves rights and obligations under existing international maritime conventions.
*   **Article 18:** Establishes a Joint Commission for reviewing implementation and discussing matters of mutual interest.
*   **Article 19:** Provides for dispute resolution through diplomatic channels, potentially involving the Joint Commission.
*   **Article 20:** Identifies competent authorities (MARINA for Philippines, Ministry of Shipping for Bangladesh).
*   **Article 21:** Sets the entry into force date 30 days after ratification notification and provides for termination with six months' notice before the end of a calendar year.
*   **Article 22:** Requires written agreement for any amendments.

**Obligations:**

*   Promote merchant shipping.
*   Grant MFN treatment regarding port access and services.
*   Reduce administrative burdens.
*   Recognize vessel nationality and documents.
*   Allow visa-free entry for seafarers under certain conditions.
*   Provide assistance in case of shipwrecks.
*   Resolve disputes diplomatically.

**Liabilities:**

*   Each party is liable for enforcing its own laws and regulations within its territory.
*   Potential liability for breaches of MFN treatment if discriminatory practices occur.
*   Liability for salvage operations is governed by local laws.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Vague Language:** Several provisions, such as "promote to the greatest extent possible" and "eliminate hindrances," lack specific metrics and could lead to disputes over implementation.
*   **Conflicting Laws:** The agreement relies heavily on national laws and regulations, which could create conflicts and inconsistencies in application, particularly regarding Article 3 (exclusions) and Article 8 (subject to national laws).
*   **MFN Interpretation:** The scope of MFN treatment in Article 5 is broad and may be subject to differing interpretations regarding what constitutes "no less favorable" treatment. This can potentially create commercial disputes.
*   **Jurisdictional Issues (Article 11):** Determining when an offense is "serious and objectionable" enough to waive the flag state's consent for prosecution can be subjective and lead to disagreements.
*   **Enforcement:** The agreement lacks strong enforcement mechanisms beyond diplomatic channels and the Joint Commission, limiting its effectiveness in addressing violations.
*   **UN Liner Code (Article 12):** Reference to the UN Liner Code may be outdated as it relates to cargo sharing. Further negotiations may be required to agree to current practices.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Philippines:** Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) enabling statutes and regulations regarding merchant shipping, port operations, and seafarer employment. Relevant jurisprudence on treaty interpretation and the relationship between international agreements and domestic law (e.g., *Pimentel v. Office of the Executive Secretary*, G.R. No. 158770, July 6, 2005 regarding treaty ratification).
*   **Bangladesh:** Shipping Ordinance, Port Acts, and relevant regulations governing maritime affairs.

**Recommendations:**

*   Clarify the ambiguous provisions through implementing regulations or memoranda of understanding.
*   Establish a clear process for resolving disputes related to conflicting laws or interpretations.
*   Develop specific metrics and benchmarks for measuring progress in promoting merchant shipping and eliminating hindrances.
*   Address potentially outdated references such as the UN Liner Code through negotiations.
*   Consider adding a mediation or arbitration clause for resolving disputes beyond diplomatic channels.
