This is a trade agreement between the European Economic Community (EEC) and the Philippines, specifically regarding textiles and clothing. The document appears to be an exchange of letters that outlines amendments to the original agreement in light of changes to the EU's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).

The key points of the agreement include:

1. Adjustments are made to the quantitative restrictions for textile exports from the Philippines to the EU, taking into account the potential accession of Austria, Finland, and Sweden to the EU.
2. The amendments aim to align the EU's trade practices with those in force before January 1, 1995, as a consequence of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.
3. The agreement updates models for certificates of origin, export licenses, and certificates applicable to certain cottage industry and folklore products.
4. The exchange of letters outlines transitional measures, including the provisional application of the amendments from January 1, 1995, until the entry into force of the revised agreement.

The document is formal and technical in nature, indicating that it was likely prepared by trade experts and diplomats involved in negotiations between the EEC and the Philippines.
