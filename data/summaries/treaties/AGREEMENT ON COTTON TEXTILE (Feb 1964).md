This text appears to be a simulated diplomatic exchange between the United States and the Philippines regarding the importation of cotton textiles into the United States. Specifically, it deals with the Philippines' export levels for certain categories of textiles in 1964.

The context is likely related to the Philippine-American Trade Agreement of 1962, which established certain trade relations between the two countries. The agreement includes provisions for adjusting export levels and tariffs on various textile categories.

In this exchange, the United States Secretary of State (Dean Rusk) and the Philippine Ambassador (Amelito R. Mutuc) discuss the terms of paragraph 5 of the Agreement, specifically regarding the Philippines' limit on exports for category 45 in 1964. The agreement allows for a certain level of increase above the traditional trade levels, but also includes provisions for adjusting this level if necessary.

The key points of the exchange are:

1. The Philippines agrees to limit its 1964 export level for category 45 to 30,000 dozens.
2. This level will not become effective until April 1, 1964.
3. Goods already in bonded warehouse in the United States by April 1, 1964, will be charged against this new export level, regardless of when they were exported from the Philippines.
4. If the actual amount of goods exceeds the agreed-upon limit, the United States will request consultations with the Philippine government to adjust the level.

The exchange is formal and follows a standard diplomatic protocol, with each party confirming the agreement and expressing gratitude for the understanding reached.
