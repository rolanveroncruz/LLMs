The text provided appears to be a translation of the International Parcel Post Regulations, specifically those between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States. These regulations outline the procedures for parcel post services between the two countries, including the rules for dispatching, receiving, and accounting for parcels.

Here is a brief summary of the key points in the text:

1. **Dispatching exchange offices**: The regulations specify that dispatching exchange offices must verify the contents of parcels and make up a Bulletin of Verification if any errors or irregularities are found.
2. **Parcel bills and corrections**: Dispatching exchange offices may return parcel bills with observations, but corrections made without supporting papers are considered invalid.
3. **Telegram advice**: The dispatching office may advise the sending office by telegram at its own expense.
4. **Duplicate parcel bills**: If there is a shortage of a parcel bill, a duplicate must be prepared and sent to the exchange office of origin.
5. **Damaged or insufficient parcels**: Receiving offices must repack damaged or insufficiently packed parcels, preserving the original packing as much as possible.

The text also outlines the terminal credits due to each country for parcels addressed for delivery in its territory:

1. The Philippines: 0.60 gold francs per kilogram
2. United States: varies depending on destination (e.g., $1.00 per kilogram for Hawaii, Alaska, and US territories)

Additionally, the regulations specify that Administrations may modify the details of these agreements by mutual consent.

The text includes a section on accounting, which requires receiving Administrations to submit accounts to dispatching Administrations within three months of the end of each quarter.

Finally, the regulations state that the detailed rules come into force on the same day as the Parcel Post Agreement and have the same duration. The Administrations concerned may modify these details by mutual consent.
