## Summary of Executive Programme for Broadcast Cooperation

This document is an **Executive Programme for Broadcast Cooperation** (the "Programme") between the Government Mass Media Group of the Republic of the Philippines ("GMMG") and Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting ("IRIB"), dated December 8, 2004. It implements the 1995 Cultural Agreement and a subsequent Cultural, Scientific, and Educational Exchange Programme between the two countries.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Cooperation Areas (A):** Covers exchange of media content (radio, TV, films, music, documentaries - *potentially raising content compliance issues under both national laws*), educational cooperation, information on technical equipment, facilitation of economic ties through information programs, participation in festivals, national day broadcasts, and film purchase information.
*   **Intellectual Property (B):** States that IP rights are governed by national laws and international conventions. *This clause is crucial and requires careful examination of applicable IP laws in both jurisdictions, potentially the Berne Convention, and the WIPO Copyright Treaty. Ambiguity exists regarding ownership of content co-produced or developed under the Programme.*
*   **Confidentiality (C & D):** Mandates confidentiality of information acquired and prohibits third-party disclosure without prior written consent. *This requires a clear understanding of what constitutes "confidential information" and the scope of permissible use. Potential for breach exists if interpretation is unclear. National security concerns of either state might supersede these clauses.*
*   **Funding (E):** Activities are subject to the availability of funds. *This provides a significant limitation on obligations. No minimum funding levels are specified, potentially rendering commitments unenforceable.*
*   **Dispute Resolution (F):** Disputes are to be settled through consultations or negotiations via diplomatic channels. *This clause prevents litigation in domestic courts and relies on diplomacy. Enforceability hinges on both partiesâ€™ willingness to negotiate in good faith. Consider the potential impact of the Iran Nuclear Deal framework on diplomatic relations.*
*   **Amendment (G):** Requires mutual consent for any amendment or revision.
*   **Effective Date (H):** Effective upon the entry into force of the underlying Cultural, Scientific and Educational Exchange Programme. *Verification of this effective date is necessary to determine if the Programme ever became operative.*
*   **Duration & Termination (I):** Valid for three (3) years, with termination possible upon written notice through diplomatic channels. *The original term has long expired. Any continued cooperation would require renewal or extension.*

**Obligations:**

*   The Programme creates primarily *soft law obligations*, emphasizing cooperation and exchange of information.
*   Binding obligations are limited by funding availability and the potential for termination.
*   Parties are obligated to maintain confidentiality and respect intellectual property rights.
*   Obligations to provide assistance for educational cooperation are contingent on mutually agreed terms.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Intellectual Property Infringement:** Sharing content could lead to copyright or other IP infringement claims if rights are not properly cleared. *Due diligence required to ensure compliance with copyright laws in both countries. Consider applicable laws regarding fair use or parody.*
*   **Breach of Confidentiality:** Unauthorized disclosure of information could lead to liability. *Detailed procedures are needed to safeguard confidential information. Consider laws relating to data protection, trade secrets, or national security.*
*   **Political Risk:** Changes in political relations between the Philippines and Iran could impact the Programme's viability. *Consider the impact of international sanctions or diplomatic tensions.*
*   **Enforceability:** The Dispute Resolution clause relies on diplomatic channels, potentially limiting legal recourse. *Consider potential lack of remedies if consultations fail.*
* **Content Compliance Risk:** Content broadcasted could be censored or banned due to violation of local laws or cultural norms. *Thorough vetting of shared media is crucial.*

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Philippines:** Copyright Law of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 8293, as amended), Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173), Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175).
*   **Iran:** Copyright Law of Iran, relevant laws regarding media regulation and censorship.
*   **International:** Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, WIPO Copyright Treaty.
*   *Case law concerning international agreements, diplomatic immunity, intellectual property disputes, and cross-border broadcasting would be relevant.*

**Ambiguous & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Scope of "confidential information."**
*   **Ownership and licensing of co-produced works.**
*   **Enforceability of the funding clause.**
*   **Interpretation of "interest of both parties" regarding content selection.**

**Recommendations:**

*   Conduct due diligence to confirm the effective date and operational status of the Programme.
*   Clarify the definition of "confidential information."
*   Establish clear procedures for intellectual property ownership, licensing, and clearance.
*   Develop protocols for content vetting and compliance.
*   Assess political and reputational risks associated with the Programme.
*   Consider drafting a more detailed agreement to address ambiguities and enhance enforceability, if the Programme is to be revived.

This summary provides a legal overview and highlights key considerations. A comprehensive legal review would require further research and analysis of relevant laws, regulations, and case law in both jurisdictions.
