**Protocol on Trade Relations Between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of China: Key Provisions, Obligations, Liabilities, and Potential Risks**

### **Introduction**

The Protocol on Trade Relations between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of China was signed on October 18, 1956. The protocol aims to promote and enlarge commerce and trade between the two countries.

### **Key Provisions**

1.  **Principle of Non-Discrimination**: Both contracting parties agree to give the same treatment to products included in any list agreed upon as that given to similar products when imported under similar terms and conditions from third parties.
2.  **Lists of Exports and Imports**: The protocol includes two lists: Annex A (Philippine exports to China) and Annex B (Chinese exports to the Philippines). These lists contain estimated trade volumes and are not binding commitments to import specific goods.
3.  **Exclusion of Non-Trade Articles**: The principle of non-discrimination does not apply to non-trade articles, such as military equipment or economic aid programs.

### **Obligations**

*   Both parties agree to facilitate the work of commercial representatives in each other's territories subject to local laws and regulations.
*   Parties are expected to accord each other customary facilities and refrain from discriminatory measures that could affect third-party countries.

### **Liabilities**

The parties are not explicitly liable for any breaches or non-compliance with the protocol. However, they may be held accountable for any damages caused by such actions under applicable laws and regulations.

### **Potential Risks**

*   **Ambiguous Language**: The protocol's language regarding the principle of non-discrimination and the exclusion of non-trade articles could lead to disputes and challenges in applying the agreement.
*   **National Security Concerns**: The protocol's exemption for military equipment and economic aid programs may be subject to reevaluation or challenge if national security concerns arise.
*   **Trade Imbalances**: The estimated trade volumes included in the lists (US$2,000,000 each) suggest a potentially significant trade imbalance between the two countries.

### **Case Law and Statutory References**

While this protocol does not have specific case law references, it is relevant to consider similar trade agreements and disputes involving the Philippines and China. The 1975 Trade Agreement Between the United States and China (TAC) and the 2018 US-China Trade Agreement may provide some insight into how similar principles of non-discrimination and market access are applied.

### **Conclusion**

The Protocol on Trade Relations between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of China aims to promote trade cooperation. However, its language and provisions require careful interpretation and analysis in practice.
