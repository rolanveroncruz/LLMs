*   **Contract Signature Deadline:** Contracts must be signed by 10/11/2006 (Article 5). *This is a hard deadline.*
*   **Beneficiary Obligations (Article 6):**

        *   Segregation of duties (authorizing officer and accounting officer)
        *   Effective internal control

*   **Governing Law and Order of Precedence (Article 8):** Special Conditions > General Conditions (Annex I) > Technical and Administrative Provisions (Annex II)

**General Conditions (Annex I) – Key Summaries:**

**Obligations:**

*   **Beneficiary (Philippines):** Financial contribution, project implementation, maintaining compliant financial management systems, preventing fraud/corruption, facilitating audits, adherence to procurement rules.
*   **Community (EC):** Financial contribution, oversight and monitoring of project implementation.

**Liabilities:**

*   Failure by the Philippines to meet the conditions for decentralized management could lead to centralized EC management.
*   Delays in payment requests caused by the Philippines could result in liability for late-payment interest.
*   Failure to prevent fraud or corruption could lead to suspension or termination of the agreement.
*   Non-compliance with audit requirements.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Strict Deadlines:** The deadlines for contract signature (Article 5) is critical and not extendable.
*   **Financial Management System:** Failure to maintain compliant financial management system (Article 6) puts the project at risk of suspension.
*   **Overruns:** Potential for cost overruns and the need to secure additional funding or scale down the project (Article 2, Annex I)
*   **Procurement:** Adherence to Commission procurement procedures is essential (Article 7, Annex I)
*   **Corruption/Fraud:** Risk of fraud or corruption during project implementation (Article 17, Annex I)
*   **Force Majeure:** Reliance on 'force majeure' clause is limited as defined in Article 21, Annex I.

**Statutory References/Case Law:**

*   The agreement references "the basic acts governing the cooperation sector concerned." Identification of these acts is necessary to fully understand the eligibility and participation rules.
*   **OLAF** and **Court of Auditors** verifications are governed by relevant EU regulations concerning protection of financial interests against fraud. Knowledge of these regulations is important for understanding the scope of these bodies' authority.
*   **Permanent Court of Arbitration Optional Rules for Arbitration Involving International Organisations and States:** These rules govern the arbitration process if it is invoked.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "beneficiary third countries" and "other third country expressly mentioned in those acts" needs clarification in Article 9 of Annex I.
*   The meaning of "substantial changes" in regards to Article 6.3, which may be hard to classify when reporting to the commission.
*   The phrase "due diligence" in the definition of "force majeure" is potentially ambiguous and subject to interpretation.

This summary highlights the critical aspects of the Financing Agreement. A more detailed analysis would require a review of the underlying EC regulations and relevant Philippine law.
