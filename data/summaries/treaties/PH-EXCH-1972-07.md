### Key Provisions:

*   The Agreement increased the Philippine quota for enlistment in the United States Navy from 45 per month to 166 per month, or 2,000 per year, beginning June 1972.
*   Philippine enlistees will be treated on the same basis as United States enlistees regarding compensation and prospects for advancement.

### Obligations:

*   The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) is obligated to inform the Embassy of the United States of America about the Philippine Government's position on the proposal.
*   The Embassy of the United States of America is obligated to inform the DFA about the Navy's readiness to increase the quota and the terms and conditions for accepted applicants.

### Liabilities:

    *   The Labor Code of the Philippines

### Potential Risks:

*   **Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** Clause 3 of the Agreement states that "accepted applicants will enter the Recruit Training Command with the rate of Seaman Recruit and will become eligible for any and all seaman and/or airman rates on an equal basis with United States citizen enlistees."
