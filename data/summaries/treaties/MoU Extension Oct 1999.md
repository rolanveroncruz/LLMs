### Obligations

* The signatory countries agree to cooperate on standards and conformance within the framework of ASEAN.
* Each country shall take all necessary measures to implement the provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding.

### Liabilities

* **Joint Liability**: There is no explicit provision for joint liability among the signatory countries. However, Article 10 of the original MOU suggests that the Parties may mutually determine procedures for additional signatories, implying a potential shared responsibility.
* **Indemnification**: No indemnification clause is apparent in this document.

### Potential Risks

* **Interpretation Ambiguities**: The phrase "according to the procedures to be mutually determined by the Parties" (Article 10) may lead to disputes regarding implementation and enforcement of standards.

### Relevant Case Law
