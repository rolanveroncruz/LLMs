**Joint Statement between the Republic of the Philippines, the Republic of Indonesia, and the Federation of Malaysia**

### Key Provisions:

*   The Manila Accord (June 11, 1963) outlines the principles for implementing the agreement, including a declaration known as the Manila Declaration.
*   The Heads of Government agreed to provide guiding principles for the implementation of the Manila Accord, which include the preservation of national independence and peace and security in the region.
*   Each country undertakes to have close consultations (mushawarah) among themselves on matters related to national independence and peace and security.
*   Foreign bases are to be used only for defensive purposes, and arrangements of collective defense are to be avoided.

### Obligations:

*   The Secretary-General is tasked with assessing the wishes of the people of Sabah (North Borneo) and Sarawak within the context of General Assembly Resolution 1541 (XV), Principle 9.
*   The British Government is requested to cooperate with the Secretary-General in carrying out his task.

### Liabilities:

*   The Philippines' claim to Sabah (North Borneo) remains a disputed issue, with the inclusion of Sabah in the Federation of Malaysia potentially prejudicing the Philippine claim.
*   Foreign bases may be used indirectly to subvert national independence if not properly regulated.

### Potential Risks:

*   **Ambiguous or contentious clauses:** The provision on foreign bases (paragraph 11) raises concerns about potential misuse, and the inclusion of Sabah in the Federation of Malaysia could prejudice the Philippine claim.
*   **Uncertainty around Sabah's future status**: The assessment of the wishes of the people of Sabah and Sarawak by the Secretary-General may be subject to interpretation or dispute.
*   **Risk of miscommunication or mistrust:** The close consultations (mushawarah) among the three countries may be vulnerable to miscommunication or mistrust, which could undermine cooperation and stability in the region.

### Relevant Case Law:

*   None directly relevant, but similar principles and provisions have been applied in international law disputes related to territorial claims and foreign relations.

### Statutory References:

*   **United Nations Charter**: Articles 1-6
*   **General Assembly Resolution 1541 (XV)**: Principle 9
