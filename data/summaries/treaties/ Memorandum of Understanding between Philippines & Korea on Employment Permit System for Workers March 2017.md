The Foreign Employment Act is a law in the Philippines that governs the employment and sojourn of foreign workers in the country. The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) and the Korean Embassy/Consulate General are the main agencies involved in this process.

The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) of the Philippines and the Ministry of Employment and Labor (MOEL) of South Korea outlines the terms and conditions for the employment and sojourn of Filipino workers in Korea. The MOU aims to strengthen cooperation between the two countries on employment and labor matters.

Key provisions of the MOU include:

1. **Dispatch of representatives**: The DOLE-POEA may dispatch representatives to Korea to facilitate the process of employment and sojourn management.
2. **Assistance to Filipino workers**: The HRD Korea will provide assistance to Filipino workers in Korea, including issuing certification of employment and supporting their insurance claims.
3. **Prevention and countermeasures against illegal stay**: Both parties will work together to prevent and counter measures against illegal stay of workers in Korea.
4. **Reciprocity on guarantee funds**: The Parties recognize the Foreign Employer Guarantee Fund (FEGF) of the Philippines as equivalent to the Guarantee Insurance of Korea taken out by the employer, and agree that only cases for unpaid wages will be governed by the latter insurance.
5. **MOEL's role in settlement of worker claims**: The MOEL will ensure that all claims of workers pursuant to the preceding paragraph will be continuously pursued and settled in Korea despite the departure of the Filipino worker.

The MOU also includes provisions on:

* Advertising key contents and employment procedures
* Assistance in advertising the EPS through various means
* Encouraging voluntary return of workers upon completion of their employment sojourn
* Regular exchange of information on measures to prevent and reduce overstaying workers
* Cooperation in implementing Returnee Support Program of Korea in the Philippines and Philippine OFW Reintegration Program

The MOU will come into effect on March 24, 2017, for a term of two years. However, it may be suspended or terminated by either party with three months' written notice.

Overall, the MOU aims to strengthen cooperation between the Philippines and Korea in employment and labor matters, ensuring the safe and responsible recruitment and deployment of Filipino workers in South Korea.
