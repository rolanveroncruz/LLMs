This is a document from 1961 that outlines an international treaty related to diplomatic relations. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, also known as the Vienna Convention, is a widely accepted set of rules and guidelines for the conduct of diplomatic relations between states.

The Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which this document is, specifically deals with the compulsory settlement of disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Convention. It provides a framework for the resolution of disputes through various means, including arbitration, conciliation, and judicial settlement.

Some key points from the document include:

1. The protocol is open for signature by all states that are parties to the Vienna Convention.
2. States can agree to extend the provisions of the protocol to disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Optional Protocol concerning Acquisition of Nationality.
3. The protocol provides for the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Convention, unless other forms of settlement have been agreed upon by the parties within a reasonable period.
4. States can agree to use arbitration or conciliation as an alternative to judicial settlement before resorting to the ICJ.

The document is signed by plenipotentiaries from various countries and has undergone several translations, including Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. The original of the protocol is deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who sends certified copies to all relevant states.

Overall, this document represents an effort by international organizations to establish a framework for resolving disputes related to diplomatic relations in a peaceful and efficient manner.
