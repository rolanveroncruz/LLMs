**Protocol Relating to an Amendment to the Convention on International Civil Aviation**
=====================================================

**Key Provisions**

### Article 45 of the Convention:

*   The full stop at the end of Article 45 is substituted with a comma.
*   The following phrase is added:
    ```markdown
and otherwise than temporarily by decision of the Assembly, such decision to be taken by the number of votes specified by the Assembly. The number of votes so specified will not be less than three-fifths of the total number of contracting States.
```
### Amendment and Ratification:

*   The amendment comes into force upon deposit of the 42nd instrument of ratification with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
*   The ICAO Secretary General shall immediately notify all contracting states of the deposit of each ratification.

### Obligations and Liabilities

*   Contracting states are obligated to comply with the amended Convention.
*   States that ratify the protocol after the specified date will have to deposit their instruments of ratification within a reasonable time frame.

**Potential Risks**

1.  **Ambiguous Clause:** The phrase "three-fifths of the total number of contracting States" may be subject to interpretation, potentially leading to disputes among member states.
2.  **Delays in Ratification:** Delays in depositing ratifications may impact the effective date of the amendment, potentially causing confusion and inconvenience for airlines and regulatory authorities.
3.  **Enforcement Mechanisms:** The Protocol does not specify enforcement mechanisms or penalties for non-compliance, leaving it to ICAO to address any disputes or breaches.

**Case Law**

*   None directly related to this protocol; however, similar cases involving international aviation agreements may be relevant to interpretation and enforcement of this protocol.
*   **ICAO Council Decisions:** The ICAO Council has issued numerous decisions interpreting the amended Convention. These decisions can provide guidance on applying the Protocol's provisions.

**Statutory References**

*   **Convention on International Civil Aviation (1944)**: The amended Convention is published in 320 UNTS, p. 209.
*   **ICAO Assembly Resolutions:** Assembly Resolution ADOC/13: This resolution approved the proposed amendment to the Convention and established the ICAO Council as the authoritative body for its interpretation.

**Ambiguous or Contentionous Clauses**

*   The phrase "three-fifths of the total number of contracting States" may be subject to interpretation, particularly in cases where the number of ratifying states is less than 42.
