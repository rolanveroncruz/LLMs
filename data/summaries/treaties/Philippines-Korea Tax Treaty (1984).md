## Summary of the Philippines-Korea Double Taxation Convention (1984)

This Convention, signed February 21, 1984, aims to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion on income between the Philippines and South Korea.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 1 (Personal Scope):** Applies to residents of one or both Contracting States. Protocol 1(a) retains the right of each state to tax its citizens residing in the other state per its domestic legislation, but 1(b) does not provide for credit by a Contracting State for taxes levied by the other pursuant to 1(a) above.
*   **Article 2 (Taxes Covered):** Covers Philippine income taxes and Korean income and corporation taxes. Applies to identical or substantially similar future taxes, with notification requirements for changes in taxation laws. Protocol 2 includes the Korean defense tax and Philippine corporate development tax.
*   **Article 3 (General Definitions):** Defines key terms such as "Korea," "Philippines," "resident," "company," "enterprise," "international traffic," and "competent authority." Uses a context-dependent approach for undefined terms, referencing domestic law.
*   **Article 4 (Resident):** Defines "resident" based on domicile, residence, head office, or similar criteria. Includes tie-breaker rules for dual residents based on permanent home, center of vital interests, habitual abode, and nationality, with mutual agreement procedure for non-individuals.
*   **Article 5 (Permanent Establishment (PE)):** Defines PE as a fixed place of business, including branches, offices, factories, etc. Includes a building site or construction project exceeding six months. Specifies activities that *do not* constitute a PE, like storage and purchasing. Establishes conditions for dependent agents and insurance enterprises to create a PE. Addresses issues regarding PEs and control between companies. This is critical for determining taxing rights on business profits.
*   **Articles 6-8 (Specific Income Categories):** Allocates taxing rights for immovable property, business profits (attributable to a PE), and shipping/air transport (generally taxable only in the state of the enterprise).
*   **Article 9 (Associated Enterprises):** Addresses transfer pricing issues, allowing adjustments to profits when conditions between related enterprises differ from those between independent enterprises.
*   **Articles 10-12 (Investment Income):** Sets maximum withholding tax rates on dividends (10% for companies holding >=35% capital, 25% otherwise, and potentially 10% for BOI-registered entities in the Philippines - Article 10; Protocol 5 allows a tax on remittance of profits by a branch office to its head office, up to 10%), interest (10% on public issues, 15% otherwise, and potentially 10% for BOI-registered entities in the Philippines- Article 11; Protocol 3 includes Korean Defense Tax and Philippine corporate development tax, it affects internal laws for payments to a head office), and royalties (15%, potentially 10% for BOI-registered entities in the Philippines - Article 12). Establishes exceptions where these articles do not apply if the investment is effectively connected to a PE or fixed base. Addresses issues regarding special relationships influencing income amounts.
*   **Article 13 (Capital Gains):** Generally, gains from immovable property can be taxed in the state where the property is situated. Gains from alienation of shares predominantly consisting of immovable property can also be taxed in the location of the property. Gains from international shipping and air traffic can be taxed only by the state where the enterprise is a resident.
*   **Articles 14-17 (Personal Services Income):** Addresses taxation of independent personal services, dependent personal services, director's fees, and income from artistes/athletes. Generally allocates taxing rights to the state of residence, with exceptions for fixed bases, longer stays, and activities performed in the other state.
*   **Articles 18-21 (Other Income Categories):** Allocates taxing rights for pensions, government service remuneration, students/apprentices, and professors/teachers.
*   **Article 22 (Other Income):** "Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State".
*   **Article 23 (Relief from Double Taxation):** Provides for credit mechanisms to alleviate double taxation. Korea allows credit for Philippine tax; the Philippines allows credit for Korean tax. It assumes flat rates for dividends and royalties. Protocol 6 states that the 25% tax credit applies only if tax rates imposed on royalties under domestic laws exceeds 25%.
*   **Article 24 (Non-Discrimination):** Prohibits discriminatory taxation based on nationality. Allows limitation of tax incentives to nationals in the promotion of industry.
*   **Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)):** Establishes a mechanism for resolving disputes regarding the Convention's interpretation or application, and for eliminating double taxation. Protocol 7 states that paragraph 2 will not prejudice the time limits prescribed in the domestic laws of each Contracting State.
*   **Article 26 (Exchange of Information):** Allows competent authorities to exchange information necessary for carrying out the Convention and domestic tax laws, subject to limitations for protecting trade secrets and public policy.
*   **Articles 27-29 (Final Provisions):** Addresses diplomatic privileges, ratification, entry into force, and termination of the Convention.

**Key Obligations:**

*   Contracting States must provide relief from double taxation as defined in the treaty.
*   Contracting States must exchange necessary information to prevent tax evasion and enforce the Convention.
*   Contracting States must not discriminate against nationals or enterprises of the other Contracting State.

**Potential Liabilities and Risks:**

*   **Interpretation Disputes:** Ambiguous clauses, especially regarding "permanent establishment" (Art. 5) and "beneficial ownership" (Articles 10, 11, and 12), could lead to disputes requiring resolution through the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP). The interpretation of Protocol 3 regarding the internal laws of Korea and the Philippines, and the applicability of article 7.3 in payments to a head office will also affect potential liabilities.
*   **Transfer Pricing:** The "Associated Enterprises" article (Art. 9) creates potential for scrutiny of related-party transactions.
*   **Treaty Override:** Changes in domestic tax law could potentially override treaty provisions (though subject to international law principles).
*   **Information Exchange:** While intended to prevent evasion, the exchange of information could pose risks to taxpayer confidentiality.
*   **PE Exposure:** Activities of employees or dependent agents in the other state may inadvertently create a permanent establishment, leading to unanticipated tax liabilities.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Relevant Philippine tax codes (NIRC) and BIR rulings will be relevant for interpreting Philippine provisions.
*   Similarly, relevant Korean tax laws will be relevant for interpreting Korean provisions.
*   OECD Model Tax Convention commentaries can provide interpretive guidance (though not binding).
*   Philippine Supreme Court decisions interpreting similar treaty provisions or tax concepts would be pertinent.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Beneficial Ownership":** The lack of a precise definition creates ambiguity and potential for treaty shopping.
*   **"Permanent Establishment" (Article 5):** The application of the PE definition to specific factual scenarios is often contentious, particularly regarding construction projects and the furnishing of services. Note that the time thresholds are relatively short.
*   **"Effectively Connected":** The phrase "effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base" in Articles 10-12 can be open to interpretation.
*    **"Lowest rate of the Philippine tax"** The term "lowest rate of the Philippine tax" in Protocol 4 includes a zero rate or exemption from Philippine tax which affects applicable tax.

**Conclusion:**

This Convention generally provides for reduced withholding rates and clarifies taxing rights between the Philippines and Korea. Careful consideration should be given to the PE definition, beneficial ownership requirements, and potential transfer pricing issues. Regular monitoring of changes in domestic tax laws is crucial to assess the ongoing applicability of the Convention. The Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) provides a mechanism to resolve disputes.
