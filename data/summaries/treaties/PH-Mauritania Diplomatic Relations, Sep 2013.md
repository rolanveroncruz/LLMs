Okay, here's a legally precise summary of the Joint Communique, formatted for a lawyer:

**Summary of Joint Communique: Philippines - Mauritania Diplomatic Relations**

**Document:** Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the Republic of the Philippines and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.

**Date:** September 30, 2013

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Establishment of Diplomatic Relations:** Officially establishes diplomatic relations at the Ministerial level between the Philippines and Mauritania.
*   **Governing Principles:**  Affirms adherence to the UN Charter, principles of international law, including: respect for international peace and security, state equality, national sovereignty and territorial integrity, independence, international treaties, and non-interference in internal affairs.
*   **Vienna Convention Applicability:** Explicitly invokes the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of April 18, 1961, thereby incorporating its provisions regarding diplomatic privileges and immunities, functions of diplomatic missions, and related matters.
*   **Authenticity of Texts:**  Provides for equally authentic Arabic and English language versions.

**Obligations:**

*   **General Obligations under International Law:** The Philippines and Mauritania are now bound by customary international law regarding diplomatic relations, as codified and expanded by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
*   **Obligation to Receive/Send Diplomats:** The agreement creates an expectation, but not necessarily an immediate obligation, to establish diplomatic missions in each other's territories.

**Liabilities:**

*   While this document doesn't create direct monetary liabilities, failure to uphold the principles of diplomatic immunity and privileges outlined in the Vienna Convention could lead to international disputes and potential claims of diplomatic impropriety.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Scope of "Ministerial Level":**  While establishing relations at the "Ministerial level" lacks specific definition, it may create an expectation that communication between the two countries will, at least initially, occur at the ministerial level.
*   **Implementation:** The Communique itself doesn't detail practical steps for establishing embassies, appointing diplomats, or negotiating specific agreements on trade, consular affairs, etc. The true meaning of this document lies in its practical implementation in relations between the two countries.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961):** This convention is the cornerstone of the agreement and defines the legal framework governing diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Mauritania. *See e.g.*, *United States v. Al-Hamdi*, 356 F.3d 56 (1st Cir. 2004) for discussion of the Vienna Convention.
*   **UN Charter:** Establishes the broader framework of international relations and the principles to which both states subscribe.
*   **Philippine Law:** Republic Act No. 75, as amended (Philippine Foreign Service Act), may be relevant in the context of implementation, specifically concerning the appointment and regulation of Philippine diplomats.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   There are no overtly contentious clauses *per se*. The document is a standard, relatively boilerplate agreement for establishing diplomatic relations. However, future disagreements could arise regarding interpretation or application of the Vienna Convention's provisions, or specific diplomatic actions taken by either state.

**Conclusion:**

The Joint Communique is a standard diplomatic instrument. Its legal significance primarily lies in its invocation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The key risk resides in potential disputes arising from the *application* of diplomatic privileges and immunities or other facets of diplomatic relations governed by the Vienna Convention. Further agreements and concrete actions (e.g., establishing embassies, appointing ambassadors) are necessary to fully realize the potential of this initial declaration.
