**Rider No. 4 to Financing Memorandum ALA/PH/8918 of 25 January 1990 Relating to Southern Mindanao Agricultural Programme (SMAP)**

### **Key Provisions:**

* The European Community (EC) and the Government of the Philippines agree on a closing period from 30 April 1998 to 31 August 1999 for completing outstanding SMAP activities.
* A consolidation period from 1 May 1998 to 31 August 1999 is designated to document SMAP development experience and prepare for the successor project.

### **Obligations:**

* The EC commits to providing funding for the successor project, subject to its agreement with the recipient government.

### **Liabilities:**

* No specific liabilities are explicitly stated in this rider. However, the EC's grant expiry date is set at 31 August 1999, which may imply that any outstanding claims against the EC will expire on this date.

### **Potential Risks:**

* Ambiguity surrounding the interpretation of the closing and consolidation periods, potentially leading to disputes between parties.
* Lack of clarity regarding the successor project's scope, objectives, or funding requirements.
* The risk of non-compliance with the agreed-upon terms, which may lead to termination of the agreement or loss of EC funding.

### **Case Law:**

* Not applicable, as this is a bilateral agreement between two governments rather than a contract subject to dispute resolution through courts.

### **Statutory References:**

* No specific statutory references are mentioned in this rider. However, the European Community's grant agreements may be governed by relevant EU directives and regulations, such as the EU Treaty or the Grant Agreement Regulations (EC) No 2004/18.

### **Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

* Article 2, Paragraph 3, is amended to set the EC grant expiry date at 31 August 1999. This clause may be subject to interpretation, particularly regarding what constitutes a "grant" and how it should be interpreted in the context of this agreement.
* The absence of clear definitions for key terms such as "successor project," "closing period," or "consolidation period" may lead to disputes between parties.

### **Recommendations:**

* The recipient government should carefully review this rider to ensure understanding of its obligations and liabilities under the agreement.
* The EC should confirm that it intends to provide funding for the successor project and clarify any ambiguities regarding the closing and consolidation periods.
* Both parties should consider seeking legal advice to resolve any disputes or uncertainties arising from this agreement.
