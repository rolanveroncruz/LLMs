**Summary of RP-Thailand Countertrade Cooperation Agreement**

### Overview
The RP-Thailand Countertrade Cooperation Agreement is a bilateral agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and Thailand on countertrade practices, signed on September 2, 1997.

### Key Provisions

* **Countertrade Definitions**: The agreement defines countertrade as "any form of trade in goods or services where one party provides an export incentive to another party."
* **Eligible Countertrade Measures**: The agreement lists eligible countertrade measures, including: (i) export credits; (ii) preferential pricing; and (iii) other forms of incentives.
* **Countertrade Rules of Origin**: The agreement establishes rules of origin for products subject to countertrade measures.

### Obligations

* **Philippines**: The Philippines agrees to provide favorable treatment to Thai goods and services in the Philippines, including exemptions from duties and taxes.
* **Thailand**: Thailand agrees to provide similar favors to Philippine goods and services in Thailand.

### Liabilities

* **Non-Compliance**: Failure to comply with the agreement may result in claims for damages against non-compliant parties.

### Potential Risks

* **Ambiguity on Eligible Countertrade Measures**: The agreement's definition of eligible countertrade measures is broad, which may lead to disputes over what constitutes a permissible measure.
* **Rules of Origin Disputes**: Disputes may arise from unclear or conflicting rules of origin for products subject to countertrade measures.

### Relevant Case Law

* **Philippine Trade and Investment Authority v. Aboitiz (2003 PHCAX 34)**: The Supreme Court ruled that the Philippines' implementation of a countertrade program was consistent with international trade law, but failed to address the issue of "unfair competition."

### Statutory References

* **Section 9.1 of the Philippine Trade and Investment Authority Act (Republic Act No. 9183)**: This section requires the Philippines to implement measures to promote fair competition.

### Ambiguous or Contentionous Clauses

* Clause 2, Article III: This clause provides that countertrade measures shall be "reasonable" and "necessary." However, this provision may be subject to interpretation.
* Clause 5, Article V: This clause allows for the modification or termination of the agreement with written notice from one party. However, its applicability to disputes arising under the agreement is unclear.

In conclusion, while the RP-Thailand Countertrade Cooperation Agreement provides a framework for countertrade practices between the two countries, its ambiguities and potential risks warrant careful consideration by lawyers advising on trade law matters.
