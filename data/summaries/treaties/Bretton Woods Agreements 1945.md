Here's a brief summary:

**Main points:**

1. The IMF will have a Board of Governors, comprising representatives from member countries.
2. Each country will appoint provisional executive directors to manage the organization until regular elections are held.
3. Seven elective executive directors will be elected through balloting by the governors, with provisions for multiple ballots if needed.
4. The voting system is weighted according to each country's subscription (based on its economic contribution).
5. The IMF will have a complex structure, including regional groups and committees.

**Governance:**

* Governors will elect executive directors for terms of 3 years, renewable.
* Executive directors will serve as the governing body of the IMF, overseeing its operations and making decisions on policy matters.
