This is a copy of the 1986 Budget Support Program agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States Agency for International Development (A.I.D.). The agreement outlines the terms and conditions of a budget support program, which provides peso budget support to the Philippine government to assist it in addressing its budget crisis.

Here's a brief overview of the agreement:

1. **Objective**: The objective of the Budget Support Program is to provide peso budget support to the Philippine government to help it finance its budget in selected priority categories.
2. **Scope**: The program will focus on the education, agriculture, and health sectors, but other budget categories may be considered based on mutual agreement between A.I.D. and the Philippine government.
3. **Restrictions**: National defense, equity for government corporations, and consumer subsidy budget expenditures are not eligible for funding under the program.
4. **Funding**: The program is funded under the Economic Support Fund (ESF) Program, with a total allocation of $475 million over the FY 1985-1989 period.
5. **Implementation**: The Philippine government will monitor the implementation of the program and report quarterly on its progress. A final close-out report will be provided upon completion of the program.

The agreement also includes provisions for:

* Representation of the parties (the Grantee, represented by the Director-General of the National Economic and Development Authority, and A.I.D., represented by the Director of the U.S. Agency for International Development Mission to the Philippines)
