This is a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Australia and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), outlining the framework for cooperation in various areas, including:

1. Intellectual Property Rights
2. Privileges of Australian and ASEan personnel involved in AAECP projects
3. Terms and conditions governing Australian and ASEan project supplies

The MOU aims to promote cooperation and mutual understanding between Australia and ASEAN member countries, particularly in the context of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) process.

Key points from the MOU:

* Intellectual property rights are respected, but AAECP projects do not have the power to waive these rights for other Australian Government departments or companies.
* The MOU does not prejudice existing international agreements on intellectual property protection.
* Privileges and terms and conditions governing project supplies will be negotiated between Australia and each ASEAN member country through an Exchange of Notes.
* The MOU can be amended by a new Exchange of Notes, but its initial term is set to end on June 30, 1998.

This MOU is part of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) process, which aims to promote economic growth and cooperation among APEC member economies.
