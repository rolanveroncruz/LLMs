This appears to be a project proposal from 1998 for an international development project funded by Canada International Development Agency (CIDA). Here's a summary of the project:

**Project Title:** Philippine Clean Environment and Economic Management Project (PCEEM)

**Location:** Metro Cebu and Davao City, Philippines

**Duration:** Five years (1998-2003)

**Objective:** To strengthen governance systems in Metro Cebu and Davao City to adopt innovative approaches to natural resource management, addressing environmental problems affecting their respective watershed ecosystems.

**Expected Results:**

1. Improved productivity and sustainability of watershed ecosystems in Cebu and Davao.
2. Establishment of a multi-sectoral, ecosystem-based approach to planning and managing environmental problems.
3. Creation of mechanisms for collaborative solutions between government, industry, and local community.
4. Capacity building within local government units (LGUs) and regional offices of the Government of the Philippines.
5. Introduction of Canadian environmental expertise and technology to address environmental problems.
6. Development of long-term linkages between public and private sector stakeholders and Canadian suppliers of environmental expertise and technology.

**Link to Country Development Policy Framework (CDPF):**

The project aligns with Canada's Official Development Assistance (ODA) priorities on environment, promoting responsible governance, building private sector capabilities, and strengthening democratic institutions.

**Development Approach:**

The project will employ an ecosystem-based watershed management approach, collaborative and integrated management, and capacity building. It will utilize facilitation skills of key decision-making organizations and technical expertise of Canadian partners to develop strategic interventions for addressing local environmental problems.

**Project Management and Organization:**

The project will be overseen by an Executive Committee, with a separate management board for each geographic component (Metro Cebu and Davao City). A Canadian Executing Agency (CEA) will administer the project, and a local Project Director (DENR) will assume joint responsibility.

**Budget:** Total cost of $10.7 million, with CIDA contributing $9.2 million and DENR contributing $1.5 million.

Overall, this project aims to promote sustainable environmental management in Metro Cebu and Davao City through a collaborative approach that involves government, industry, local communities, and Canadian expertise.
