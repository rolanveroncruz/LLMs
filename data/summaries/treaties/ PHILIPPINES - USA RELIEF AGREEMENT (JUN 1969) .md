This appears to be a copy of the agreement between the Government of the Philippines and American Relief Everywhere (ARE), also known as CARE, regarding the distribution of food commodities in the Philippines. The agreement outlines the terms and conditions under which the United States government will provide food assistance to the Filipino people.

Here are some key points from the agreement:

1. **Government responsibilities**: The GOVERNMENT is responsible for providing proper facilities for the handling, storage, and disposal of the commodities.
2. **Distribution supervision**: Distribution in the Philippines will be supervised by American citizens representing CARE, plus Philippine citizens employed by CARE.
3. **No imports**: No part of the commodities will be imported into the United States or its territories after distribution in the Philippines.
4. **Record-keeping and reporting**: The GOVERNMENT agrees to maintain adequate records and submit reports as requested by CARE.
5. **Liability protection**: The GOVERNMENT holds CARE harmless against any claims made by the United States Government due to failure to carry out its obligations under this agreement.

The agreement also provides for various benefits, including:

1. **Exemption from import duties**: Commodities, equipment, and supplies required for the administration of the program will be exempt from customs duties, taxes, wharfage, arrastre charges, and fees.
2. **Waiver of visa fees**: American representatives of CARE will be exempt from visa fees, immigration fees, head taxes, and other entrance, residence, or departure fees.
3. **Authorization to use unutilized funds**: The GOVERNMENT authorizes CARE to use unutilized funds for equipment purchases, materials, or travel expenses related to Department of Education personnel.

The agreement was signed on June 13, 1969, by the Secretary of Education and the Chief of Mission of CARE in Manila, Philippines.
