This appears to be a legal document related to customs procedures and tax exemptions for shipments arriving in the Philippines from the United States. Specifically, it is an order issued by the Commissioner of Customs on July 15, 1969, that outlines the rules and regulations governing the entry, examination, and delivery of cargo, as well as tax exemptions for certain types of shipments.

The document appears to be a response to a Note Verbal from the American Embassy, which likely requested clarification or modification of customs procedures related to military shipments arriving in the Philippines. The Department of Foreign Affairs has also approved this order, indicating that it constitutes an agreement between the two governments.

Key points from the document include:

* Military cargo and certain types of civilian goods are exempt from taxation and duties upon arrival.
* Shipments must be accompanied by a tax exemption certificate, which must be filed with the Collector of Customs within a specified timeframe.
* Collectors of Customs are instructed to expedite the processing of import documents for military shipments.
* The document outlines specific procedures for handling post-exchange and commissary shipments, as well as personal effects and household goods.

Overall, this order aims to simplify customs procedures for U.S. military personnel and their dependents, while also ensuring compliance with Philippine tax laws.
