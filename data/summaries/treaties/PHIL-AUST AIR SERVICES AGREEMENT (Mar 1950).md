This appears to be a series of letters and telegrams between the Australian Consul-General in Manila, J.K. Waller, and the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, specifically Atty. Simeon Roxas and Hon. Felino Neri, regarding air traffic rights for Qantas Empire Airways' civil air service to Japan via Manila.

The correspondence discusses several key points:

1. Traffic rights: The Australian authorities request that the Philippine Government grant limited traffic rights at Manila for their civil air service to operate between Australia and Japan.
2. Non-scheduled traffic: The Philippines agrees to allow Qantas Empire Airways to exercise non-scheduled traffic rights at Sydney and Darwin, in addition to transit rights over Philippine territory.
3. Air bilateral treaty: The Australian authorities propose the conclusion of an air bilateral treaty with the Philippines but note that there is no practical benefit for airlines of the Philippines at present.
4. Military air service: Qantas Empire Airways currently operates a military air service between Australia and Japan, which will be replaced by a civil air service once authorized.

The letters suggest a collaborative approach to resolving the issue, with both parties willing to negotiate an air transport agreement or air bilateral treaty to facilitate cooperation on air services in the region.
