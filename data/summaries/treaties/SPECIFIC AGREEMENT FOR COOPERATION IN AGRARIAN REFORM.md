This appears to be a draft agreement between the Government of Belgium and the Government of the Philippines for a cooperative project, likely related to agricultural development. The agreement covers various aspects such as:

1. Project scope and objectives
2. Financial provisions (covering salary costs, equipment, infrastructure, operating costs, etc.)
3. Management and monitoring arrangements
4. Evaluation and control mechanisms
5. Special conditions and final dispositions

The agreement is divided into nine articles, each addressing a specific aspect of the project. The document includes various clauses on matters such as:

* The establishment of a Project Office (PO) to oversee project implementation
* The formation of a Project Steering Committee (PSC) to provide policy guidance and oversight
* The involvement of Provincial Consultative Committees (PCCs) for technical consultation and coordination at the provincial level
* The responsibility of both governments for approving project workplans, reviewing progress, and providing policy guidance
* The joint evaluation mission to be organized during the third year of the project

The agreement concludes with provisions on the final dispositions, including its validity, cancellation, amendment, or extension.

It's worth noting that this is a draft document and may require revision and further negotiation between the two governments before it becomes an official agreement.
