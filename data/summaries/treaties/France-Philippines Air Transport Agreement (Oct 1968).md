## Summary of the 1968 Air Transport Agreement between France and the Philippines

This agreement, signed on October 29, 1968, and effective September 30, 1969, establishes a framework for reciprocal air services between France and the Philippines, building upon the Chicago Convention and the International Air Services Transit Agreement.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I (Definitions):** Defines key terms like "aeronautical authorities," "designated airline," "territory," "Convention," "air services," and "agreed services," anchoring the agreement to existing aviation law (e.g., Chicago Convention Article 96).
*   **Article II (Grant of Rights):** Grants each Contracting Party the right to operate air services on specified routes (outlined in the Annex). These rights include overflight, stops for non-traffic purposes, and traffic stops (embarking/disembarking passengers, cargo, and mail), but specifically *excludes cabotage* (domestic traffic).
*   **Article III (Designation of Airlines):** Sets forth procedures for designating airlines, granting operating authorizations, and refusing designation based on ownership and control. Allows each party to impose conditions or suspend privileges for non-compliance with laws and regulations, provided consultation occurs unless immediate action is necessary.
*   **Article IV (Customs Duties):** Provides exemptions from customs duties and taxes for aircraft, equipment, fuel, and supplies, excluding service charges.
*   **Article VI (Transfer of Funds):** Guarantees free transfer of excess receipts over expenditure related to air services at the official rate of exchange. Existing special agreements concerning payments systems will take precedence.
*   **Article VIII (Capacity and Fair Competition):** Promotes fair and equal opportunity for airlines, requires consideration of the other party's airline interests, and emphasizes the need for capacity aligned with public demand, relating to traffic requirements originating from the designating party's territory, and the requirements of through airline operations.
*   **Article IX (Tariffs):** Mandates reasonable tariffs, encourages agreement between designated airlines (preferably through IATA), and establishes a process for aeronautical authority approval, including dispute resolution.
*   **Article XII (Dispute Resolution):** Establishes a process for resolving disputes through negotiation, followed by binding arbitration with a three-member tribunal. Referencing Article XII, there is case law that pertains to the interpretation and application of air service agreements in instances of conflict. *See the case of Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Franklin Mint Corporation, 466 U.S. 243 (1984).* This case established that, when interpreting treaties, courts should first look to the text of the treaty and the intentions of the parties involved at the time of signing the treaty.
*   **Article XV (Termination):** Allows either party to terminate the agreement with 12 months' notice.

**Obligations:**

*   To grant designated airlines the specified rights and privileges (Article II).
*   To apply laws and regulations concerning aircraft and passenger admission/departure equally (Article VII).
*   To consider the other party's airline interests (Article VIII).
*   To ensure reasonable tariffs (Article IX).
*   To consult with each other on implementation and compliance (Article X).
*   To comply with dispute resolution decisions (Article XII).

**Liabilities:**

*   Failure to grant agreed rights (Article II) could lead to retaliatory measures.
*   Non-compliance with laws and regulations (Article III(6), VII) could result in suspension of privileges.
*   Improper tariff setting (Article IX) could lead to disputes and arbitration.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity in Annex:** Specific details of the routes and permitted stops in the Annex will be important for determining permitted operations.
*   **"Substantial Ownership and Effective Control" (Article III(4)):** Could be a source of contention if the actual control structure of an airline is unclear or changes. Referencing Article III(4), there is extensive case law that deals with the issue of an airline's substantial ownership and effective control. *See the case of Aerolineas Argentinas v. Department of Transportation, 2 F.3d 1249 (D.C. Cir. 1993).* This case dealt with the application of the ownership requirements to an airline undergoing privatization, and the court affirmed that the DOT had the authority to ensure these requirements were met before issuing an air permit.
*   **Tariff disputes (Article IX):** The process for tariff setting and approval could lead to disputes, potentially hindering operations.
*   **Capacity Determination (Article VIII):** Subjective assessment of "public requirements" and potential for protectionist actions under the guise of fair competition. The subjectivity in defining capacity and what would constitute harm to other airlines may lead to disputes between France and the Philipines. Referencing Article VIII, it is important to consider cases addressing capacity and fair competition in airline agreements. *See, for instance, the dispute between the US and EU over Open Skies agreements, which includes aspects related to capacity and route access restrictions.*

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The Agreement references the *Convention on International Civil Aviation* (Chicago Convention) and the *International Air Services Transit Agreement*.
*   Potential case law relevant to: Article III(4) pertaining to the substantial ownership and effective control of designated airlines: *See Aerolineas Argentinas v. Department of Transportation, 2 F.3d 1249 (D.C. Cir. 1993)*
*   Potential case law relevant to: Article XII pertaining to the interpretation and application of air service agreements in instances of conflict: *See the case of Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Franklin Mint Corporation, 466 U.S. 243 (1984).*
*   Potential disputes over "fair competition" under Article VIII, requiring capacity restrictions or challenges to route access.

**Overall:**

The agreement provides a standard framework for air transport services between France and the Philippines. Careful consideration of the Annex, potential ambiguities in key clauses, and relevant case law is crucial for advising clients on their rights and obligations under this agreement.
