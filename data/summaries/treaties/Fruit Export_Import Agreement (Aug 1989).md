## Memorandum of Agreement: Exportation/Importation of Fruits - Summary & Analysis

**Date:** August 30, 1989

**Parties:**

*   **Exporter:** Servicio Agricola y Ganadero (SAG), Chile, represented by Ambassador Carlos Desgroux.
*   **Importer:** Department of Agriculture (DA), Republic of the Philippines, represented by Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez.

**Subject Matter:** Agreement for the export of Chilean fruits to the Philippines.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Import Permit:** Requires import permits from the BPI Plant Quarantine Service for all covered fruits (including those for US bases, duty-free shops, etc.) (Clause 1).
*   **Covered Fruits:** Table grapes, apples, pears, stone fruits (peaches, nectarines, etc.), citrus fruits (lemons, oranges, grapefruits), and kiwi fruits (Clause 2).
*   **Cold Treatment:** Mandates specific cold treatment schedules (temperature and duration) to eliminate fruit fly risks, performed either pre-shipment or in-transit. Details standards to be followed. (Clause 3).
*   **Joint Inspection:** Requires joint inspection by SAG and BPI inspectors (5% random sample) to certify the absence of specific fruit fly species (Clause 4).
*   **Phytosanitary Certificate:** Requires a Phytosanitary Certificate from SAG certifying compliance with cold treatment and freedom from specific pests and diseases. Requires endorsement by BPI PQS officer. (Clause 5).
*   **Direct Shipment:** Limits entry to direct commercial shipments in container vans or ship holds. Prevents hand-carried imports. (Clause 6).
*   **Phytosanitary Control:** Strict measures including advance document exchange, sealing of cartons and containers with specific markings, seal control, and rejection for broken seals or discrepancies. (Clause 7).
*   **Cold Treatment Facility Requirements:** Specifies detailed requirements for cold treatment facilities, including sensor types, calibration procedures, and sealing protocols, both in-country and in transit. (Clause 8).
*   **BPI Officer in Chile:** Outlines working hours and compensation terms for BPI PQS officer assigned to supervise treatment and inspection in Chile. (Clauses 9 & 10).  Includes provisions for travel, daily and hotel allowance, overtime, and accident insurance.
*   **Amendment and Suspension:** Both countries reserve the right to amend the agreement. Allows for the suspension of shipments upon detection of fruit fly infestation. (Clauses 13 & 14) Agreement can be suspended upon deliberate/intentional violation of the agreement by SAG (Clause 15).

**Obligations:**

*   **SAG (Exporter):** Ensure proper cold treatment, inspection, and certification of fruit shipments; comply with phytosanitary requirements; facilitate BPI PQS officer's activities in Chile; bear the cost of officer deployment; and meet documentation and sealing requirements.
*   **DA (Importer):** Issue import permits; provide BPI PQS officers for inspection in Chile; receive and inspect shipments at the port of discharge; evaluate treatment data; and enforce rejection/return provisions for non-compliance.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Importer/Exporter:** Bear the expenses for rejected shipments (destruction or return to origin) due to broken seals, incorrect documentation, failure to meet cold treatment protocols, or pest/disease detection (Clause 7(d), 8(c)).
*   Implied: Potential liability for breach of contract damages if either party fails to uphold its obligations under the agreement. The agreement does not explicitly address dispute resolution mechanisms.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguous Language:** Some clauses contain potentially ambiguous language that could lead to disputes regarding interpretation of standards, or liability for costs if treatment fails and fruits are rejected. For example, the definition of "deliberate or intentional violation" in Clause 15 could be subject to interpretation.
*   **Enforcement Issues:** The effectiveness of the agreement depends on proper enforcement by both parties. Lack of effective monitoring, or insufficient resources to conduct thorough inspections could undermine the phytosanitary controls.
*   **Force Majeure:** The agreement lacks a force majeure clause. Unforeseen events (natural disasters, political instability) that disrupt trade could lead to breach of contract claims.
*   **Outdated Provisions:** Given the age of the agreement (1989), some provisions may be outdated or inconsistent with current international phytosanitary standards or trade regulations. Specifically, technology around cold treatment may be more sophisticated now.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Philippine Plant Quarantine Law:** (Likely applicable at the time of signing) Relevant for issues concerning plant health and pest control.
*   **Philippine Import Regulations:** General Philippine import regulations would apply to shipments under this agreement.
*   **General principles of contract law:** Will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement.
*   **International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) and WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement:** While not directly referenced, the principles underlying these international agreements on plant health and trade would be relevant to assessing the agreement's validity and applicability.

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Inspection Protocols (Clauses 4, 5, 7, 8):**  The specific inspection percentages, tolerances for defects/infestation, and approval processes for treatment facilities are crucial and may be points of contention.  Lack of clear, objective criteria could lead to disputes.
*   **Cost Allocation (Clauses 7(a), 7(d), 10):**  The agreement specifies how costs are allocated for certain activities, but the potential for unforeseen costs related to inspection, treatment failures, and rejected shipments warrants further scrutiny. The fixed rates stipulated in Clause 10 may need to be reviewed and potentially updated given the passage of time.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Review & Update:**  Recommend a thorough review and update of the agreement to align it with current international standards (IPPC, SPS Agreement), advances in cold treatment technology, and modern trade practices.
*   **Clarify Ambiguities:** Revise ambiguous language, particularly regarding liability, inspection criteria, and dispute resolution.
*   **Incorporate Force Majeure:** Add a force majeure clause to address unforeseen events.
*   **Dispute Resolution Mechanism:** Establish a clear dispute resolution mechanism (e.g., arbitration) to handle disagreements.
*   **Ensure Enforcement Capacity:** Verify that both countries have the necessary resources and infrastructure to effectively enforce the agreement's provisions.
