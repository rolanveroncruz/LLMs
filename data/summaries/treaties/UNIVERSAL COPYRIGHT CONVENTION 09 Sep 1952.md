The text appears to be the final act of the Universal Copyright Convention, adopted on September 6, 1952. The convention established an international treaty for copyright protection, which aimed to harmonize national laws and provide a framework for copyright protection across countries.

The text outlines the provisions and articles of the convention, including:

1. Article II: Provisions concerning protection against infringement
2. Article III: Protection of works having as their country of origin a country of the International Union created by the Convention
3. Resolution concerning Article XI: Establishment of an Intergovernmental Committee for copyright matters

The convention came into force on January 1, 1955, and was initially signed by 12 countries, including Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

The convention established a framework for international cooperation in copyright protection and provided a basis for the development of modern copyright laws. However, it has largely been replaced by newer international agreements, such as the Berne Convention (revised) 1971 and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).

The convention's text is an important historical document, providing insight into the evolution of international intellectual property law and the efforts made by countries to harmonize their copyright laws.
