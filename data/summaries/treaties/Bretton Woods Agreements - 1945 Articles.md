This is an excerpt from Article IV, Section 5 of the Bretton Woods Agreement, which established the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The agreement outlines procedures for exchanging currencies between member countries in certain circumstances.

Here's a brief summary of the main points:

1. **Notification and exchange**: A member country can notify the IMF of changes to its currency par value after 90 days without notification or by mutual agreement.
2. **Occupied territories**: If a member country's metropolitan territory is occupied by the enemy, the 90-day period is extended, and the IMF may impose conditions on currency exchanges.
3. **New monetary units**: If a member country adopts a new monetary unit before the date fixed for exchanging currencies, the IMF will use the new par value.
4. **Changes to par values**: Changes agreed with the IMF do not affect the eligibility of a proposed exchange transaction.
5. **Separate currencies**: A member country can communicate its par value for each separate currency in territories where it has accepted this agreement.
6. **Start of exchange transactions**: The IMF will begin exchanging currencies after 65% of members have become eligible to purchase other currencies, but not before major hostilities in Europe cease.

This excerpt is part of a larger document that outlines the procedures and guidelines for international monetary cooperation among member countries.
