## Summary of RP-Italy Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (1988)

This agreement between the Philippines and Italy aims to promote and protect investments made by investors of each country in the other's territory.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I: Promotion and Equitable Treatment:** Each party must promote investments by the other's investors, admit them according to their laws, and accord equitable and reasonable treatment.
*   **Article II: Definitions:** Defines key terms like "investment" (broadly defined including movable/immovable property, shares, claims, IP, concessions), "returns," "investor" (citizens or entities incorporated under national law with seat and management in their territory), and "territory" (including territorial sea).
*   **Article III: National Treatment:** Grants investments and returns treatment no less favorable than that accorded to investors of any third state regarding investments, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal. This does not apply to advantages from Customs Unions, Free Trade Zones, or double taxation agreements.
*   **Article IV: Expropriation:** Prohibits nationalization, expropriation, or equivalent measures except for public use/interest, including national welfare/defense, with prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. Compensation must equal the market value immediately before the expropriation became public knowledge, be made without undue delay, be effectively realizable, and freely transferable.
*   **Article V: Losses Due to Conflict:** Investors suffering losses due to war or armed conflict are entitled to treatment no less favorable than that accorded to investors of any third state regarding restitution, indemnification, or compensation. Resulting payments shall be freely transferable.
*   **Article VI: Free Transfer:** Ensures free transfer of investments, returns, liquidation proceeds, and earnings of nationals derived from work and services connected to the investment after taxes, and deductions of living expenses.
*   **Article VII: Subrogation:**  Addresses guarantees against non-commercial risks. If one party pays an investor under a guarantee, the other party recognizes the transfer of the investor's rights to the guaranteeing party.  Such transfer shall not exceed the original rights of such investor.
*   **Article VIII: Transfer Modalities:** Transfers stipulated in articles 4,5,6 and 7 will be made without undue delay, in accordance with laws and regulations and obligations of the international Monetary Fund, after the performance of fiscal burdens, at the official rate of exchange.
*   **Article IX: Dispute Resolution (Investor-State):** Disputes between a contracting party and an investor of the other country are to be settled amicably through negotiations. If no settlement is reached within six months, the investor may submit the dispute to the competent court or the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).  Diplomatic channels are barred until arbitration is concluded and a party fails to comply with the ICSID award.
*   **Article X: Dispute Resolution (State-State):** Disputes between the Contracting Parties regarding the interpretation and application of the agreement are to be settled through diplomatic channels. If not resolved within six months, they can be submitted to an ad hoc international arbitral tribunal.
*   **Article XII: Duration and Termination:** The agreement is valid for ten years, automatically extends for five-year periods unless denounced in writing one year before expiration, and remains effective for five years after termination regarding investments made before termination.
*   **Protocol:** Investments in the Philippines must be registered with the Central Bank of the Philippines and other appropriate government agencies. Compensation for expropriated property includes interest at the prevailing commercial rate. The agreement applies to prior investments if made in accordance with laws and regulations at the time and if registration requirements are met.

**Obligations:**

*   Each party must promote and admit investments.
*   Each party must provide fair and equitable treatment.
*   Each party must ensure free transfer of funds related to investments.
*   Each party must provide compensation for expropriation.
*   Each party must abide by dispute resolution mechanisms.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability for expropriation without adequate compensation.
*   Potential liability for failing to provide fair and equitable treatment.
*   Potential liability for restrictions on transfers.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity in "Public Use/Interest" (Article IV):** Scope for broad interpretation by the host state.
*   **Valuation of Compensation (Article IV):** Disputes may arise regarding the "market value" of investments.
*   **Scope of "Non-Commercial Risks" (Article VII):** Clarity needed on what constitutes non-commercial risks covered by guarantees.
*   **Requirement of registration with the Central Bank (Protocol (1)):**  It is necessary to provide what is required and the consequence of failing to register.
*   **Disputes over interpretation or application of the agreement.**

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **ICSID Convention (Article IX(2)(b)):** The agreement explicitly allows for arbitration under the ICSID Convention, implying a waiver of sovereign immunity.
*   **International Law on Expropriation:** While not explicitly cited, the principles of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation are consistent with customary international law. See *Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398 (1964)* and subsequent cases.
*   **Philippine Central Bank regulations:** (Protocol (1)) Philippine laws on foreign investment registration will be relevant in determining whether an investment falls within the treaty's scope.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Equitable and Reasonable Treatment" (Article I):** This is a common but vague standard.
*   **"Measures Having an Effect Equivalent to Nationalization or Expropriation" (Article IV(1)):** This indirect expropriation concept can be litigated and creates uncertainty.
*   **"Public Use or Public Interest" including "national welfare or defense" (Article IV(1)):**  These are broad terms that can be used to justify expropriation.
