2. Notification: States can notify the Secretary-General of the United Nations to withdraw their application of the convention at any time.
3. Registration: The United Nations is authorized to register the convention as soon as it comes into force.
4. Privileges and immunities: Members of the organization will enjoy certain privileges and immunities in connection with the organization.

The document also includes a appendix with information on:

1. Composition of the first council
2. Legal capacity, privileges, and immunities for members

The text is from 1948, indicating that it may be an early draft or original version of the convention.

It's worth noting that this document appears to be in a formal, diplomatic style, with phrases such as "Done at Geneva" and "In witness whereof", which are common in international treaties and agreements.
