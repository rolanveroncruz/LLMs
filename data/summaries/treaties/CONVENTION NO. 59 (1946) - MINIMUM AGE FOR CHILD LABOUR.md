3. **Entry into force**: The convention comes into force 12 months after the date on which the ratifications of two Members have been registered, or upon ratification by a Member that has already been in force for 12 months.
4. **Denunciation**: A Member can denounce the convention after the expiration of 10 years from the date it came into force, but must do so through an act communicated to the Director-General.
5. **Revision**: The Governing Body is required to present a report on the working of the convention every 10 years, and the General Conference may consider revising the convention in whole or in part.
