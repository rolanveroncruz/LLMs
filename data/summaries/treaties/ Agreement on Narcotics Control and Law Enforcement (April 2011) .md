This is a joint agreement between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GPH) and the Government of the United States of America (USG) regarding a loan agreement. The agreement outlines the terms and conditions for cooperation between the two governments in various areas, including:

1. **Tax Exemptions**: USG personnel and contractors performing work under this LOA are exempt from all taxes, tariffs, duties, or other levies in the Philippines.
2. **Privileges and Immunities**: The GPH is required to grant privileges and immunities to USG employees and contractors assigned to the U.S. Embassy, but not to citizens or permanent residents of the Philippines.
3. **Human Rights**: The Parties agree that human rights protection is an important element of this LOA, and that USG assistance to the GPH's narcotics and crime control effort is conditioned on the GRP (Government of the Republic of the Philippines) actively protecting human rights in the Philippines.
4. **Termination**: Either party may terminate this LOA by giving the other 90 days prior written notice, or may suspend its obligations under this LOA immediately upon giving the GPH written notice.

The agreement also defines specific crimes and offenses that would trigger termination of assistance, including narcotics offenses and drug trafficking.

Finally, the agreement outlines the entry into force of the LOA, which is April 19, 2011.
