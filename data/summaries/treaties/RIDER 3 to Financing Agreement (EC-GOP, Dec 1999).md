**RIDER N째 3 TO THE FINANCING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**

**Key Provisions:**

* The objectives of Rider N째 3 are to extend the duration of the project implementation period up to December 31, 2001, and adapt cost estimates and contributions by reallocation of funds.
* Article 2 of the Financing Agreement is modified to:
	+ Replace references to ECU with EURO from January 1, 1999.
	+ Set a final implementation date for the project, which may be extended upon request and proper justification.
	+ Establish a date limit for the commitment of the Community, set at December 31, 2002, for final reporting and settlement of outstanding payments.

**Obligations:**

* The Department of Health (DoH) is responsible for implementing the Health Component, which includes the construction of one provincial hospital in Agoo, La Union province.
* The Commission of the European Communities must:
	+ Provide financial provision of 13,502,000 EURO to support the Health Component.
	+ Ensure that the project is implemented until December 31, 2001.

**Liabilities:**

* The recipient (Government of the Philippines) is liable for:
	+ Ensuring timely payment of EC contributions.
	+ Complying with the modified terms and conditions of the Financing Agreement.

**Potential Risks:**

* Failure to meet the final implementation date may result in loss of funding or penalties.
* Delays in project implementation may impact the success of the Health Component and the overall project.

**Relevant Case Law:**

* None directly applicable, as this is a contract between the European Community and the Government of the Philippines. However, relevant case law on contract modification and extension may be cited in future disputes.

**Statutory References:**

* The Financing Agreement and Rider N째 3 are governed by EC law, specifically the Treaty Establishing the European Community (EEC) and the Financial Regulation.
* Philippine laws governing public-private partnerships and international agreements may also apply.

**Ambiguous or Controversial Clauses:**

* Article 2's reference to "final implementation date" is open to interpretation. The Commission must provide clarity on its intentions regarding this clause.
* The modified budget estimates in Appendix A.2 are subject to review, as they appear to be adjusted by significant amounts without clear justification.

**Recommendations for the Lawyer:**

* Review the contract modifications and ensure that all parties understand their obligations and liabilities.
* Monitor project progress and financial performance to prevent potential disputes or claims.
* Consider seeking guidance from EC law experts on the implications of Rider N째 3's modifications and potential risks.
