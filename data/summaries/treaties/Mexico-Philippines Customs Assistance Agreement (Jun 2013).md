## Summary of Agreement on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters (Mexico & Philippines)

**Document:** Agreement Between the United Mexican States and the Republic of the Philippines on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters.

**Date:** Signed August 31, 2012; Entered into Force June 15, 2013.

**Purpose:** To facilitate cooperation between the Customs Authorities of Mexico and the Philippines for the proper application of Customs Law and prevention, investigation, and repression of Customs offences, including protection of the international trade supply chain.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 2 (Scope of Agreement):** Outlines the scope of assistance including assessment of customs duties, enforcement of controls, and both proactive and reactive assistance. Assistance must adhere to national legal provisions and available resources. No private right to evidence is created. Arrests and collection of duties/fines are excluded.
*   **Article 3 (Form and Substance of Request):** Establishes the protocol for requests, emphasizing direct communication, written/electronic format, and essential information requirements (e.g., name of requesting authority, measures requested, object and reasons for request, and the applicable legal provisions.) It requires English translation, outlines procedures if requests don't meet formal requirements, and procedures if the requested Customs Authority is not the competent authority to obtain the requested information
*   **Articles 5-12 (Information Exchange):** Details types of information to be exchanged, including information on customs duties, restrictions, origin of goods, new enforcement techniques, trends in Customs offences, and risk analysis data. Includes provisions for automatic, advance, and systematic exchange of information.
*   **Articles 15-17 (Special Assistance):** Covers surveillance of goods and means of transport, and the presence of officials in the territory of the other party for investigative purposes. Outlines the advisory role and protections afforded to visiting officials.
*   **Articles 18-19 (Use, Confidentiality, and Protection of Information):** Restricts the use of information obtained under the agreement to administrative assistance purposes, subject to exceptions for legal proceedings. Mandates confidentiality and data protection standards equivalent to those in the receiving party's domestic law. Requires notification of changes in data protection laws.
*   **Article 20 (Exemptions from Assistance):** Allows refusal or conditional compliance with requests that infringe on sovereignty, security, public policy, or legitimate commercial interests, or conflict with domestic laws. Allows postponement due to ongoing investigations. Requires notification with reasons for declining or postponing assistance.
*   **Article 21 (Costs):** Generally waives reimbursement of costs, except for expert expenses, translators, and interpreters. Requires consultation for exceptional expenses.
*   **Article 23 (Dispute Settlement):** Mandates resolution of disputes arising from the agreement through mutual agreement between the Customs Authorities.
*   **Article 25 (Entry into Force, Amendment, and Termination):** Specifies entry into force upon notification of fulfillment of national legal requirements. Allows amendment by mutual consent. Provides for termination with three months' notice, without affecting ongoing cooperation.

**Obligations:**

*   Contracting Parties must provide mutual administrative assistance in customs matters.
*   Contracting Parties must maintain confidentiality of information exchanged.
*   Contracting Parties must inform each other of changes in data protection laws.

**Liabilities:**

*   Visiting officials are responsible for any offences they commit while in the other party's territory (Article 17(2)).
*   Each party is responsible for expenses related to their own officials, except for certain exceptions such as expert expenses, translators and interpreters.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Data Breach/Misuse:** Despite confidentiality provisions, the sharing of sensitive information carries inherent risks of breaches and misuse. Requires careful implementation of data protection protocols.
*   **Sovereignty Concerns (Article 20):** Broad exemptions based on "sovereignty, security, public policy, or other substantive national interest" could be invoked to limit cooperation, potentially undermining the agreement's effectiveness. The scope of "legitimate commercial interest" is also subject to interpretation.
*   **Differing Legal Standards:** Divergences in customs laws and administrative procedures between Mexico and the Philippines could create challenges in implementing the agreement and ensuring consistent application.
*   **Ambiguity of "Reasonable Grounds":** The threshold of "reasonable grounds" to believe that a Customs offence has been committed (Article 9) is subjective and could lead to disputes.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The agreement is framed with respect to the **obligations imposed under international conventions already accepted or applied by the Contracting Parties.** However, this is a high-level reference and specific conventions are not enumerated, thus leaving room for interpretation.
*   **Article 1** specifically references to the definitions of the territories of the Contracting Parties to its Political Constitution and the 1987 Philippine Constitution respectively. This means interpretations of the borders of the territories of the Contracting Parties can be directly tied to these two documents.
*   The enforcement of this agreement relies on the domestic Customs Laws of each country (defined in Article 1). **This Agreement would be subsidiary to the domestic customs laws of each party,** as Article 2(3) mentions any action is carried out in accordance with national legal and administrative provisions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The broad language of Article 20 regarding exemptions leaves room for potential disputes.
*   The definition of "Customs Law" (Article 1(3)) depends on the statutory and regulatory provisions relating to the importation, exportation, etc. This broad definition may create confusion and disagreement as to what laws fall under this agreement.
*   The provision on “legitimate commercial interest” (Article 20(1)) lacks clarity and could be subject to different interpretations.

**Recommendations:**

*   Clarify the scope of Article 20 exemptions through interpretive guidance or subsequent agreements.
*   Develop specific protocols for data sharing and protection to mitigate risks.
*   Establish a clear dispute resolution mechanism beyond "common agreement" (Article 23).
*   Maintain up-to-date knowledge of changes in customs laws and regulations in both countries to ensure compliance.
