The text is an excerpt from the Air Services Agreement between Japan and the Philippines, which was signed on January 20, 1970. The agreement governs air services between the two countries and provides for mutual recognition of licenses, routes, and other matters related to civil aviation.

The article in question is Article 17, which states that the agreement shall be approved by each contracting party in accordance with its constitutional procedures and shall enter into force on the date of exchange of diplomatic notes indicating such approval.

The text also includes a series of subsequent communications between the two governments, including:

1. A note from Ambassador Toshio Urabe to Secretary of Foreign Affairs Carlos P. Romulo, informing him that Japan has approved the agreement in accordance with its constitutional procedures.
2. An acknowledgement from Secretary Romulo, confirming that the Philippines has also approved the agreement and indicating that it enters into force on May 14, 1970.

The documents demonstrate the formal process by which the agreements are implemented and provide evidence of the mutual recognition and cooperation between Japan and the Philippines in the field of air transport.
