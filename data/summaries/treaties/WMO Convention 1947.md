This is a scanned copy of the original text of the Constitution of the World Meteorological Organization, which was signed on November 23, 1950. The document outlines the organization's structure, membership, and objectives.

Here are some key points from the text:

1. **Organization Structure**: The organization will be governed by a Council of Directors, which will be composed of one representative from each member country.
2. **Membership**: Membership is open to any country that has an independent government, territory with a population exceeding 10,000, and a national meteorological service.
3. **Objectives**: The organization aims to provide global coordination and cooperation in the field of meteorology, improve weather forecasting, and promote the development of meteorology as a science.
4. **Territories and Associations**: Territories and associations that have their own meteorological services are also invited to join the organization.

The document includes several annexes, including:

1. **States Represented at the Conference**: A list of countries that attended the 1947 conference in Washington, D.C., which led to the establishment of the World Meteorological Organization.
2. **Territories or Groups of Territories**: A list of territories and associations that have their own meteorological services and are invited to join the organization.

The document also includes a protocol concerning Spain, which allows Spain to accede to the organization once the Resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations is abrogated or no longer applicable.
