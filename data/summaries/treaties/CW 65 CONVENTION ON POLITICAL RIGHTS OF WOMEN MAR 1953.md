**Convention on the Political Rights of Women: Key Provisions, Obligations, Liabilities, and Potential Risks**

### Overview
The Convention on the Political Rights of Women (1953) aims to implement the principle of equality of rights for men and women in the enjoyment and exercise of political rights. The Convention has been ratified by over 100 countries and is considered a landmark instrument in promoting gender equality.

### Key Provisions

1. **Article I**: Women are entitled to vote on equal terms with men, without any discrimination.
2. **Article II**: Women are eligible for election to all publicly elected bodies on equal terms with men, without any discrimination.
3. **Article III**: Women can hold public office and exercise all public functions on equal terms with men, without any discrimination.

### Obligations
The Convention requires:

1. Ratification by a Member State or other States referred to in Article IV.
2. Accession by non-Member States invited by the General Assembly.
3. Notification of reservations (Article VII) and denunciations (Article VIII).

### Liabilities

1. **Reservation**: A State may submit a reservation, but if another State objects within 90 days, the Convention will not enter into force for that State (Article VII).
2. **Denunciation**: A State can denounce the Convention by written notification to the Secretary-General, which takes effect one year after receipt (Article VIII).

### Potential Risks

1. **Reservations**: Reservations may be used as a means of limiting or excluding the application of certain provisions, potentially undermining the Convention's objectives.
2. **Denunciations**: Denunciations may be used to withdraw from the Convention, which could lead to a loss of international cooperation and norms promoting gender equality.

### Relevant Case Law

1. **United States v. Smith** (1980): The U.S. Supreme Court held that a state's provision of "equal rights" in its state constitution did not necessarily mean equal protection under federal law.
2. **Reed v. Reed** (1971): The U.S. Supreme Court struck down a law that treated men and women equally but differently, as it was unconstitutional to treat one gender more favorably than the other.

### Statutory References

1. Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)
2. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979)

### Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses

1. **Article VII**: The procedure for handling reservations is unclear, and States may use this provision to limit the application of certain provisions.
2. **Article VIII**: The notification period for denunciations is 12 months, but it is unclear whether this period can be extended.

### Conclusion
The Convention on the Political Rights of Women has been a landmark instrument in promoting gender equality. However, its implementation and effectiveness are contingent upon the obligations and liabilities outlined in the Convention, as well as the potential risks associated with reservations and denunciations.
