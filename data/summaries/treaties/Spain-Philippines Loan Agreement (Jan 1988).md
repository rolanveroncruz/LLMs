## Loan Facility Agreement Summary - Instituto de Credito Oficial (ICO) & National Development Company (NDC)

**Document:** Loan Facility Agreement between Instituto de Credito Oficial of the Kingdom of Spain and the National Development Company of the Republic of the Philippines.
**Date:** January 9, 1988
**Parties:**
*   **Instituto de Credito Oficial (ICO):** Financial Agent of the Kingdom of Spain.
*   **National Development Company (NDC):** Financial Agent of the Republic of the Philippines.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan Facility:** US$10,000,000 granted by Spain to the Philippines (through NDC) to finance Spanish exports of goods and services. This is a "tied loan."
*   **Purpose:** Financing of Spanish exports for goods and services either as an individual transaction or as part of investment projects.
*   **Agreement Account:** A special account at ICO to record the flow of funds.
*   **Conditions Precedent:** Effectiveness contingent upon ICO receiving specific documents from the Philippines, including government resolution appointing NDC, specimen signatures, evidence of necessary authorizations, and certification from the Department of Justice.
*   **Allocation:** Specific capital goods exports and/or investment projects to be financed require mutual agreement by ICO and NDC within 12 months of the agreement coming into force. Subject to approval by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Finance.
*   **Drawdown Period:** 12 months from the approval of capital goods exports and/or investment projects; may be extended by mutual agreement. Undrawn amounts are automatically cancelled after the drawdown period.
*   **Drawdown Arrangements:**  Payments to Spanish exporters are made via payment orders or documentary credits through a Designated Spanish Bank.  NDC authorizes ICO to repay the Designated Spanish Bank upon confirmation that the terms of the payment orders/documentary credits have been fulfilled.  ICO is held harmless regarding underlying commercial transactions.
*   **Interest:**  2% per annum for commercial transactions totally financed by the facility, payable semi-annually.  For partial financing, interest is determined on a case-by-case basis according to OECD consensus.
*   **Commitment Fee:** 0.25% per annum on undrawn amounts, starting 3 months after effectiveness.
*   **Repayment:** 25 years, including a 5-year grace period, for totally financed transactions, with 41 equal semi-annual installments. For partial financing, repayment is determined on a case-by-case basis according to OECD consensus. ICO will provide a repayment chart subject to NDC's approval.
*   **Prepayment:**  Permitted with Central Bank of the Philippines approval, subject to minimum amounts and increments.
*   **Late Interest:** LIBOR + 1% per annum on overdue amounts, maximum default period of 12 months.
*   **Events of Default:** Failure to repay, failure to pay under other ICO/NDC agreements, misapplication of loan, cancellation of financed transactions, declaration of moratorium on external debt to the Spanish public sector, adverse modification of authorizations.
*   **Demand Repayment:**  Upon default, ICO may demand advanced repayment of principal and interest, or declare commitments null and void.
*   **Undertakings:** NDC's obligations rank *pari passu* with other external debts, except for purchase money security interests and liens arising in the ordinary course of banking maturing within 1 year.
*   **Taxes and Expenses:** NDC to bear all taxes and expenses arising in its country.
*   **Governing Law & Jurisdiction:** Spanish law; jurisdiction of courts in Madrid.
*   **Covenants:** NDC to provide annual audited financial statements, copies of internal regulatory changes, notification of changes in authorized signatories, and yearly list of credits granted by other countries to the Government of the Philippines.

**Obligations:**

*   **NDC:** Repayment of principal, payment of interest and commitment fees, ensuring funds are used for agreed-upon purposes, providing required documentation, complying with undertakings.
*   **ICO:** Making the loan facility available, disbursing funds upon proper authorization, providing repayment chart.

**Liabilities:**

*   **NDC:** Liable for repayment of the loan, interest, commitment fees, and late interest. Subject to default and demand repayment.
*   **ICO:** Limited liability regarding the underlying commercial transactions.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **OECD Consensus:**  Vague terms regarding interest rates and repayment terms for partially financed transactions, dependent on "OECD consensus," creating uncertainty and potential for disputes. Requires scrutiny of the specific OECD guidelines applicable at the time of the agreement.
*   **Commercial Contract:**  The agreement repeatedly refers to a "Commercial Contract" or "whatsoever other document as may substitute same" which may introduce ambiguity regarding the scope of acceptable documentation and their legal validity.
*   **Force Majeure:** The document lacks a force majeure clause, which could impact repayment obligations in unforeseen circumstances.
*   **Spanish Law & Jurisdiction:**  Requires familiarity with Spanish law to properly interpret and enforce the agreement, increasing legal costs.
*   **"Tied Loan":** Limited to Spanish exports, potentially increasing costs and reducing competitiveness compared to an untied loan. This restriction might violate EU or WTO regulations if the Philippines was a member at that time.
*   **Waiver of liability of ICO** The agreement has several provisions, especially in relation to the Annexures that the ICO should not have any liability in the fulfillment of the underlying purpose of the loan. This may be challenged in a court of law.
*   **Currency risk:** The loan amount is stipulated in US dollars, hence the NDC is susceptible to currency fluctuation risks.
*   **Statutory References:**  The agreement references "Article 14 of the Law 13/1971 of June 19" of Spain. This law should be located and examined to understand the precise authority of Mr. Manuel Lorente Martinez.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Further research into Spanish laws and regulations related to ICO and its lending activities in 1988 is needed.
*   Explore jurisprudence related to *pari passu* clauses and their enforcement, particularly in sovereign debt contexts.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The broadly worded events of default, particularly Clause Fourteen (4), (5) & (6) could trigger demand repayment prematurely.
*   Clause Five (5) which releases ICO of any liability in payment orders may be challenged.

**Recommendations:**

*   Obtain legal opinions from both Spanish and Philippines counsel.
*   Clarify the "OECD consensus" terms.
*   Assess the financial health of NDC and its ability to meet its obligations.
*   Evaluate the enforceability of the choice of law and forum clause.
*   Evaluate whether the Philippines as a sovereign nation can be sued in court.
