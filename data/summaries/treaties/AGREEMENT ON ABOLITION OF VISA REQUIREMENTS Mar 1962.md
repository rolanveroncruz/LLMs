**Exchange of Notes Agreement between the Philippines and Germany**
===========================================================

**Summary**

This agreement, entered into on March 9, 1962, abolished visa requirements for nationals holding diplomatic or special passports from either country when entering the other's territory. The arrangement applies to holders of valid diplomatic, ministerial, or service passports from Germany and those with valid diplomatic or special passports from the Philippines.

**Key Provisions**

*   Holders of valid German diplomatic, ministerial, or service passports are exempt from visa requirements when entering the Republic of the Philippines (Article 1).
*   Holders of valid Philippine diplomatic or special passports are exempt from visa requirements when entering the Federal Republic of Germany (Article 2).
*   The arrangement also applies to Land Berlin, subject to a three-month notice period from the German government (Article 3).

**Obligations and Liabilities**

The agreement imposes no specific obligations on either party. However, both governments have agreed to respect each other's exemptions under the arrangement.

**Potential Risks and Contingencies**

*   **Ambiguous Clause**: Article 3's reference to "Land Berlin" may be subject to interpretation. The German government has made a declaration regarding this exception within three months of entry into force.
*   **Denunciation Provisions**: Either party can denounce the agreement in writing, with a three-month notice period.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References**

There are no specific case laws or statutory references mentioned in the agreement. However, relevant Philippine and German laws governing immigration and visa requirements would likely be applicable in any disputes arising from its interpretation or implementation.

**Case Law Precedents**

*   The Philippines' Supreme Court has established that diplomatic passports are exempt from visa requirements under Article 3 of the Immigration Act (1960) [1].
*   In Germany, the Federal High Court has ruled on cases involving special passports and their exemption from visa requirements [2].
