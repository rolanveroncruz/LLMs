**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Lawfully Admitted for Permanent Residence" (Article II):** This phrase may require interpretation based on each country's immigration laws.
*   **"Just Compensation" (Article III):** The determination of "just compensation" can be contentious and may be subject to dispute.

*   **Article XV regarding Maritime Law**: Requires clarification regarding contemporary international maritime law and potential conflicts of jurisdiction.
*   **Enforceability**: The treaty's age may raise questions about its continued relevance and enforceability, considering changes in international law and domestic legislation since 1948. It is crucial to check whether the treaty has been modified or superseded by subsequent agreements.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR):** While not directly applicable as a superseding treaty, the VCCR (1963) provides a more comprehensive framework for consular relations. Analyzing how this treaty compares and contrasts with the VCCR is crucial.
