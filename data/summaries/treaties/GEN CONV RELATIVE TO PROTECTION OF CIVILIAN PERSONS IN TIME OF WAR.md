It seems you've provided a large document with various resolutions and discussions from an International Red Cross Conference, likely held in 1955. The document is not a single model agreement on two questions but rather a collection of resolutions and recommendations adopted by the conference.

However, I can help you identify some key points and takeaways from the conference's discussions and resolutions:

1. **Identity documents for medical personnel**: The conference recommends that States and National Red Cross Societies ensure medical personnel have the necessary badges and identity cards.
2. **Protection of the Red Cross emblem**: The conference calls for strict measures to prevent misuse of the Red Cross emblem, which is essential for safeguarding its authority and protecting its significance.
3. **Technical study of communication between hospital ships and warships/military aircraft**: The conference recommends establishing a Committee of Experts to examine technical improvements in communication systems between hospital ships and warships/military aircraft to ensure maximum protection and efficiency.
4. **Hospital ship broadcasting and position reporting**: The conference expresses hope that all High Contracting Parties will arrange for hospital ships to broadcast their position, route, and speed whenever conveniently practicable.
5. **Prisoners of War (POW) communication facilities**: The conference requests the International Committee of the Red Cross to prepare specimen messages covering specific requirements for POWs to send telegrams or cables.

If you'd like to create a model agreement based on these discussions, I can help you draft a document that summarizes the key points and recommendations. Please let me know what specific areas you'd like to focus on (e.g., communication between hospital ships and warships/military aircraft, POW communication facilities, etc.).
