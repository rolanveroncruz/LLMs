This text appears to be an excerpt from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), specifically Article 8 of the Fisheries Convention, which deals with the reporting and verification of fishery data. Here's a breakdown of the main points:

**Article 5: Reporting**

* States are required to collect logbook data on catch and effort from vessels flying their flag.
* The data should be transmitted to the national fisheries administration and, where agreed, to subregional or regional fisheries management organizations.
* The data should be sent at sufficiently frequent intervals to meet national requirements and regional and international obligations.

**Article 6: Data Verification**

* States or subregional/ regional fisheries management organizations should establish mechanisms for verifying fishery data, such as:
	+ Vessel monitoring systems
	+ Scientific observer programs
	+ Vessel trip, landing, and transshipment reports
	+ Port sampling

**Article 7: Data Exchange**

* Flag states must share data with other flag states and relevant coastal states through subregional or regional fisheries management organizations.
* The data should be compiled and made available in a timely manner and in an agreed format to all interested states.
* The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations may also collect and disseminate data at the global level.

**Annex II: Guidelines for Precautionary Reference Points**

* A precautionary reference point is an estimated value derived through an agreed scientific procedure, corresponding to the state of the resource and fishery.
* Two types of reference points are used:
	+ Conservation (limit) reference points set boundaries to constrain harvesting within safe biological limits.
	+ Management (target) reference points meet management objectives.
* Precautionary reference points should be stock-specific to account for reproductive capacity, resilience, and other factors.
* Management strategies shall seek to maintain or restore populations at levels consistent with previously agreed precautionary reference points.

Overall, these articles and annex outline the requirements for reporting, verifying, and exchanging fishery data, as well as guidelines for setting precautionary reference points to ensure sustainable fishing practices.
