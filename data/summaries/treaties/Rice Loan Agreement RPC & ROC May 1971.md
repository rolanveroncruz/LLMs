This is a sample of a shipbuilding agreement between the Republic of China and the Philippines. The document outlines the terms and conditions for the delivery of rice from Taiwan to the Philippines, including shipping, insurance, and arbitration provisions.

Here are some key points from the agreement:

1. **Shipping**: The "LENDER" (Republic of China) shall deliver the rice at the designated unloading port, while the "BORROWER" (Philippines) shall be responsible for loading and unloading.
2. **Insurance**: The "BORROWER" shall take out insurance to cover theft, pilferage, and non-delivery risks, including a warehouse-to-warehouse clause.
3. **Arbitration**: Any disputes arising from the shipment shall be settled through arbitration in Taipei, with two arbitrators appointed by the parties involved.
4. **Force Majeure**: Nondelivery of rice due to unforeseen circumstances such as war, blockade, natural disasters, or strikes shall be considered a cancellation or extension of the agreement.
5. **Packing and Inspection**: The rice must be packed in new, sound polypropylene bags and inspected prior to delivery by an internationally recognized agency appointed by the "LENDER".
6. **Dunnage, P.V.C. cloth, Strawmats, and Wooden Ventilator**: These items shall be for the account of the "BORROWER".

The agreement also includes various clauses on miscellaneous provisions, such as the appointment of witnesses and the execution of the document.

This sample agreement is likely a real agreement between Taiwan and the Philippines, given the context of the diplomatic relations between the two countries at that time. However, without further information, it's difficult to determine the actual terms and conditions of this specific agreement.
