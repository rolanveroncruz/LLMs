This is a text of an administrative arrangement between Canada and the Republic of the Philippines regarding social security benefits, specifically related to pension, disability, and survivors' benefits. The arrangement aims to facilitate cooperation and exchange of information between the two countries on these matters.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Liaison Agencies**: Each country designates liaison agencies to handle correspondence and claims for benefits. For Canada, it's the Direction des equivalences et de l'administration des ententes de sécurité sociale, while for the Philippines, it's the International and Legislative Affairs Office of the Social Security System.
2. **Certificate of Coverage**: When a person works in one country under the other country's legislation, they must obtain a certificate of coverage from the liaison agency of that country. The certificate is sent to both countries' liaison agencies and the individual or employer as required.
3. **Retirement, Disability, and Survivors' Benefits**: Claims for benefits can be presented to either country's liaison agency, which then forwards them to the relevant institution in the applicable country. Liaison agencies must provide supporting documents and a liaison form with all claims.
4. **Reimbursement Between Institutions**: At the end of each calendar year, the first country's liaison agency sends a statement listing fees for medical reports produced on behalf or at the expense of the second country's institution to the latter's liaison agency.
5. **Forms and Statistics**: The arrangement allows for common agreement on forms and documents necessary for implementation and exchange of statistical data between both countries.

This administrative arrangement aims to streamline communication, processing, and exchange of information regarding social security benefits between Canada and the Philippines, ensuring efficient and effective cooperation in this area.
