This appears to be a proposal for UNICEF assistance to the Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development. The document outlines several research projects, training programs, and community development initiatives that the department wishes to undertake with UNICEF support.

The main components of the proposal are:

1. Research studies on child and youth welfare and community services.
2. Training for social workers in the Philippines, including a study of training utilization.
3. Development of a data-collection system.
4. Expansion of research activities to build a store of social work literature in the Philippines.

The UNICEF assistance requested includes:

* Two grants of P15,000 each (approximately $300) to support specific research studies.
* Honoraria for specialists to assist with special studies.
* Publication and printing of manuscripts.
* Equipment and supplies for community centers and the national social work laboratory and training center.

The total requested allocation from UNICEF is $84,000.

In comparison, the Philippine government has committed to providing a similar amount, although it will be gradually taken over by the government in subsequent years. The government's research budget and contractual-grants are currently P66,000 per annum, which is significantly lower than the proposed UNICEF allocation.
