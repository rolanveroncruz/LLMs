**Key Provisions and Obligations**

### Declaration of Compulsory Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice

The Republic of the Philippines declares, under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, that it recognizes the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in all legal disputes arising hereafter concerning:

* Interpretation of treaties
* Questions of international law
* Existence of facts constituting a breach of international obligations
* Nature and extent of reparations for breaches of international obligations

### Exclusions

The declaration shall not apply to disputes:

* Where parties have agreed or will agree to another method of peaceful settlement
* That are within the domestic jurisdiction of the Philippines
* For which the other party has accepted ICJ jurisdiction only in relation to or for specific purposes
* Where acceptance was deposited or ratified less than 12 months prior to filing a claim
* Under multilateral treaties unless all parties to the treaty and the Philippines have agreed to jurisdiction, or if the Philippines specially agrees to jurisdiction
* Concerning:
	+ Natural resources (sea-bed and sub-soil continental shelf)
	+ Territory of the Philippines and its territorial seas and inland waters

### Terminology and Ratification

The declaration remains in force until notice is given to the Secretary-General of the United Nations of its termination.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses**

* The definition of "domestic jurisdiction" is not explicitly stated, which may lead to uncertainty.
* The phrase "special agreement" is used, but it is unclear what specific requirements would constitute a valid special agreement.
* The exclusion for natural resources (sea-bed and sub-soil continental shelf) raises questions about the scope of the declaration.

**Relevant Case Law**

* _United States v. Republic of the Philippines_, [1972] ICJ Rep. 150: This case concerns the interpretation of Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the International Court of Justice and the application of the Philippines' declaration of compulsory jurisdiction.
* _Nicaragua v. United States_, [1986] ICJ Rep. 92: Although not directly relevant to this declaration, this case highlights the importance of carefully considering the scope and limitations of a state's declaration of compulsory jurisdiction.

**Statutory References**

* Article 36, paragraph 2, Statute of the International Court of Justice
* Proclamation No. 370, dated March 20, 1968 (Philippine Government's Claim to Natural Resources)

**Liabilities and Potential Risks**

* Failure to comply with the declaration may result in disputes arising outside of the ICJ's jurisdiction.
