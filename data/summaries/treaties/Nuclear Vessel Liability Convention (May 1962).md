I can help you identify who has provided financial security to the operator pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article III. 

According to Article III, paragraph 2, "Notwithstanding the termination of this Convention or the termination of its application to any Contracting State pursuant to Article XXVII, the provisions of the Convention shall continue to apply with respect to any nuclear damage caused by a nuclear incident involving the nuclear fuel of, or radioactive products or waste produced in a nuclear ship licensed of otherwise authorized for operation by any Contracting State prior to the date of such termination..."

The key phrase here is "prior to the date of such termination." This suggests that financial security has been provided to the operator before the termination of the Convention.

Unfortunately, I don't have more specific information about who provided the financial security. However, I can suggest some possible sources where you may be able to find this information:

1. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) website: The IAEA is a specialized agency of the United Nations that provides technical assistance and guidance on nuclear energy issues. They may have information on financial arrangements related to nuclear shipping.
2. The Convention's implementing agreements: The Convention has been implemented by various countries, which may have made provisions for financial security in their national laws or regulations.
3. International maritime law sources: There may be international maritime law texts or articles that discuss the financial security requirements for nuclear shipping.

I hope this information is helpful! If you have any more specific questions or need further assistance, please let me know.
