**Summary of Supplementary Agreement No. 17 (1958) between the Philippines and the UN Technical Assistance Board**

This agreement, supplementary to the Revised Standard Agreement of 1954, establishes a Statistical Center (the "Center") at the University of the Philippines (UP) with the goal of improving the country's statistical capabilities, particularly within government.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Establishment and Objectives (Article I):** Creates the Center under UP's jurisdiction to provide statistical instruction, demonstration, and services.  The Center is tasked with education in statistical methodology, sampling, government statistical coordination, data collection, census operations, and statistical analysis.
*   **Coordination Board (Article II):** Establishes a Coordination Board composed of key government secretaries and agency heads (e.g., Foreign Affairs, Finance, National Economic Council). The Board is responsible for in-service training programs and facilitating the Center's activities.
*   **Executive Committee (Article III):** Defines the composition and responsibilities of the Center's Executive Committee, including representatives from UP, the National Economic Council, the Bureau of Census and Statistics, and the Central Bank. The UN Principal Statistical Adviser is a member and rapporteur. The Committee is responsible for the Center's program, activities, and management.
*   **Professional Committee (Article IV):** Invites the Philippine Statistical Association to form a technical advisory committee to advise the Executive Committee.
*   **Duration (Article V):** Affirms the Government's intention to make the Center a permanent institution, with a commitment not to terminate activities within five years without UN consultation. The UN confirms its intent to provide technical assistance until the Center is self-sufficient.
*   **Obligations of the UN (Article VI):** The UN will provide statistical experts (Principal Statistical Adviser, Senior Statistical Advisers) and possibly other staff, equipment, or assistance, subject to fund availability, consistent with the Revised Standard Agreement.
*   **Obligations of the Government (Article VII):**  The Government is obligated to provide a Director for the Center, faculty, staff, lecture rooms, laboratories, facilities, supplies, and equipment as per Article IV of the Revised Standard Agreement. The government must also contribute to the technical assistance by paying for or furnishing facilities and services.
*   **Termination (Article VIII):** Specifies a 120-day written notice period for termination by either party.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Government:**
    *   Financial obligation: Responsible for costs associated with facilities, staff, and equipment.
    *   Operational Obligation: Maintaining the Center and providing support for its activities.
    *   Reputational Risk: Failure to maintain the center's standards and operations.
*   **United Nations:**
    *   Financial obligation: Providing experts and possibly equipment, dependent on funding.
    *   Operational Obligation: Providing qualified statistical advisors.
    *   Reputational Risk: Failure to provide qualified advisors.
    *   Liability: Addressed by the Revised Standard Agreement (incorporated by reference).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Funding Dependency:** Both the UN and the Philippines' obligations are subject to the availability of funds. This creates uncertainty about long-term sustainability.
*   **Operational Control:** The division of responsibilities between the Coordination Board, Executive Committee, and the UP could lead to conflicts or inefficiencies.
*   **Definition of "Sufficiently Established":** The point at which the Center is deemed "sufficiently established" to function without UN assistance is subjective and could be a point of contention.
*   **Integration with Existing Structures:** Potential overlap or conflict with existing government statistical agencies (e.g., Bureau of Census and Statistics) needs consideration.
*   **Article VII incorporation of Article IV of the Revised Standard Agreement** The Government is obligated to provide the center with facilities but the lack of a specific budget or fixed contribution amount might cause disagreements in the future.
*   **Termination:** Either party can terminate the agreement, creating uncertainty around long-term stability.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Standard Agreement of 1954:**  Crucially important as this agreement provides foundational terms not detailed in the Supplementary Agreement. Any interpretation requires examination of the Revised Standard Agreement.
*   **University of the Philippines Charter:** Should be reviewed to understand the University's authority and responsibility regarding the Center.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "subject to the availability of funds" (found throughout the document) creates a significant loophole, allowing either party to potentially avoid their obligations.
