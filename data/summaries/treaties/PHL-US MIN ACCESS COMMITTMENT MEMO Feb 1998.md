This is a draft of the Philippines-US Tariff Rate Quota Agreement, which was signed on February 20, 1998. The agreement appears to be a modification to an existing administrative order (AO 8) and makes several changes to the MAV Plus Mechanism, including:

1. Eliminating the second-priority distribution in the MAV Plus Mechanism.
2. Allocating any remaining quota balance from the first priority distribution on a first-come, first-served basis.
3. Providing that MAVICs for allocation from the first-come, first-served distribution shall not be issued to licensees who have not fully utilized all of their unsurrendered quota.

The agreement also includes provisions related to transparency, monitoring, and additional consultations between the Philippines and the United States. Additionally, it sets out definitions, notifications to the WTO Committee on Agriculture, and reservations of rights.

Some key points about this agreement include:

* The agreement is designed to promote trade between the Philippines and the US in certain agricultural products.
* It includes provisions for the allocation of tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) to licensed importers.
* The agreement is subject to certain limitations and constraints, including the need for consultation between the two parties.
* It sets out procedures for notification to the WTO Committee on Agriculture and other relevant committees.

Overall, this agreement appears to be a significant development in the Philippines-US trade relationship, particularly with regards to agricultural products.
