This is a translation of the 1944 Brussels Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention. The convention sets standards for international air transport and defines the rules for the operation of aircraft in international aviation.

The text includes articles that outline the provisions of the convention, including:

* Article 35: Definitions
* Article 36: Jurisdiction
* Article 37: Organization
* Article 38: Adherence
* Article 39: Denunciation
* Article 40: Reservations and declarations

The convention also includes a protocol with reference to Article 2, which deals with the application of the convention to international transportation by air performed directly by the state or its territories.

The text lists the countries that have signed and ratified the convention as of December 31, 1965. These include many countries from around the world, including the United States, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, among others.

Note that this is a formal international treaty, and its provisions are still in force today.
