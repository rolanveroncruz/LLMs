## Trade Protocol Summary: Philippines - Bangladesh (1990)

**Document:** Trade Protocol between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh for 1990, signed October 10, 1989.

**Purpose:** To expand and diversify trade between the two countries, pursuant to Article 8 of the 1980 Trade Agreement. This protocol establishes specific trade arrangements and targets for 1990.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I & II: Import/Export Lists:** Lists goods each country is prepared to import from the other. These lists are *non-exclusive* and subject to the needs and capacity of both countries. Wording is permissive ("is prepared to import"), which creates **limited enforceability**.
*   **Article III: Pricing, Quality, and Currency:** Prices must be at "world market level" and quality must be of "acceptable standard." Contracts and invoices in USD. **Key Obligation:** Restriction against re-exporting imported items.
*   **Article IV: Licenses:** Competent authorities to issue import/export licenses *without undue delay*, subject to existing laws and regulations. This provision acknowledges sovereign regulatory power, potentially limiting enforceability if licenses are denied.
*   **Article V: Payment:** Transactions in convertible US dollars, subject to each country's laws and exchange control regulations. Allows for alternative payment arrangements by mutual agreement.
*   **Article VI: Special Trading Arrangement (STA):** Commitment to finalize a STA between TCB and PITC by December 1989 for a US$10 million exchange each way. Represents a *specific, time-bound obligation* with potential liability for failure to finalize.
*   **Article VII: Trade Target:** Aim for an overall trade target of US$40 million by December 31, 1990. This is a *target*, not a guarantee, and carries no legal obligation to achieve that number.
*   **Articles VIII-XI: Non-Binding Provisions:**  These sections cover encouraging information exchange, trade exhibitions, future meetings, and cooperation between Chambers of Commerce. These are aspirational and create no legally binding obligations.

**Obligations:**

*   Good faith effort to finalize the STA between TCB and PITC (Art. VI).
*   Restriction on re-exporting imported items (Art. III).
*   Issuance of import and export licenses without undue delay (Art. IV).

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability for failure to finalize the STA by the agreed deadline (Art. VI), although damages would be difficult to quantify.
*   Breach of re-export restriction (Art. III) would potentially lead to damages, potentially including disgorgement of profits.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforceability:** Much of the protocol uses permissive language and is subject to the laws and regulations of each country, making enforcement difficult.
*   **Ambiguity:** Terms like "world market level" and "acceptable standard" in Article III are vague and could lead to disputes. Consider *UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)* applicability for interpretation.
*   **Sovereign Risk:** Each party is subject to its own laws and regulations, creating the risk that actions taken under the protocol could be frustrated by domestic laws (e.g., import/export bans, currency controls).

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **1980 Trade Agreement:** The underlying basis of this protocol. Understanding the terms and conditions of that original agreement is essential.
*   **Domestic Import/Export Laws and Regulations:** Crucial for assessing the enforceability of the protocol. Research current regulations in both the Philippines and Bangladesh.
*   **UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG):**  Could be applicable to contracts entered into under the framework of the trade protocol, offering a framework for interpreting ambiguous terms and governing contract disputes.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   Article III ("world market level," "acceptable standard"): Subjective and potentially dispute-inducing.
*   Article IV ("without undue delay"): Vague timeframe, prone to differing interpretations.

**Recommendations:**

*   Thoroughly review the 1980 Trade Agreement.
*   Research current import/export laws and regulations in both countries.
*   Assess the CISG applicability to individual contracts under the protocol.
*   Advise clients on the limited enforceability of the protocol and the need for specific, well-defined contracts with clear terms and conditions.
