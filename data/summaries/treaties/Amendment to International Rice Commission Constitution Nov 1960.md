This appears to be a draft of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Constitution, likely from 1973 or shortly thereafter. Here's a breakdown of the key articles and provisions:

**Article IX: Territorial Application**

* Members must explicitly state which territories their participation extends to.
* If no declaration is made, participation applies to all territories for international relations where the member has responsibility.

**Article X (Amendments)**

* Amendments require a two-thirds majority vote of all Commission members.
* Amendments become effective only after concurrence by the Conference Council or Conference for approval.
* Members must accept amendments with new obligations before they take effect.
* The Director-General notifies Member nations and the Secretary-General of the United Nations of receipt and entry into force.

**Article XI: Interpretation and Dispute Settlement**

* Any dispute regarding interpretation or application must be referred to a committee composed of one member from each party, plus an independent chairman.
* Committee recommendations serve as a basis for renewed consideration by parties concerned.
* If disputes are not settled, they are referred to the International Court of Justice.

**Article XII (Acceptance and Withdrawal)**

* Members can withdraw from the Commission after one year from acceptance of this Constitution.
* Withdrawal takes effect six months after receipt by the Director-General.
* Member nations must be informed of withdrawal and its application to territories.

**Article XIII: Termination**

* The Constitution terminates when the number of Commission members drops below ten, unless the remaining members unanimously decide otherwise.

**Article XIV: Entry into Force**

* This Constitution enters into force upon receipt of notifications of acceptance from at least ten Member Nations representing half of the world's rice production (as shown in official statistics).

The UNCTAD Constitution was established to promote economic development and cooperation among nations. It aims to provide a forum for discussion, cooperation, and dispute resolution on issues related to trade, investment, technology transfer, and economic development.

Please note that this is likely a draft or an early version of the Constitution, as some articles (e.g., Article V) are missing or have been replaced.
