This appears to be a portion of the text from a trade agreement or protocol between various countries in Southeast Asia, specifically ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). The document outlines specific provisions and commitments related to trade in certain agricultural products, including rice.

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

1. **Highly Sensitive Products**: The list includes four types of rice:
	* Indonesia: Rice in the husk (paddy or rough) (HS Code 1006.10.000)
	* Malaysia: Husked (brown) rice (HS Code 1006.20.000)
	* Philippines: Semi-milled or wholly milled rice, whether or not polished or glazed (HS Code 1006.30.000)
	* The ending tariff rate for the Philippines is to be determined within the CEPT framework.
2. **Tariff Reduction**: The beginning tariff rates for these highly sensitive products will be the applied rates in the year of phasing in. The commitment on beginning rates does not prejudice the right of member states to maintain quantitative restrictions and other non-tariff barriers until 1 January 2010.
3. **Special Safeguards**: An ASEAN member country can raise its applicable tariffs to MFN levels when imports from ASEAN sources of highly sensitive commodities subject to the CEPT special concession reach a trigger level. The trigger level will be based on a formula that considers average imports, growth rate of share of imports from ASEAN, and growth rate of domestic consumption.
4. **ASEAN Concession Suspension**: When an import surge threatens domestic producers of the product, the ASEAN concession shall be suspended.

This document appears to be part of a broader trade agreement aimed at promoting economic integration and cooperation among ASEAN member states. The specific provisions and commitments outlined here reflect the parties' efforts to balance their trade interests with concerns about food security and protection of domestic industries.
