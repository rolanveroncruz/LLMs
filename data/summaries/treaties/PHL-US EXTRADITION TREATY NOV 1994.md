This is an excerpt from a treaty between the Philippines and the United States regarding extradition. Specifically, it outlines the procedures and rules for extradition, including:

1. The terms under which a person may be extradited to the Requesting State.
2. The duration of detention in the Requested State before extradition.
3. Conditions under which property related to an offense can be seized and surrendered.
4. Rules for transit through one state by another.
5. Representation and expenses for the requesting state.
6. Consultation between the two countries' departments of justice.
7. Application of the treaty to offenses committed before or after its entry into force.

Some key points include:

* A person may be extradited under this treaty if they have a connection to the offense, such as being involved in the commission or fleeing the crime scene.
* The Requested State (the country requesting extradition) must consent to extraditing an individual who has already been surrendered by another state.
* Extradition is contingent upon proper procedures and notices being given, including the possibility of revoking a request for extradition if new evidence emerges.

The treaty also includes provisions for representation, expenses, and consultation between the two countries' departments of justice.
