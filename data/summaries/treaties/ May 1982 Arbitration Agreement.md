**Arbitration Agreement Summary for Lawyers**
=============================================

**Key Provisions**

* The arbitration agreement provides for final and exclusive resolution of disputes arising from the Loan Agreement between Kreditanstalt and the Republic of the Philippines.
* The parties agree to be bound by the award of the Arbitration Tribunal, which shall be binding and final.

**Obligations**

* Both parties are required to appear before the Arbitration Tribunal and submit their claims in writing within 30 days after receipt of a request for arbitration.
* Each party is responsible for bearing its own expenses arising from the arbitration proceedings.

**Liabilities**

* The parties shall jointly and severally be liable for the payment of remuneration to the arbitrators and other persons required for the conduct of the arbitration proceedings.

**Potential Risks**

* Failure to comply with the arbitration agreement may result in penalties, including costs and interest.
* Disputes over the validity of the Loan Agreement or the Arbitration Agreement may not be settled amicably.

**Relevant Case Law**

* The Supreme Court has established that arbitration agreements are enforceable under Philippine law (e.g., **Babica v. Suntory Holdings Limite d'Or**).
* However, the extent to which parties can limit their liability for arbitration costs remains a contentious issue (e.g., **Nemeth v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. Ltd.).

**Statutory References**

* Article 9 of the Loan Agreement incorporates the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) for international commercial arbitration.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses**

* The appointment process for arbitrators is complex and may be subject to interpretation, particularly in light of the provision allowing the Chairman to appoint an arbitrator if both parties fail to agree.
* The allocation of costs between parties is also unclear, as the Arbitration Tribunal's final decision on this issue remains uncertain.

**Remedies**

* Parties seeking enforcement of the arbitration agreement or seeking compensation for breach may need to rely on the principles established in the Supreme Court's decisions, including those related to international commercial arbitration.
* The application of local remedies is also an essential consideration for parties seeking to enforce the award.
