**MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES AND THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY CONCERNING IMMIGRATION AND VISA MATTERS**

**Key Provisions:**

*   The Philippines and Germany agree to facilitate the entry into and sojourn in their territories of tourists, businessmen, technicians, and non-immigrant workers (Section 1)
*   German nationals can enter the Philippines for substantial trade or investment purposes, with the possibility of a three-year visa extension (Section 3(a))
*   The Philippine government agrees to admit German nationals and their families for short-term stays (Section 3(b) and (c))

**Obligations:**

*   Both parties must facilitate the entry into and sojourn in their territories, as per Section 1
*   Germany agrees to facilitate the entry of Filipino traders and investors (Section 4)

**Liabilities:**

*   Neither party is liable for the failure to grant visas or permits, unless there is a clear breach of contract or law

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity around "substantial" trade or investment**: The Memorandum of Understanding does not clearly define what constitutes substantial trade or investment. This could lead to disputes over visa applications and the duration of stays
*   **Expulsion or exclusion grounds**: Section 6 allows for the expulsion of individuals on grounds such as public order, health, morality, or safety. However, the specific criteria for these grounds are not clearly defined

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   None directly applicable, but the Supreme Court's interpretation of similar agreements may provide guidance.

**Statutory References:**

*   Section 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 of the Memorandum of Understanding are relevant to immigration and visa matters in both countries

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   Section 3(a): The duration of stays for German pre-arranged employees is unclear. A court may interpret this as a three-year maximum stay, but not necessarily an absolute limit
*   Section 6: The specific grounds for expulsion or exclusion are not clearly defined, which could lead to disputes over the application of these provisions
