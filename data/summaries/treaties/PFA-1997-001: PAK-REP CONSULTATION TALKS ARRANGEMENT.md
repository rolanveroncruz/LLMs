*   The Talks will be held annually, alternately in Manila and Islamabad, at the level of Under Secretary/Assistant Secretary (Philippines) and Foreign Secretary/Additional Foreign Secretary (Pakistan).
*   The main purpose of the Talks is to exchange views on matters of mutual concern, international or regional issues, and other topics mutually agreed upon by the Parties.
*   The agenda of the Talks will be defined in advance through mutual agreement.
*   The Arrangement can be amended or supplemented by mutual consent of the Parties.

**Obligations:**

*   Both Parties are obligated to participate in the Talks and engage in constructive dialogue on matters of mutual interest.
*   The Parties agree to define the agenda of the Talks in advance, which will help ensure that the discussions remain focused and productive.

**Liabilities:**

*   Neither Party is liable for any damages or losses arising from the failure of either Party to participate in the Talks or fulfill their obligations under this Arrangement.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The arrangement's reliance on mutual consent for amendments or supplements may lead to disputes between the Parties if they cannot agree on changes.
*   The automatic renewal provision, which allows either Party to terminate the agreement six months prior to its expiry, creates a risk that the Talks may be disrupted or terminated prematurely.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   This arrangement does not appear to draw directly from any specific case law or statutory references. However, it is essential to note that international agreements like this one are often subject to interpretation by courts and tribunals.
*   The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) may provide relevant guidance on the rights and obligations of diplomatic missions and their representatives.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   Article V's provision allowing for amendments or supplements by mutual consent of the Parties may be subject to interpretation. It is crucial to determine how each Party will exercise this right and whether there are any limitations or restrictions on its use.
*   The automatic renewal provision in Article VI may raise questions about the Parties' ability to terminate the agreement before its expiry period has expired.
