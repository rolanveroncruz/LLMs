## Summary of UK/Philippines Debt Agreement No. 2 (1987)

**Nature of Document:** This is an international agreement between the United Kingdom (UK) and the Philippines, formalized through an exchange of diplomatic notes, concerning the consolidation of Philippine debt owed to UK creditors. It builds upon the Agreed Minute signed in Paris on January 22, 1987, and supersedes any conflicting terms from the Previous Agreement signed on 4 February 1986.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Debt Definition (Section 2(1)):** Defines eligible debt as amounts (principal and contractual interest accruing up to Maturity) owed by the Philippines or its agencies to UK creditors, arising from contracts (pre-April 1, 1984) for goods/services/financing exceeding one-year credit terms. The debt must have fallen or will fall due during the Consolidation Period (January 1, 1987 â€“ June 30, 1988) and be guaranteed by the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) and not payable in Philippine pesos. Specifically excludes debts arising from amount payable upon or as a condition of, the formation of the Contract, or as a condition of the cancellation or termination of the Contract, or those already covered by the previous agreement.
*   **Debt List (Section 2(2)):** Requires the creation and ongoing maintenance of a debt list, to be agreed upon by the UK Department (ECGD) and the Central Bank of the Philippines. Any amendments require mutual agreement.
*   **Refinancing Loans (Section 3):** Obligates the UK (through the Department) to use its best efforts to arrange refinancing loans (denominated in GBP or USD) via UK banks or lending institutions to cover debts owed to Recognised Banks (those with ECGD guarantees). This refinancing covers 100% of principal and 70% of contractual interest due during the Consolidation Period.
*   **Repayment Terms (Section 3(2), Section 4(1)):** The Philippines is obligated to repay the refinancing loans and non-refinanced debt in ten equal, consecutive, half-yearly installments starting April 1, 1993.
*   **Interest Rates (Section 3(3), Section 5(4)):** Refinancing loans bear interest at 0.5% above the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Interest on non-refinanced debt is 0.5% above the "Reference Rate" (determined bi-annually).
*   **Transfer Scheme for Non-Refinanced Debt (Section 4):** For debts not refinanced, the Philippines must pay the Department 100% of principal and 70% of contractual interest in installments, with the remaining 30% of contractual interest to be paid directly to the Creditor on the original due date.
*   **Payments to the Department (Section 6):** The Central Bank of the Philippines is responsible for transferring payments to the Department in the currency of the debt, without any deductions for Philippine taxes or fees.
*   **Most Favored Nation (Section 8(1)):** The Philippines agrees to terms no less favorable than those granted to any other creditor country, as per the Agreed Minute (excluding interest rate provisions).
*   **Preservation of Rights (Section 9):** The agreement doesn't affect creditor/debtor rights and obligations under the original contract, except where the respective governments are authorized to act on their behalf.

**Obligations:**

*   **Philippines:** Repayment of principal and interest, payment of interest on non-refinanced debt, cooperation in creating and maintaining the debt list, adherence to terms no less favorable than other creditor nations.
*   **UK:** Best efforts to secure refinancing loans, providing information for implementation.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Philippines:** Non-payment of principal and interest leads to potential default and enforcement actions. Liability for overdue interest on unpaid interest (Section 5(3)).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **LIBOR Transition/Successor Rates:** The agreement uses LIBOR as the reference rate, which has been phased out. The absence of specific fallback provisions may lead to disputes regarding applicable interest rates.
*   **"Best Efforts" Standard:** The UK's obligation to secure refinancing loans is qualified by "best efforts," which is a flexible standard and may be difficult to enforce.
*   **Definition of "Contract" and "Debt":** Ambiguities in the definitions of "Contract" and "Debt" could lead to disputes over eligibility for debt relief. Specifically, defining which supplemental agreements would also fall under the definition of "Contract".
*   **Interpretation of "Terms no less favourable":** Section 8's requirement of granting the UK "terms no less favourable" than other creditor nations is subject to interpretation and potential disputes.
*   **Currency Fluctuations:** As the agreement involves debts in multiple currencies, fluctuations could impact the cost of repayment for the Philippines.
*   **Breach of Underlying Contracts:** While Section 9 preserves creditor/debtor rights under the original contracts, a breach of those contracts could have implications for the debt restructuring under this agreement.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   This document is primarily contractual in nature and interprets in light of contract law principles like: (1) *Pacta sunt servanda*, and (2) *rebus sic stantibus*.
*   The Agreed Minute referred to throughout would be a valuable piece of information for interpreting this agreement.
*   Philippine laws governing government contracts and debt obligations would be relevant.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "best efforts" clause in Section 3(1) is a common source of disputes, as it lacks a precise definition.
*   The lack of specific fallback provisions for the LIBOR rate is a potential area of contention, especially since the reference banks need to be agreed upon.
*   The definition of "Contract" and the criteria for determining debts eligible for relief are open to interpretation.
*   Defining if the Philippine government has been given "terms no less favourable" will be contentious if, in retrospect, other creditors obtained a substantially better deal.
