## Summary of Treaty of Conciliation Between the Philippines and the United States of America (1946)

**Nature of Document:** Treaty of Conciliation between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America. **Important caveat: This treaty was signed in 1946, but never ratified by the US Senate.**

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article I: Dispute Resolution Mechanism:** Establishes a conciliation process for disputes of any nature between the two governments when diplomatic means and adjudication by a competent tribunal have failed.
*   **Article II: International Commission of Conciliation:** Creates a permanent International Commission of Conciliation (ICC) comprised of five members (one appointed by each country, one by each country from a third country, and a fifth mutually agreed upon from a third country). Mandates the constitution of the ICC within six months of ratification and outlines the payment of expenses.
*   **Article III: Conciliation Process:** Requires referral of unresolved disputes to the ICC. Allows the ICC to spontaneously offer its services. Stipulates cooperation by both parties with the ICC's investigation. Sets a one-year timeframe for the ICC's report, including recommendations for settlement. If no settlement is reached after the ICC's report, both parties agree to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) per Article 36 of its Statute and agree to be bound by the ICJ's decision.
*   **Article IV: Ratification and Termination:** Requires ratification by the Philippines according to its laws and by the U.S. with Senate consent. Defines the effective date as the date of exchange of ratifications. Provides for termination with one year's written notice.

**Obligations:**

*   **Both Parties:** Obligation to submit unresolved disputes to the ICC. Obligation to cooperate with the ICC's investigation, furnishing all means and facilities. Obligation to submit to the jurisdiction of the ICJ and be bound by its decision if conciliation fails.
*   **Philippines:** Obligation to ratify according to its constitutional laws.
*   **United States:** Obligation to ratify with the advice and consent of the Senate.
*   **ICC:** Obligation to investigate, report, and recommend settlement within a specified timeframe.

**Liabilities:** None explicitly stated, but failure to comply with obligations could lead to international censure or reputational damage.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Ratification:** The primary risk is the *treaty has not been ratified by the U.S. Senate*. This renders the treaty non-binding on the United States. Any reliance on the treaty's provisions would be highly problematic.
*   **Ambiguity:** The definition of "ordinary diplomatic proceedings" that must fail before invoking the treaty could be subject to interpretation. The phrase “adjudication by a competent tribunal” is not defined and may lead to disputes regarding its scope.
*   **Enforcement:** While the treaty mandates ICJ submission upon conciliation failure, enforcement of the ICJ decision ultimately depends on the willingness of both parties to comply and the ICJ's powers under the UN Charter.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice:** Pertains to the ICJ's jurisdiction, particularly regarding cases that parties refer to it. *See also: Statute of the International Court of Justice.*
*   **Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:** (Assuming it applies, depending on the Philippines' and the U.S.'s status as parties to it at the relevant time) It is likely that the general principles of treaty law apply, notably regarding interpretation (Articles 31-33)
*   **Case Law on Treaty Interpretation:** Relevant case law of the ICJ and national courts concerning treaty interpretation could be relevant in determining the meaning of ambiguous terms.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Article I:** The undefined terms "ordinary diplomatic proceedings" and "adjudication by a competent tribunal" have room for conflicting interpretation.
*   **Lack of Ratification by the U.S.:** This renders the entire treaty's enforceability questionable.

**Conclusion:**

While the treaty establishes a mechanism for dispute resolution, the **critical issue is the U.S. Senate's failure to ratify it.** This significantly diminishes its legal standing. If the treaty is being invoked, a thorough examination of its current status under international law and any potential subsequent agreements between the Philippines and the United States is crucial. Further investigation is needed to ascertain if this treaty is applicable.
