**Taxation**: The agreement does not oblige either country to extend tax privileges, exemptions, or reductions to natural persons or companies resident in the other country.

**Labor Mobility**: The countries agree to give sympathetic consideration to applications for work permits and entry of employed persons who wish to enter the territory of the other country in connection with an investment (Article 3).
