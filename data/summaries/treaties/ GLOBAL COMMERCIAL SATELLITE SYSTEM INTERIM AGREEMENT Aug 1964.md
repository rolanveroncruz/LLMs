This is a copy of the Interim Agreement Relating to the International Telecommunication Satellite System, also known as the "Satellite Agreement", which was signed on August 20, 1964, by representatives of 17 countries. The agreement established the framework for the use of commercial communications satellites in the field of international satellite telecommunications.

The agreement consists of several articles and an annex that lists the participating countries. Article 10 specifically deals with the allocation of satellite orbits, and paragraph (g) of this article was modified in 1965 to reflect changes agreed upon by the governments involved.

Here's a brief overview of the key aspects of the agreement:

1. **Purpose**: The agreement aimed to provide a framework for the use of commercial communications satellites in international satellite telecommunications.
2. **Participating countries**: The agreement was signed by representatives of 17 countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
3. **Satellite orbits**: Article 10 allocated satellite orbits to participating countries, with each country being assigned a specific range of orbital positions.
4. **Modification of paragraph (g) of Article 10**: The French language text of the agreement was modified in 1965 to reflect changes agreed upon by the governments involved. This modification reflected the inclusion of work performed under contracts that involve satellite communications.

The agreement marked an important step in the development of international cooperation on space exploration and telecommunications, and it paved the way for the creation of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 1934.
