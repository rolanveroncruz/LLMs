This is a copy of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Australia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), specifically related to the AusAID Development Assistance Cooperation Program (ADCP). The MOU outlines the cooperation between the two parties in implementing ADCP projects, including the waiver of intellectual property rights, privileges for personnel involved in AADCP projects, and general provisions.

Here are some key points from the MOU:

1. **Waiver of Intellectual Property Rights**: AusAID will endeavour to obtain assignments of right, title, and interest in intellectual property from other Australian Government departments or agencies to enable the scope of the waiver to be broadened.
2. **Privileges for Personnel**: The MOU provides privileges for Australian and ASEAN personnel involved in AADCP projects, including exemptions from taxes, levies, duties, fees, and charges, expedited clearance through customs, and facilitation of movement and transport.
3. **Amendments and Termination**: The MOU may be amended by an Exchange of Notes between the Parties, and either party may terminate the agreement with six months' notice in writing.
4. **Extension**: The MOU may be extended by an Exchange of Notes between the Parties.
5. **Date of Entry into Force**: The MOU will take effect from the first day of the month following the date on which the Parties have notified each other of the completion of the procedures necessary for entry into force.

The MOU is a formal agreement between Australia and ASEAN to cooperate in implementing AADCP projects, and it outlines the terms and conditions of their cooperation.
