This is not a declaration or treaty, but rather a set of articles that govern the financial management and administration of an international organization. Specifically, it appears to be the "Articles of Agreement" governing the International Labour Organization (ILO).

The text outlines the rules and procedures for managing the ILO's finances, including contributions from member states, budgeting, accounting, auditing, and dissolution in case of bankruptcy or other financial difficulties.

Here are some key points from the articles:

1. **Contributions**: Member states must pay their annual contributions on January 1st, with payment due by June 30th.
2. **Budgeting**: The Directing Committee is responsible for preparing a budget, which is submitted to the Finance Committee for review and approval.
3. **Expenditures**: Expenditures must conform to the approved budget, and no expenditure exceeding 1,000 gold francs can be incurred without prior approval from the Directing Committee.
4. **Reserve fund**: The organization has a reserve fund that is used to meet extraordinary expenditures.
5. **Audit**: An external auditor ensures that expenditures are appropriate and conform to directives given by the Conference.
6. **Dissolution**: In case of dissolution, the balance of accounts will be divided among member states in proportion to their contributions since 1921.

Overall, these articles provide a framework for managing the ILO's finances and ensuring its stability and effectiveness.
